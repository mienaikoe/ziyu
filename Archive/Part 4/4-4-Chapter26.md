## Chapter 26

In the distance, the somber cries of a man resounded from the crater, interspersed with fits of coughing. I stopped in my tracks and looked to Pomri who was close behind. She hadn't heard a thing. At first I thought my ears betrayed me, but as we kept walking, the sound grew in volume and I was compelled by instinct to run toward the cry and help. Pomri was behind me screaming "Wait!" but I did not stop. It was a mere moment before I saw him through the dust, knealing with his hands behind his head and nodding his torso back and forth. I came upon him, yelling, "Aey. you alright?" but there was no answer. It was no longer clear if he was laughing or crying.

I illuminated his figure with the light of my legs. Deep scrapes and cuts marred his clothes and skin. Some were superficial, but most showed signs of blood loss. His eyes were bloodshot, and his face caked with black ash. It took him a moment to stop his nodding and realize my presence.

Through trembling lips, he stammered, "W...Who..?" but his eyes only fixated on the light. Suddenly, his hands lurched forward and grasped my ankles tightly. A reflex jolted me backward, falling to the ground, with half of my body hanging over the crater edge, my hands scraping and clambering for a solid bit of land. I looked below me into a black void, its depth was unknowable, but I knew I would certainly die if he let go.

"YOU DID THIS!" He roared at me as he pushed me away.

For a single point in time, I hung in the air, the assurance of death pulling me down to its bosom. I knew this feeling when my legs went numb in the waters of Ulukoma. When I first experienced Kanosin as a curious child in my mother's bedroom. It was familiar, neither friend nor enemy. An apparition that revealed itself on occasion. But each time a hand would reach out, pulling me from the figment of death. Setre, Kipnu.

This time it was Pomri, grasping my wrist just in time. She barely exerted herself pulling me up with one arm, and quickly pivoting to restrain the mysterious man. She grappled him by his arm and he panicked, stumbling on himself and wheezing heavily as he tried to get away.

"Speak!" she demanded, but still he didn't respond.

"I have nothing to give you, Holragi scum," he said staring at her feet. "Take my life or leave me to my suffering," he said.

"Jathi?" she asked, bewildered at seeing his face again, "Is that you?"

He remained there, motionless, fighting back a cough and holding his right hand to the back of his head.

"How did you survive?"

But still he did not move.

"He can't hear you," I chimed.

Pomri glanced back at me, apprehensive. Instead of fighting with her, I approached him slowly and held out my hand, to which he responded with his own. Upon his palm, I placed a finger and drew the words I wanted to say. _L-I-N-Y-U_, first, and then pointed to myself. Then _P-O-M-R-I_. His eyes lit up ever so slightly as if he knew that name, but he didn't look in her direction, only at me.

"I know Pomri. She warned us early. Got most of us out."

"Jathi... how did?" Pomri said. She was moved to tears.

It occured to me that he may not yet have realized that he had gone deaf and partially blind.

"Ask him what happened," Pomri asked.

_W-H-A-T-H-A-P-P-_, he paused me, signaling that he understood.

"I was at the observatory–," he winced at some pain in his body. "...Holrag. Had a m-m-message t-to send; a m-m-m of great importance. I didn't make it, did I?... That's-s okay though. Now you're h-h-here."

"That's great, Jathi," said Pomri, "What was the message?"

_W-H-A-T-W-A-S-M-E-S_

"The message?... The mess-HUNDRED LIFET-essage. Many. Message... M-m-many lifetimes -essage."

"Hundred lifetimes? I don't understand." said Pomri, urgently.

She moved closer to him, holding the illuminated hand to her face so he could read her lips.

"Try to remember," she demanded.

"S-sai-sll," he cried under his breath. "I can't...can't..."

"Sail? From a boat?" she asked, "To where?"

"Remember... rem -m -m."

He began to hit his head in frustration, but Pomri held his arms back after a few hits, and he stopped gesticulating. Instead, his pupils began to constrict and we watched as his mind began to slip backward in time.

"Come on," she said, worried, "Stay awake."

As quickly as he slipped under, he slipped back into reality.

"Who are you?" he demanded, "...I-I have nothing to give – go away!"

He turned and shuffled away from us with his hand still holding the back of his head. A fit of violent coughing overcame him as if he had been struggling to hold it in and he was forced to rest against a boulder to regain his breath, still holding his free hand out to ward us off.

"Leave me be," he growled, almost whispering.

Pomri was insistent. She approached him, trying to reassure him that she was not there for malice. But he refused her, curling up into himself. With each refusal, she broke down a little bit more until she finally knealt before him and wept. At a safe distance, he resumed his nodding and gesticulating, a hand still behind his head.

I knealt near Pomri a while with my hand on her back, imagining the kind of man he might have been, who he might have loved. I didn't know Jathi, but Pomri seemed to hold him in high regard.

"There is no justice to deliver," she said under her breath. "No greater good that could ever make this right."

I could feel the weight of her words stirring the same fire and vitriol that she felt in her own heart. If this was the end of life on Palinan, we would not surely not go out as a flickering flame, but as frozen statues on a battlefield of our creation.

Then Pomri asked me, "Linyu. Do you have any more kanosin?"

I hesitated, confused for a moment.

"It... it won't work"

"Won't work. What do you mean?"

"Kanosin... can reverse death. But memories..."

She spoke in earnest, "He can make new memories. In a new life. One without pain."

"Without pain..." I murmured.

I dug into my satchel, ensuring that there was only one left and I produced it with the accompanying syringe. I filled the syringe while she tore off a large piece of her guard trousers, exposing more of the leg she had illuminated, and wiped it clean from ash. A brief struggle found him on his side as she bound his arms behind him and elevated his head with her satchel below his neck. He no longer fought. Perhaps he had come to accept his anticipated death. She accepted the syringe from my hand with no sign of reluctance. Perhaps she had come to understood that the virtue of a thing is in its use.

"The left heart, five fingers from the center," I said, reassuringly. "Directly in."

She nodded, measuring with her fingers, priming the syringe, and plunging the needle into his heart. Jathi's eyes began to dilate as a faint blue glow, obscured by skin, filled his body and all of his muscles settled into the land.

"What happens now?"

It was best not to tell her the truth.

"Sleep. For a whole day."

"And then he rises?"

"And then he rises."

Pomri unbound his wrists and wrapped the cloth around Jathi's head to cushion against the wound. With a quick lift, she lofted him up and let him rest gently over her shoulder.

"Let's take him home."

The blue light in Pomri's hand illuminated a heavily damaged sign beside the path. _eik...servato... Ara_

She looked it over in detail and said, "looks like it's far enough from the city that the explosion left it intact for the most part."

"I've been here before," I said, remembering bits and pieces from the night I was found.

"Melna mentioned that she found you somewhere around here."

She approached the sign and prefaced her actions

"Before we go..."

With one hand, she broke off the long piece of wood that said _eik_ and cut it into a thinner piece with the blade of her spear, making sure to smooth out any potential splinters or hanging sharp bits.

"Use this for stability," she said, holding one of the pieces out to me. I took it in my hands and looked for the word. It too, had been smoothed out.

"Come on," she said. "The quicker we move, the quicker we rest."

My legs ached twice as much when I presented them with the idea of walking upward, but I regaled them with thoughts of soft chairs and warm beds and we reached a arrangement.

The mountain was dead save for a few blots of shrubbery that grew in the crevasses facing Ara. They were on their way out. The absence of wind is what took me by surprise. No cold bites or violent gusts. Just stagnant air and the dust that hung upon it. Ahead of Pomri, my legs lit the way. In a way, her presence behind me was my motivation to push through the aches in my legs and feet. I feared her anger.

At a wide area of the cliff, we paused for Pomri to take a break and change her carry.

"The mountain was shorter a day ago," she said, as she laid Jathi down with the gentlest of movements.

I was confused. "Shorter? How?"

She chuckled as she took a sip from her canteen. "No.. It's a joke."

"I don't get it." I really didn't.

"It's..." she sighed, "Nevermind."

I pondered how a mountain could grow overnight. _Pomri is so weird._

The view from up here was clear, facing to the south, toward the bay and eventually Holrag. I could see patterns in the land: rocks that had tumbled across the landscape, carving lines and divots that all met at the center of the crater. There were some trees dotting the land between farms, but a particular tree caught my attention. It stood tall, guarded from the blast by the hill and home adjacent. Its branches grew wide in a semihemisphere with leaves that were densely packed though many had begun to fall. I knew the patterns of this one when I had met Melna.

"Pomri, is that where Melna lives?" I pointed to the place in question.

She looked for it for a moment and understood what I was pointing toward.

"Yea! That's where she took you the night she found you. Good eye."

"About Liffa... Did thi know about radio?"

"Radio? No, no one's been talking to trees that I know of. Apparently it has a song in the mornings though, when the dew is beginning to evaporate."

"The mornings," I said. "My mother used to sing in the morning too when we lived in the forest."

"Thing's been singing and growing for at least three generations. Looks to be even older than that. Sort of a legend in town – Glad it survived."

With the same gentleness she had shown him before, she took Jathi upon her back while I stared at the tree.

"Oi. Come on," she beckoned.

---

The observatory was not as I expected it. There were no windows to be broken or walls to be split. It had been built into the ground, or perhaps the ground had been built around it. A set of three large metallic hatches protruded from the ground on the side facing Ara, closed to the elements. On the Ulu-side was a simple-looking wooden entryway with a wooden bell hung from a thick rope. Whether out of habit or the desire for some normalcy, Pomri jostled the wooden bell three times. Eager to rest, I lifted the latch and opened the door before she could finish her announcement of arrival.

I found a warm area in middle of the room, where a carpet had been laid between two chairs, and sprawled out on the floor, removing my shawl and bag after.

"I'm sooo tiiiired," I said, stretching my limbs. My heavy breathing was more noticeable in the quiet of the place.

Pomri knealt down beside me and gently rested Jathi on the ground. She ventured to some dark corner of the room, as if distinctly familiar with this place, and returned with a pillow in her hands. Slowly, her hands raised Jathi's cold glowing body and gently rested it upon the pillow.

"You can sleep later," she glanced at me with her voice. "Come, we need to look for the message."

Her dark lantern rocked about with a subtle metallic creak as she rummaged through the place, moving quickly in the dark but never missing a step. A modest hearth with an empty pot took up the back side of the one room building. To the left and right was the rest of it, mostly instruments and tools and shelves full of records.

"Ah!" she exclaimed, moving to a workbench. From a cabinet underneath, she pulled a large, thick, glass canister and popped a cork with her fingers. As she poured its contents into the lantern's upper tank, a distinctively floral aroma filled the room.

"What _is_ that?" I asked.

"Oil of Anomin. It's a thick oil from the bran of anomin grains. We use it to lubricate machines, and to do this..."

With a firestarter just above the oil pool of her lantern, she lit the flame again and the area around her was instantly illuminated. Shadows of kanosin blue and a firey red were cast against the wood of the table and the floor, reflected on the water of her skin, swallowed by the deep black of the painted wall.

"Right then. Let's find this message."

I groaned in agony. She took a moment to glance at me, as if to hurry me without words.

"Sorry, o supreme leader, but your nap will have to wait."

She walked to the back of the room, where the strange protrusions from the outside entered the room as a row of metal cylinders. Below each one was a large table, their tops made of smoothly ground patternless stone. Pomri's hand found a mechanism that was built into the ceiling, and a faint circle suddenly appeared upon the table in front of us.

"This is a telescopic projector for Ara. I haven't the slightest clue how it works, but maybe you'll find something if you just play around with it."

She turned to move away, but stopped herself and said, "Oh, and don't put your fingers on anything glass. Jathi would be furious."

The knobs and levers had been polished with use and gleamed in the faint light on the table, and I looked up to her in awe. She snickered and left me to my devices while she moved to a different desk with a mess of papers that seemed to have been left in a hurry.

I peered at the circular light cast on the table with a discerning eye – just a blob of light; nothing particularly interesting. Just above me, a thick dial jutted out of a sturdy metal box attached to the cylinder. On the visible part were numbers that went up and down by tens. In my fingers, the dial turned smoothly and the projector seemed to slowly reveal a pattern when this dial was turned to a certain number, but I could barely make out what the image was.

Next to the dial was a red metal lever that seemed to fasten something. I pulled the lever and it released with a _tang_ that reverberated through the metal cylinder and loosened something hidden inside. Gently, I pulled on the loosened bit and uncovered a beautiful disc of glass set into a large rectangular metallic frame. I held it up to Pomri who took a break to look my way. Through the glass she was far-away and upside-down, and to her I suppose my eye was as big as the lens itself. She may have giggled in the dark and bore a smile for just a moment, but if she did, I couldn't tell.

I set the lens down and searched for somewhere I might find more. Below the table was an unmarked wooden crate worn by decades of use. Inside of it, a neatly-arranged assortment of lens frames, all with varying writings on their kelp-paper envelopes. Some had much thicker lenses in them, some were tinted, and others were completely black. I inserted a few that seemed thinner and saw them make smaller, brighter circles on the table, so I decided to go the other way. At the other end of the box was the thickest lens of them all. The writing on the envelope said "First Obscura Observation | projector 4 | 5/2/11/5 6-to 12:4:0". I carefully swapped out the thin lens with this heavier large lens, making sure not to put my fingers on the glass, and closed the lever again. And When I turned the dial again to focus the image, a small but clear pattern emerged.

"Pomri," I called to her fearfully.

She came to my side and looked intently at the table. Thousands of miniscule circles of light dotted the table in a staggered formation.

"What kind of lens is that?"

"It's... a plain lens."

She gasped. "That's. The obscura?"

She moved closer and turned the focus knob to clarify the image, looking for some detail to make sense of the pattern.

"By Ara..."

The perfection of the shape, the enormity of the structure, it was like a dream of surreality within reality. The obscura was merely a figment before, some cartoonish cloud in space. But this is the moment when the weight of the obscura was unmistakeably, suffocatingly present. This was not a passing phenomenon; there was no enemy to fight or details to negotiate. This was an insuperable wall without a builder, and we stood alone in its shadow.

Pomri whispered, "Liffa."

Confused, I looked up to watch her staring deeply into the light, her finger pointing to one of the circles near the center. I leaned in to get a closer and sure enough, I saw a dot in front of one of the circles.

"Liffa," I said in response. "Liffa is coming home!"

"Jathi," Pomri had a smirk on her face, "That bastard always had an eye for hae."

"You don't suppose that was the message, do you?" I asked.

"'A message of great importance'," she said out loud. "It must be something else. Did you see any papers on this table?"

"I saw a black lens in the box," I told her. "There was a lot of writing on it."

"Show it to me."

I went over to the box again and pulled out the lens. It was in a darker kelp envelope with an ashwritten table of numbers on the one side. _Ash. A strange choice._ The other side was blank.

"Days and times," said Pomri, "What were they tracking?"

Her eyes moved to the last known values in the table. They were circled and seemed to be increasing.

"Something happened recently," she said, "Linyu, put this into the chamber. Let's see what Jathi and the others saw."

I took the lens, consciously feeling its weight to ensure I didn't drop it, and noticed that it was lighter than the others. Raising my hands, I prepared to take the big lens out but before I pulled the lever I noticed another one, blue and apparently new, hidden in the darkness further up the cylinder. I stared at it, confused.

"Everything ok?" she asked.

"It's a strange lens, this black one. Don't you think?"

"Very strange. Never seen it before. Must be a custom piece that Jathi had made recently."

On a gut feeling, I held the black lens up to the light shining on the table, and all of the light disappeared, as expected.

"This doesn't make sense," I said.

Pomri moved the envelope closer to read the table again and find some sort of clue and at the corner, a green speck of light appeared where the projector had shone before.

"Pomri! Move the envelope into the light," I said.

and as she shifted it, the same patterns as before began to emerge in green light, but blurry and hazy.

"Ah!" I said as I turned to reach for the blue lever. With a great deal of effort, I flipped it open to reveal an empty chamber and loaded the black glass. Immediately the pattern emerged on the envelope in the same green hue.

"Invisible light," I said aloud. My mind was full of connections.

"Hm. What's this?" said Pomri, her hand in the envelope. A collection of blank papers appeared in her hand, with a mess of indents that seemed to suggest that there was some sort of writing on it.

"Put it in the light," I suggested. She did so, and the writing appeared on the papers in that green hue.

Pomri read the messages out loud:

"

```
Obscura Observation + day 2, tick 9504
Jathi,

I found your message and made my own projections. I am sure that we came to the same conclusion. Hopefully you abandoned your quest to find me and told someone else, but in case you haven't, I am leaving now to deliver the message to whoever I can find in the city. Hopefully the Holragi haven't gotten to it first.

This may be the last time we speak. It's been–
```

"

She paused to let a wave of sorrow come and go, then continued with the last part of the note.

"

```
It's been an honor, Jathi.

- Thimlu

(The lenses really need to be cleaned...)
```

"

She took a deep breath and flipped the page.

"

```
Obscura Observation + day 2, tick 6336
Thimlu,

I've double-checked my calculations and assumptions, and they must be correct. I still struggle to wrap my head around the immensity of the scales we're dealing with.

The obscura must be aware of what they're doing. We must get this information out as quickly as possible, so I'm leaving to find you.

-Jathi

(No time to clean the lenses)
```

"

"

```
Obscura Observation + day 2, tick 6048
Lab Note

233 ticks ago, I measured it again. The ultraviolet emission of Ara is increasing while infrared decreases, noting a shift in temperature toward a hotter star. The surface area of the obscura continues to grow linearly as well. I have no doubt that the two are linked.

I took your advice and devised a projection of what would happen to Ara if the obscura is actually a sphere instead of the disc that the Holragi observers seem to report. Your hypothesis that the stellar wind pressure would rise exponentially was correct, but the time scale is staggering. It would take thousands of days for the temperature to rise high enough. I am just an apprentice observer, and certainly am no engineer, but I believ that there is a point at which the obscura can no longer hold itself together and it will break. The exact timing of this depends on how the obscura is constructed, but once this happens, it will send the obscura hurtling away from Ara at an unimaginable speed. And without a doubt, this would send a flurry of radiation to Palinan.

Our people are resilient, but we're talking a hundred lifetimes (give or take about twenty)... nothing could last that long without Ara.

-Jathi

(I will clean the lenses after my shift, as you asked)
```

"

"A hundred lifetimes," I said, struggling to imagine a time so vast.

But Pomri seemed agitated, angry almost. She stuffed the notes back into the envelope and removed the ultraviolet filter, reverting the projector to its old, normal state. Its light seemed to illuminate the desk much more after being in dim light for a while, casting shadows of ourselves upon the walls.

"We found the message. Let's go back to Ulukoma."

"Shouldn't we take him with us?" I used my nose to point at Jathi.

"He'll be fine here."

"But the Holragi. His memories."

She lowered herself to me and looked intently into my eyes.

"We have to go," she said. Behind her eyes, she whispered, "He's a dead man."

While Pomri packed away a few useful supplies she found around the room, I gently set the filter on the table and found a nearly unused swatch of soft fabric I had found at another desk. Before putting it away, I noticed that a black dot had emerged in one of the circles, drifting from one side of the circle to another, small enough to be easily missed.

"Liffa," I said under my breath, and I imagined embracing this stranger that I felt I'd known my whole life. I turned the envelope over in my hands, thinking this would be the lens Jathi used to track Liffa, and sure enough I saw a note scribbled at the bottom in regular black ink - barely visible except at an angle of reflection.

```
Liffa Return Trajectory

On Obscura day 0 tick 18548, I inspected the spacerail and The agreed and checked trajectory is as follows:

First Bleed Entry: Over Heiko Center, Obscura + day 4, tick 6192
Second Bleed Entry: Over Holragi-Spacerail, Obscura + day 4, tick 13824
Final Approach: Ulukoma + 31600 paces to Ulu, Obscura + day 4, tick 19872

- Jathi

(Godspeed, Liffa)
```

"d4 t19872 UK + 31600p Ulu" I said aloud as I wrote on my arm. "You are not forgotten, Liffa. I'm coming for you."

I packed my things while Pomri wrote a note for Jathi, in the inevitable case that he woke up disoriented and confused. We didn't know if he'd understand language or writing when he woke, but it was worth a try. Even for a dead man.

The door ushered us back out into the dark and the cold, but in my mind I was still there, lingering on the image of the motionless man, helplessly grasping at a thousand failures to help in his darkest moments. Before the dust swallowed the observatory, I went back to the moment I recognized his nodding silhouette, recalled his phantom pains and ashen face. I internalized the broken man. And I promised myself never to forget.
