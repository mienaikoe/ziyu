<p>"Oi, Jathi," He greeted his apprentice.</p>
<p>"You're awake. Well that's odd. Usually you're under a blanket at the hearth by now."</p>
<p>"Observer Thimlu!" Jathi exclaimed, abruptly standing up to greet him. His eyes were sharp with adrenaline, darkened by swelling under his eyes.</p>
<p>"Don't tell me," said Thimlu. He paused to take a deep breath, then walked calmly to his desk and began to write a note.</p>
<p>"How much?" he asked him.</p>
<p>Jathi replied, hesitant, "10% coverage, sir. Last night it was–"</p>
<p>"Four, yes I know," he said in a hurried tone.</p>
<p>"Take this note to Melna before she leaves for the senate," said Thimlu.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," said Jathi. He took the note and turned to tidy the table he was at.</p>
<p>"Leave the lenses," said Thimlu, "Go!"</p>
<p>"Sorry," said Jathi. "Instinct."</p>
<p>He tossed his coat on his back and opened the door to the summit of the observatory mountain. The morning breeze was on its first breath, making streaks in the fog below, and the water in his hydroderm swell. With a drink from the last of his water, he hurried down the mountain to the city below, carrying the weight of the world in his pocket.</p></div>

<p><em>You cannot hear the first note of a ziyu's song. There is no grand entrance or catchy hook. No meandering conversation between a point and its counter. Each leaf is a gentle voice in a choir of the wind, finding its voice with the morning breeze. The tree is silent in the night, when the air is still and the stems curl up into themselves. But each morning, the light of Ara grows upon the horizon and awakens the breeze. You start to notice the sound, only it's been there for a while, and you can't place exactly when it began. By the time Ara is full, every leaf is perched and singing, their harmonies intertwined in unimaginable complexity.</em></p>

<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter1">Chapter 1</h2>
<p><em>It's quiet. Something is wrong.</em></p>
<p><em>No. It's fine. Just a little late.</em></p>
<p><em>It's never this late.</em></p>
<p>The wind picked up and Ara was warming the land, but still the ziyu tree remained silent. I took a deep breath and examined it, but nothing looked different: it was still the same tree I remembered my mother taking me to.</p>
<p><em>It must be the wind. The wind is too dry right now.</em></p>
<p>Patiently, I waited for an answer that would settle my mind, but none came. There would be no song today.</p>
<p>I stood up and dusted off my trousers, catching a last glimpse of the twilight-pink sky through the quiet leaves. I felt the presence of some malicious spirit, brooding within the very breeze I drew my breaths from.</p>
<p>"The wind speaks," my mother would say, "The ziyu tells us what it's saying."</p>
<p>"What is it saying?" I must have asked hae a thousand times. My mother would tell me to listen a little closer, that the answer was not something I could hear. I knew that the silence was an answer, but the trouble was in the question.</p>
<p>"Lovely morning, Liffa."</p>
<p>Startled, I sat up to see a silhouette of Melna standing in the light, her hair dancing in time with the leaves.</p>
<p>"How long have you been here?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Just a moment. I figured you would be here today."</p>
<p>I stayed silent, still listening for the leaves and my mother's voice.</p>
<p>"You've been gone a while. Breakfast is ready soon."</p>
<p>"I'll be there in a bit."</p>
<p>She stared at me for a moment, I assume to size up my strange behavior.</p>
<p>"There's a chill in the air," she remarked, "Don't stay out too long."</p>
<hr />
<p>Kipnu was at the stove reheating a sweet mash of pohua with his morning face on. His hair resembled the furrowed nest of a bird that took a liking to the most crooked of branches. He looked up, locking his tired eyes to mine, and put on his laziest morning smile which only complimented his hair. I walked up to hug and nuzzle him good morning. Melna was squatting at a table in the great room, reading her daily missive of provincial news.</p>
<p>"Anything new?", I asked her.</p>
<p>"Not particularly. We're still running our typical surplus of fruits. People always request more of them than they actually need."</p>
<p>Kipnu chortled, looking at me. "Liffa here could probably eat the entire surplus herself."</p>
<p>"Sweets are my one joy in life," I replied with a smile. "Shame will never keep me from my one true love. Anyway, all the farmers I know dry-preserve what they don't sell."</p>
<p>"I'll pretend I didn't hear that," said Melna.</p>
<p>I stirred at the table, and then rose again to go bother Kipnu who had fallen asleep at the stove. With a gentle nudge, I moved him away and removed the pot from the focal point.</p>
<p>"A leaf would be great," I told him as I fetched a spoon.</p>
<p>Melna walked over to us to check on the food. "Let me make sure it's still like my mother used to make," she took out a spoon and dipped it into the pot. "Too thick - add some water"</p>
<p>I pulled some water from the dew column at the center of the great room and returned to add it to the mix little by little, waiting for Melna's approval.</p>
<p>Finally, we sat down to eat.</p>
<p>A moment of quiet went by and I could see Melna's mind had moved onto a deeper thought. She released her pen and sat up in her chair, staring longingly out at the door. I could tell she was thinking about traveling again. The three of us had joined too early before we could roam across the world.</p>
<p>"It's been too long," she said with a longing tone.</p>
<p>Kipnu knew what she was thinking too. "Last time was when we went to the North coast to live with the Hunnin for a week," he said. "I'll never forget how cold that was. Who's idea was that again?" He never missed a chance to remind me.</p>
<p>I defended my choice, "Hey, we all had fun uh… catching fish."</p>
<p>Melna and Kipnu smiled, knowing what I really meant.</p>
<p>"There was nothing else to do," Kipnu said.</p>
<p>"Yea, but I'd still do it again."</p>
<p>And I would. Because I was happy when they were around.</p>
<p>It was the apart times, when the waves of loneliness washed upon the cracks of my heart. Those were the moments when I was keenly aware of how wholly incomplete I would always be.</p>
<hr />
<p>I entered the dressing room as Melna was putting on her fidelant attire so I could help her tie the knots of her complex robes. I spoke not with my tongues but with my the cold of my fingers.</p>
<p>She moved to the mirror and I followed her. The growing light of Ara had been shining through the window, and it bounced off the mirror and into my eyes as I walked toward it. I put my arm up to shield the light while she stood just barely in it.</p>
<p>She proceeded to wrap her cape around her shoulders and I took up the tying of her waistbelt behind her. The mauve color of Heiko shined proudly in the daylight. I remembered dying them in Pohua, taking every care to ensure that the dye was consistent and fast to the cloth, but still I saw all of its imperfections whenever I looked at it. Melna didn't seem to mind.</p>
<p>"This morning, you mentioned the cold air," I spoke hesitantly.</p>
<p>She didn't respond.</p>
<p>"The farmers have a responsibility, you know," I tried again to persuade her, "If a temperature drift is coming, we need to know so we aren't caught by an early-"</p>
<p>"Liffa… we've been over this. If I had evidence of drift, I would tell you."</p>
<p>She was a stone wall of secrets, and I was unsatisfied until I could break through. But it was unfair of me to keep pushing on it when I knew she was bound to her duties. I wasn't letting her go without a promise.</p>
<p>I placed a hand on her bare shoulder, and pleaded, "Look me in the eye. Look at me and tell me you are not keeping secrets from your village. From your bounds."</p>
<p>She looked at me through the mirror for a moment, searching for motives in an innocent face.</p>
<p>"I don't have time for this," she said coldly.</p>
<p>I let out a frustrated sigh and made my way to the doorway of her room.</p>
<p>Before I could leave, she said, "Liffa…"</p>
<p>I stopped without turning.</p>
<p>"You know I love you."</p>
<p>I left.</p>
<hr />
<p>Kipnu was going over his schedule of patients in the same spot we had left him. He looked up and took a glance at me, burying his head in the schedule again.</p>
<p>"Melna got you down?"</p>
<p>"How could you tell?"</p>
<p>"Ah you know."</p>
<p>I waited for him to elaborate.</p>
<p>"…Reasons."</p>
<p><em>Thanks Kip…</em></p>
<p>I mustered up a response, "Don't want to talk about it right now."</p>
<p>He wasn't convinced, but he was more accepting about these things than I was.</p>
<p>"Okay… suit yourself"</p>
<p>I stooped at the table with him and a long awkward silence filled the room while I watched him write notes in his schedule. Melna came downstairs and looked us over. She had a confused look for a brief moment, but resumed her departure.</p>
<p>"I'm headed to the train."</p>
<p>"Have a good day," he chimed. I stayed silent.</p>
<p>"I'll be back a bit late tonight. Don't wait up for me."</p>
<p>Late wasn't particularly rare for her, but I wanted to pry.</p>
<p>"Late? What for?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Yansha has been pushing us on this grain resolution."</p>
<p>I looked in her eyes more intently. Something about her eyes was very out of place. As if she had shut off her heart and it was wallowing in guilt. I stood up and approached her as she turned to leave the house.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" She asked. I checked that her cords were tight and robe was creased correctly.</p>
<p>"Whatever it is you'll be arguing today, I'm here for you."</p>
<p>I embraced her as if she was going on a long journey. She was never too fond of touch, but today she raised her arms to reciprocate.</p>
<p>"Thank you. Liffa."</p>
<p>Kipnu walked up to us, and she loosened up enough to hug the both of us before opening the door to the outside. He and I watched as she entered the daylight without looking back. Her assistant Pomri, and her saffa stood by along the parkway, looking as palatial as always. The two of them together always gave me an uneasy feeling.</p>
<p>"What's going on between you two?" Kipnu asked again.</p>
<p>I held my binding pendant tightly and remembered that marriage was full of difficulties.</p>
<p>"Nothing," I said. "Just a chill in the air."</p></div>

<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter2">Chapter 2</h2>
<p>Working in the field never felt lonely to me, though I knew some who resented it for that reason. My thoughts may betray me sometimes, but never out there. There was far too much to be done to have thoughts of other places and other times.</p>
<p>Every morning was a repeat of the same movements I had learned from countless mornings of dressing with my mother. I would descend to the cellar to dress for the long day of sowing or harvesting or maintenance. The smell of damp on the stone walls pervaded the air and reminded me that my mother was with me. I would hook a lightglass to the overhead electrical rails, and little by little the flow of electricity grew and warmed the metal ribbon inside to a bright white. Drying on a length of twine were a pair of canvas trousers, a thickly-woven tunic, and gloves stained with clay and chlorophyll. No matter how often I dirtied them or dinged them up, they withstood it all for thousands of days. I was certain that my mother knew how to make the most durable clothes of anyone in Heiko.</p>
<p>We used to grow Pohua, a hardy root vegetable known for its sweet and fruity taste. As a toddler, my mother would carry me in a big thatch bag on her back while thi tilled, planted, harvested. I watched hae hands unfold those tiny tubers across the clay and pack them in. At days end, I would gaze in awe of how much thi could plant and harvest. It's been sixty-five crop rotations since thi passed, but thi lives as vividly in my memories as thi did in life.</p>
<p>"I bet you'll plant 1000 today, Liffa," thi said once.</p>
<p>"2000!"</p>
<p>"Hohoho," thi laughed in the most graceful way. "2000 then."</p>
<p>My childhood attention span was not helpful, but thi was never disappointed in me as long as I was learning.</p>
<p>I lifted the light from the rails, set it in its corner, and took a last breath of the earthen basement air. The day was calling.</p>
<p>"Another day, then," called Tiggu as I walked the length of a plot of clay. She surprised me from behind the wide fence thi insisted on building.</p>
<p>"Is your life really so mundane that the days are all the same?" I asked jokingly.</p>
<p>"Oh, I enjoy the repetition. Can't get a body like this by talking to tie-backs all day."</p>
<p>"The fidelants play an important role in our society. Melna included."</p>
<p>"Ah. What good is a railroad and electricity? Doesn't help me harvest."</p>
<p>I changed the subject, "It's chilly today, isn't it?"</p>
<p>She stopped for a moment to think.</p>
<p>"I suppose so," she said. "Every rotation will have a few of these."</p>
<p>"Yes, but… Isn't it too early?”</p>
<p>"Oh you'll get them at all sorts of times. Once when I was young we had 4 days of frost right after germination of one plot. Lost the whole thing and had to start over. Ara is a fickle thing."</p>
<p>"That sounds unfortunate, but I think this one is different somehow. The wind is strange too, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"It's just a cold spell. These things happen. It'll be back to normal soon, you'll see."</p>
<p>"Sure. We'll see."</p>
<p>Her answer was unsatisfying, but I went back to working. Perhaps I was overreacting.</p>
<p>"So when are you three going to have children? It's been a while since you were joined."</p>
<p>"That's none of your business."</p>
<p>"I'm just looking out for you is all. When your legs grow weak and you can't bend down to harvest, you'll wish you had someone to take your place."</p>
<p>"I'll be just fine."</p>
<p>"Though, I wonder how you'll raise kids and crops at the same time. Takes a different sort of mother. A nather like me would harvest a whole plot in the morning and birth a kid in the evening."</p>
<p><em>I doubt that.</em></p>
<p>"Like I said, I'll be fine."</p>
<p>The things she said were nothing new, though they always bothered me more than they ought to have. We worked side-by-side in silence for a bit, and then she began again.</p>
<p>"How are Melna and Kipnu doing anyway? Any new stories for an old lady?"</p>
<p>"They are fine."</p>
<p>"That's all? Just fine?"</p>
<p>I snapped, "What do want from me, woman?"</p>
<p>"Mind yourself, Liffa. What sort of Maman raises hae voice to an elder?"</p>
<p>I was at the edge of my frustration.</p>
<p>"They're doing just fine, okay? Kipnu is having a great start at the clinic, and Melna is representing this village to the council. Is that what you're looking for?"</p>
<p>She sughed, went quiet, and resumed her work while I stared at her indignantly.</p>
<p>"A jealous Maman never rests," she said out of nowhere.</p>
<p>I jabbed my shovel into the clay and stopped myself from yelling something I would regret later.</p>
<p><em>That's enough for now</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>There was a sense of humility or perhaps a feeling of unimportance as I returned home. I didn't blame Tiggu for her perspective. She was born of the same caste my parents came from; taught to accept their roles in life as farmers or parents. If they tried to do something else with their life, they would be met with endless criticism from their family for burdening everyone with their risks. I like to imagine that Tiggu tried to branch out once, but would never admit it. Perhaps she was making sure that I wouldn't make her mistakes.</p>
<p>I took my boots and trousers off and left them next to the door, where the clay from countless planting days had painted a spot on the mossy pathway, and fled immediately to the dew column at the center of our home. My scent glands picked up the aroma of the anomin plants I had been cultivating in my room. They led me in, as if expecting me to return. With a sigh, I took it all in as if seeing it for the first time: my small cup collection, the hang drying pohua, my mother's dusty old lanterns, and the anomin filling the air with its resins and oils. But still I was unsettled. As with all things in my life, it felt temporary. Like some fantastic dream that I would one day be awoken from, abruptly and without warning.</p>
<p><em>Do I deserve to be here? I'm not saving lives or making big decisions.</em></p>
<p><em>But I still contribute pohua to the village. I make sure we have food and water and a functional home.</em></p>
<p><em>"A jealous Maman never rests"</em></p>
<p><em>Tiggu… What did Mamen ever do to offend you?</em></p>
<p><em>Or was I the rude one? No, She was intentionally trying to get under my skin.</em></p>
<p><em>I feel guilty. Why do I feel guilty? What sort of corruption has this old woman woven into my heart?</em>.</p>
<p>It felt unclean, like I needed to burn away some piece of myself that had spoiled, to protect my homeland from myself.</p>
<p><em>No, I am self-dependent. That is who I am. That is what makes me worthy of living.</em></p>
<p>I laid down on my bed and let my thoughts drift back to childhood. My father used to tell me, "Nothing is promised in life. Even your mind can betray you". And my nather would always remind him, "You promised to love us".</p>
<p>There was a knock at the front door to snap me awake. <em>Is it that Tiggu again come to tell me I was rude?</em></p>
<p>I sat up on my bed and quietly snuck toward the door to see who it was.</p>
<p><em>Jathi? Delivering a message now? What could he possibly want?</em></p>
<p>I cracked the door to talk to him, but before I could say anything he unleashed a flurry of desperate words.</p>
<p>“Liffa, I have an urgent message for Melna. Is she here?”</p>
<p>“Um. No she left a bit ago.”</p>
<p>He was still catching his breath, “We - we need to find a way to get it to her as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“Slow down, Jathi. What’s this about?”</p>
<p>“It's about Ara.“</p></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter3">Chapter 3</h2>
<p>"Ara? Why would Melna need to know about that?"</p>
<p>"The observers on Falni Peak are doing some study about the stellar surface and they said they've found something big and need to tell the senate right away"</p>
<p><em>She's keeping a secret</em></p>
<p>"Well, if she's not here, I should go back to call the capital."</p>
<p>"Wait. Let me go with you."</p>
<p>"Oh that's really not necessary -"</p>
<p>"I need to know more; I won't slow you down" I plead to him while I ran off to fetch a new pair of trousers as quickly as I could.</p>
<p>The late morning light was just enough for me to see while I dashed to the stable to get Laen-Laen, our Saffa. He was small for a Saffa, but at twelve times my own weight, he was more than enough to fit Jathi and me.</p>
<p>"Laen-Laen, good morning!"</p>
<p>He gave out a whoop as he woke up from his half-nap.</p>
<p>"You're still asleep, Laen?"</p>
<p>A loud "Ooo" sound filled the room as he stood up and yawned in my face.</p>
<p>"Hey grass-breath, can you take me to Heiko central?"</p>
<p>He snorted his disapproval with his fuzzy ears turned backward.</p>
<p>"We can stop by Gilli's and get a cake."</p>
<p>"Woop woop woop!" He said as he perked up and twisted his head left and right.</p>
<p>"There we go. Now lets get you ready."</p>
<p>I took a soft linen blanket from the wall and paused a moment to remember when Jathi and I used to walk with a younger Laen along the foggy coastline in the mornings. The three of us would play hide and seek on a wide open beach and just get lost shouting to each other in the gray abyss until the fog lifted.</p>
<p><em>Not the time for memories</em>. I snapped out and hopped on while rushing to the front gate where Jathi was waiting for me.</p>
<p>"Didn't think we would be doing this again, " he said.</p>
<p>"Never thought we would be delivering a message to the senate."</p>
<p>"There's always something new with you, Liffa."</p>
<hr />
<p>The winds were slowly picking up while we rode down the long, sintered-clay path from my home toward the center of town. The perfect ring shape of the crown of Palinan was splitting the sky in two. The white light of Ara and its golden splendor was to our right and Ulu, the darkness, was to our left. Whispy clouds hung high in the sky, reaching across the crown of twilight to enter into that dark abyss.</p>
<p>I wondered what was happening to Ara. As a child, I learned that the observers had found that Palinan was orbiting Ara in a big ellipse, which gives us the bright and dim times. They also knew that there were other, much redder stars very far away. Exactly how far, they couldn't be certain, but they were much too far to reach in our lifetimes. Even with the fastest vehicles.</p>
<p>I wondered if the stars could die like we did, or if they had always been there, like holes in the firmament.</p>
<p>At the end of the path, we turned a corner and crossed the train line just after the station, onto a side street into town. It was rather peaceful, as the first meal time had just passed into rest time. We reached the conduit office and quickly hopped off of Laen. I gave him a thankful pat on the neck and he gave me back a small woop of acknowledgement.</p>
<p>When I entered, an old man who seemed to know Jathi was already inside, standing by the doorway.</p>
<p>"Aey, lad," he said, "You forgot to clean the lenses. And weren't you supposed to be looking for Melna?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Thimlu. There's been a bit of a snag. Melna's already left."</p>
<p>"Well that's not good. 's not good at all."</p>
<p>"Have you reached any of the other observatories?"</p>
<p>"The only other two are in Holrag. And they're both unresponsive. Kantha really should be picking up. He knows about this."</p>
<p>"No worries," Jathi said with a chipper voice. "I'll try Melna's personal line."</p>
<p>Jathi set himself at the phone desk and attempted to reach the court. There was no space for two people at the desk, so I stayed standing closer to the door. The ceiling was a towering, ordered nest of small rails to different homes within Heiko. There was a big rail, which I assume went to Shaki.</p>
<p>"Shaki Conduit, This is Heiko Conduit."</p>
<p>Another caller delivered a message, but none from Shaki. He waited a tick and then repeated.</p>
<p>"Shaki Conduit, This is -"</p>
<p>"Heiko, this is Shaki. Please remember to speak in your turn."</p>
<p>"Shaki, we are requesting priority. This is an urgent call to the Senate."</p>
<p>There was silence for a moment as all of the operators paused to listen in.</p>
<p>"Heiko, which conduit in the senate are you requesting connection to?"</p>
<p>"The Heiko fidelant's private conduit, please."</p>
<p>The conduit operator paused.</p>
<p>"Heiko, I assume you have a damn good reason for that."</p>
<p>"Yes, I do. It's a message pertaining to today's assembly."</p>
<p>He paused and sighed.</p>
<p>"Transferring you to Heiko Senate. Please wait a moment."</p>
<p>I took the moment of silence to shift to a chair and sit down close to Jathi. He opened the message and flattened it on the table, memorizing the pronunciation of the more technical words. I glanced at it but couldn't read the writing from my distance. There was a scribbled drawing of a circle and some dots on it, but I couldn't make out what they were.</p>
<p>Thimlu interrupted me, "I remember you from orbital. Couldn't teach Jathi a damn thing until you left. Why couldn't you two find a nice woman and settle down?"</p>
<p>Jathi's cheeks went red, and he protested, "Thimlu! You can't say something lke that."</p>
<p>"Bah. Observers are sworn to observe, and this one's pretty clear."</p>
<p>The line opened and an unenthused maman spoke, "Conduit of the Heiko Senate, Assistant Pomri."</p>
<p>"Pomri, I have an urgent message for Melna."</p>
<p>"Jathi? By Ara, don't you ever sleep? It's the middle of first nap."</p>
<p>"What we've found at the observatory was too important to nap on."</p>
<p>She sighed, "Well, I'm afraid you're too late. Melna is currently in assembly."</p>
<p>"When will she be out?"</p>
<p>"It can last anywhere from 2 tova'na to the whole day."</p>
<p>"This message is of utmost importance. It will likely affect today's deliberations. Is there any way you can tell her?"</p>
<p>"It's unlawful to interrupt the assembly."</p>
<p>"Surely you can make an exception."</p>
<p>"And I would surely be imprisoned for it."</p>
<p>He sighed in frustration burying his eyes in his hand.</p>
<p>"Pomri," he replied with pessimism. "You can't be serious. Even if there is a law against interrupting the assembly, a magistrate would look the other way at sentencing."</p>
<p>"You ever been to Shaki?"</p>
<p>He hesitated, "Well, no but –"</p>
<p>"– Something to learn before you come. Magistrates get off on being right even if they're wrong. Just wait until the assembly is done."</p>
<p>"But… we can't wait the entire day."</p>
<p>"Look, it sounds like this is really important. Why don't you come to Shaki and we can talk it over?"</p>
<p>"You're asking us to come to the senate? So one of us can do it instead of you?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I can't do more, kid. Laws here are really backward but at least I can grumble about 'em. Just think about what I said."</p>
<p>He sighed, "Yea. We- I'll consider it," he said.</p>
<p>"Thanks," she said, and the line went silent.</p>
<p>I built some resolve and double checked that the microphone was off.</p>
<p>"I'll go," I said.</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"I'll interrupt the Senate"</p>
<p>"That's crazy. You heard Pomri. You'll be sent to Ulukoma."</p>
<p>Thimlu butted in. "This is of utmost importance," he said with a smirk on his face. "A magistrate would surely look the other way at sentencing."</p>
<p>Jathi shouted back at him, "Whose side are you on here?!"</p>
<p>I was astonished. Jathi was always so calm and now he was the most animated I had ever seen him. He sighed and sat back, turning it over in his head. I rose from the desk and paced the floor across from him, pausing to admire the old wood floor that countless messengers before him had walked upon.</p>
<p>I tried to convince him again, "I can't think of any better way to do it."</p>
<p>"You are sacrificing too much. The bureaucracy behind the court is impossible."</p>
<p>"It's a sacrifice I'm willing for Liffa to take," said Thimlu. He took the words right out of my mouth.</p>
<p>I explained my thoughts. "One of us has to do it. If this is as important as you say, then there will be a lot of chatter for the next few days. One of you has to keep the communication lines open amidst all that chaos, and one of you has to keep watching the sky for more data. Besides, I have some strings I can pull at the senate. I stand a much better chance."</p>
<p>Jathi seemed defeated but he looked up into my eyes and we locked gazes for a while.</p>
<p>"If you pull this off, I'll petition the magistrate for a lighter sentence."</p>
<p>"Don't worry about me," I told him. "I've got a coat."</p>
<p>I gathered my bag onto my shoulders, and stood near the doorway as they looked on.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen. I've an errand to run and then I'll be on my way to Shaki. Thank you for entrusting me with this mission. I won't let you down."</p>
<p>"Good luck, Liffa," said Jathi, somberly.</p>
<p>"Don't get yourself killed," said Thimlu.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Aey? Kipnu?" I called as I entered the clinic. He chirped sleepily from a back room and I followed the call. I came to the doorway and watched him for a moment. His sleepy face always made me swoon no matter how silly it looked.</p>
<p>"Hey," I interrupted myself, "I'm sorry to wake you but I need to talk."</p>
<p>He shuffled around the cot, looking confused, then looked up at my shadow in the doorway.</p>
<p>"Liffa, that you?"</p>
<p>He pushed himself up and took a moment to wake up. Then he pulled a lightglass from his pocket and slid it onto the power rails above him. His sleepy eyes were still partially covered by his eyehaw.</p>
<p>"You surprised me. What brings you here?"</p>
<p>"I'm going on a trip to the capital."</p>
<p>"What? Why?" He asked, his eyes now completely open.</p>
<p>"It's just something between Melna and me"</p>
<p>"You're going all the way to the capital to settle an argument? Why can't you wait until she comes back?"</p>
<p>"It's… a long story"</p>
<p>"You mean you don't want to tell me"</p>
<p>I paused, dumbstruck and scrambling for words.</p>
<p>"You're keeping a secret. Tell me what's going on-"</p>
<p>I backed away and stammered, "I'll tell you later. Take care of Laen-Laen, he'll be coming back home."</p>
<p>I turned to walk out the door, but he grabbed my wrist to stop me. His eyes were pleading, worried.</p>
<p>"We swore the Oath of Trust to each other," he reminded me. "Whatever is going on between you affects me as well."</p>
<p>"You can't be involved."</p>
<p>"I already am."</p>
<p>I fought off his grip, and stood just outside the door, staring at the gaudy iron floor of his office and vying with my own thoughts.</p>
<p><em>I could run now. I wanted to run. I had this all planned out. I would deliver the message, then survive Ulukoma and come back redeemed. Kipnu and Melna would understand. In the worst case, I would get a little cold in the dark. But Kipnu? I would have to fend for him too. He doesn't know how to survive on the land</em></p>
<p>He pushed again, "If you won't tell me, then I'm going with you to find out myself."</p>
<p>"You couldn't - you have patients to see"</p>
<p>"They can wait."</p>
<p>"Kipnu-"</p>
<p>"Why can't you let me in?"</p>
<p>"Kipnu…if you go with me, it will be a long time before you come back."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? The trains run four times a day."</p>
<p>"This isn't about the trains, ok? I'm going on this journey alone and it might be a while before I come back."</p>
<p>"Stop being cryptic. What are you planning, Liffa?"</p>
<p>His gaze cast doubt on my resolve. How easy it would have been to say yes; to have him next to me while I interrupted a room full of intellectuals about some important science I didn't understand. To know that I wasn't alone in thinking this was the right thing.</p>
<p>No. His guilt would be my guilt. He can't be involved in this.</p>
<p><em>It's clear.</em></p>
<p>"Goodbye," I said.</p>
<p>I hopped onto Laen and didn't look back.</p></div>

<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter4">Chapter 4</h2>
<p>The station was just filling up for the next train after the day's first nap. The warm and sweet aroma of freshly-baked handcakes caressed my nose and pulled me closer to Gilli's bakery at the far corner of the station. I figured that I'd earned something nice, so I turned to let my nose take me closer. But Laen had been waiting for his moment, and he bolted toward the bakery as soon as he saw me stop.</p>
<p>"Laen!" I yelled at him. If I'm being honest, I wanted to get mine first.</p>
<p>I caught up to him as he was begging Gilli for a cake.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Gilli. I promised him I would get him one."</p>
<p>She laughed and said, "Oh it's alright. Everyone in Heiko deserves a cake, even saffas. Here!"</p>
<p>She tossed a roasted tor-nut handcake into the air and Laen caught it with his mouth with impeccable precision.</p>
<p>"Could I bother you for another for myself?"</p>
<p>"Just keep those Pohua shipments coming in," she said, and handed me one of the same kind.</p>
<p>I reached out to take it, but she didn't let go.</p>
<p>"I mean it," she said under her breath, "I need more. That last shipment you gave me was fantastic. It makes a better syrup than idze."</p>
<p>I looked at her and smiled uncomfortably, slightly intimidated, "Y-yea… I'll… See what I can do."</p>
<p>Her smile returned, and she said, "Thank you, Liffa… Next!"</p>
<p>I took one bite and tasted the juicy sweetness. She wasn't wrong. They had gotten better than I remembered them being. But then a dark shadow came over my hand and swooped down to steal my cake.</p>
<p>"Laen! That was mine!" I yelled, and gave him a slap on the shoulder. He barely noticed through his chewing.</p>
<p>"Once you're done, go back home ok?"</p>
<p>He didn't respond, but I knew he'd heard me. I left him in at the corner, humming with his stolen cake and a handful of water from my canteen, and made my way to the platform.</p>
<p>My feet found some rest squatting and leaning against a tree near the tracks, hiding from the wind and from Kipnu if he had decided to follow me. <em>This is the right thing</em>, I affirmed to myself. <em>No externalities. No liabilities</em>. I thought about the crops I had just planted. Whether Melna would ask Tiggu to work on them. Whether she would kill them out of spite, or replant them in her own field. If this is as important as Jathi said, then those crops don't matter in the scheme of things. Heiko would understand.</p>
<p>The station attendant called for us through a flathorn, "Train to Shaki approaching. All passengers prepare to marshal."</p>
<p>I quickly picked up my bag and jumped the wall to the marshalling side. The attendant was tall for a Maman with a recent flow tattoo mutating into hundreds of threads of infrared across hae neck. I admired it from afar as I shifted into the line for the 9th car. I had gotten a flow tattoo once, but working in the constant light of Ara made my skin's water vessels flow too quickly, so it all mixed together and just looked like I had some weird genetic defect in my hydroderm. My parents just laughed and told me about how they had tried it too when they were kids, and had the same results.</p>
<p>The train came rumbling in with its engines and brakes humming with electrical blood. Thi called again, "Train to Shaki. Stops in Rudjan Ara, Rudjan Ulu, Yansha, Shaki Harbor, Shaki Central."</p>
<p>The crowd fell into a tighter line against the wall, itching to find a decent place to sit.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, would you help me get in?"</p>
<p>Behind me was a older man with a polished steel cane that he was leaning on heavily. He looked up to me with a smile that I had to return, and I leant my hand to him to climb the steps into the carriage.</p>
<p>"Thank you, my kaln," he said.</p>
<p>I laughed, "I haven't been called a kaln in ages."</p>
<p>"Oh, at my age, everyone is a youngling."</p>
<p><em>I suppose that's true.</em></p>
<p>The seats were mostly empty but I took one across the carriage from the man - far enough not to creep him out - and put my bag down in the next seat. The sun and wind had grown to its mid-day peak, but the reinforced curtains made them both much more pleasant for a long ride. The man was finding a good spot for his legs as the seats weren't exactly spacious enough for an extended leg, but he eventually settled on a position.</p>
<p>"In all my years of riding trains, they've never built at least one spacious seat for people of my condition."</p>
<p>"Maybe none of them are living with your problem," I said.</p>
<p>"A sliver of empathy from them and an old man could sit in peace. Instead, a patient sweet maman like you has to bear my complaints."</p>
<p>"Charming a young maman? At your age?"</p>
<p>"I'm often told that I say too much of what I mean. Some may consider it charming, I suppose."</p>
<p>"Well, I believe that too many of my generation are afraid to speak, so I'm glad you're around to set us straight."</p>
<p>He chortled, "Charming an old man. At your age?"</p>
<p>I laughed. It was loud and it was awkward, but I knew he wouldn't mind.</p>
<p>He began again, "so what's taking you to the capital?"</p>
<p>I froze a bit, stuttering, but said "My jundwoman works there. Just bringing her something."</p>
<p>"Ahh. Surprising your jundwoman. I bet she'll be excited," he said.</p>
<p>"Heh. Yea. I hope she receives it well."</p>
<p>"A good jundwoman would be happy that you thought to brighten her day like that."</p>
<p>"Well we haven't been too happy with each other lately, so I hope you're right."</p>
<p>"Yes, that will happen from time to time. I still remember once, my spouses and I were fighting about a color for our daughter's first sleeping rug. We never even asked her what she wanted; we were too obsessed with winning the fight. For weeks, It was like an obsession or a fever. We didn't speak, we didn't eat together. But then one day," he snapped the air with his fingers.</p>
<p>"… what?" I asked. "One day, what?"</p>
<p>"The fever is gone. And insignificant."</p>
<p>"Did you ever have a fight that didn't stop?"</p>
<p>He paused and looked at me as if he had seen a younger version of himself in me.</p>
<p>"…Perhaps we should stop now."</p>
<p>"I don't mean to pry. It's just… if you have any advice, it would be greatly appreciated."</p>
<p>"Can't you ask your parents for advice? I don't like to get into family squabbles like this."</p>
<p>"My mother died right before I got married. My father and nather… were never really present." I said. I hoped that opening up to him would make him do the same.</p>
<p>"Oh no. That's terrible…" He said, visibly uncomfortable. "Well you did a splendid job raising yourself. Must be those child-rearing instincts you maman have that got you through it."</p>
<p>"They aren't instincts. We learn them just like any other skill."</p>
<p>"Oh but you're all so good at it."</p>
<p>"We spend a lot of time doing it. If men and women helped us, they'd be great at it too," I retorted.</p>
<p>He sighed, "We all have a place in society."</p>
<p>I turned forward and stopped talking before I said something I would regret. He returned his head back to the curtain, staring between stitches at the bright void of Ara. Like a switch, we returned to being strangers on the train.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Shaki Harbor! Approaching Shaki Harbor!" The conductor barreled in and blurted into the car. I pulled over both of my eyelids and rejoined reality.</p>
<p>"Shaki Harbor! Approaching Sha-," He repeated to the next car as the door closed behind him. <em>Shaki Harbor? I must have been out for a while.</em> I sat upright and glanced at the older man in the next seat, sleeping with his leg on the seat across. He looked as sound as a rock. I turned to the outside, facing a screen that blasted an earthen air from a dark, infrared landscape. I could make out some trees amongst the semi-arid hills and houses ambling in the distance. <em>All of this place. The trees, the animals, the people. Everywhere I've ever been could freeze over in a dim light because of some change in the white dot on the horizon.</em> I shuddered thinking about what Palinan might feel like if that happened.</p>
<p>The train slowed to a stop and opened its doors, but again only a few people boarded. The roll had not sustained me, and I was really craving a real meal. <em>Perhaps I ought to treat myself to something nice in the capital before I get banished to the wilderness… No… I don't have time for that.</em></p>
<p>I took out the letter to review it and think about how I might deliver it. The letter was marred with creases from all the travel, but luckily the fibers and the ink held up. I saw the dots and the circle again, but now I could make out the sentences.</p>
<pre><code>Obscura Observation
Melna,

I am following up on our conversations about colder temperatures in Heiko and other western sectors. After 20 Tova of observation of Ara, we have measured no measured reduction in stellar activity and no change in stellar size. However, we did detect a decrease in incident light. This is likely caused by a large diffuse obstruction made up of smaller objects. For brevity, we will call this collection "the obscura". It is difficult to estimate the size of each object, but they seem to span the entire view we have of Ara. Upon closer observation, we conclude that they are unlikely to be caused by a natural phenomenon as the obstructions seem to be growing in number and are moving in tandem so to be evenly-spaced.

If left alone, we calculate that the obscura will cause colder temperatures, weaker winds, and decreased precipitation, which will lead to most seasonal crops to become dormant in six days. In ten days, the temperatures and incident light will be low enough to freeze and kill all known crops. We advise immediate action to clear the obstruction. We will continue to monitor and update you everyday, and would appreciate your advice on how we can communicate more efficiently in this time.

- Jathi

<p>"What is this??" I murmured out loud, then glanced over at the old man to make sure he was still sleeping. I could feel my skin getting wet and cold in anxiety. <em>Kipnu… Melna… what will happen to them? Our home. The garden… And how will the senate receive this? They would dismiss me as a lunatic if I interrupt them for something this outlandish. If I get sent to Ulukoma, while they prepare for the cold, what will I come back to?</em> It was too much to think of. I closed my eyes, and I rode the waves of anxiety back down. <em>I must deliver this message. I can think about the future later. For now, I'm doing the right thing for all of Palinan and that's all I need.</em> I folded up the letter and put it back in my bag, returning my thoughts to my head and my gaze toward the vast darkness of Ulu.</p>
<p>"You look like you've seen something you'd rather not have," said the man, startling me.</p>
<p>I shot my eyes toward his, gray, washed-out.</p>
<p>"Pardon?" I jabbed. I was at the edge of my day's limit for politeness.</p>
<p>He chuckled, "Kipnu told me you were just like Melna. You're far worse."</p>
<p>"Do you have something to say to me?"</p>
<p>"He also told me what you're trying to do. I must say, I was a bit annoyed when I had to reschedule my appointment with him."</p>
<p><em>Damn it, Kipnu.</em></p>
<p>I snapped back, "And you intend to stop me with that leg of yours?"</p>
<p>"Oh, on the contrary. I intend to help you."</p>
<p>"Help me? Why?"</p>
<p>"My name is Fajro. I used to be a senior Holragi fidelant at the senate back when your bundwoman, Melna, was just getting started there. She was a real firebrand when she started. Her words had a sort of spice, and I knew it very well."</p>
<p>I didn't appreciate his tone.</p>
<p>"You haven't answered my question."</p>
<p>"Patience, kaln, I'm getting there," he retorted gently and adjusted his seat. "Let's just say I owe her a favor long past due, and I consider this gesture a part of the repayment. Whatever was on that paper of yours, it must be important enough that you're willing to risk the frozen badlands for it."</p>
<p>"I assure you it is."</p>
<p>"Good. You wouldn't dare waste my time traveling in this uncomfortable train for nothing."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't dare," I said in a tone so enrobed in sweetness that I had nearly forgotten the pit in my stomach where cake was supposed to be.</p>
<p>"So, let's get down to details. I can get you into the senate, and put the guards at ease, but I will not follow you in or introduce you. I'm not getting wrapped up in this."</p>
<p>"Wait, wait. I never said I was barging into the senate?"</p>
<p>"Why else would you be traveling there alone?"</p>
<p>He had my entire plan figured out. How?</p>
<p>"You would be a tremendous help in vouching for me."</p>
<p>"Ah… but I really wouldn't"</p>
<p>"But you were a fidelant."</p>
<p>"I was…" he said . "I didn't exactly leave on the best terms."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"There were some fidelants that I didn't exactly see eye-to-eye with. And we would often resort to…vulgarities to express our disdain for each other."</p>
<p>"So? People shout at each other all the time."</p>
<p>"Has Melna never told you what the Senate's laws are like? They were written by religious fanatics hundreds of ma'tova ago. Any sort of shouting or vulgarity is considered a 'corruption of consciousness' and isn't tolerated. Needless to say, they had to let me go."</p>
<p>"Why you and not the others?"</p>
<p>"The tribes of Holrag were insignificant members of the unification treaty. The city-states of the east.. well they played a bigger role."</p>
<p>"That's ridiculous."</p>
<p>"That's politics."</p>
<p>I was silently furious at how unjust the Senate could be, but took it as a lesson on how not to argue with the fidelants.</p>
<p>Fajro began again, "So the next hurdle you will face is that the mediator will try to shut you up. That microphone can be surprisingly loud."</p>
<p>"I'll just talk louder."</p>
<p>He chuckled at my idea, "Well, there's another way. You can use someone else's microphone."</p>
<p>"That sounds…difficult."</p>
<p>"Ordinarily, yes. But you have someone on your side already in there."</p>
<p><em>Melna</em>. "No…I couldn't. I would tarnish her reputation forever."</p>
<p>"How important is this discovery?"</p>
<p>I thought about how Melna might react. She would be furious no matter what I did. Her reputation in the senate would be forever tied to me, but if the observers are right, then we would be remembered in a positive light.</p>
<p>He continued, "A normal person would have difficulties at every turn doing what you want to do. But you… you have us."</p>
<p>I stared at the thatched seat in front of me. I imagined Melna there, comforting me, inviting me to speak to the senate. It all felt unnatural, forced. She didn't trust me. I was a just some farmer she fell in love with once.</p>
<p>One day, she would understand.</p>
<p>The Conductor called out "Shaki Central! Last stop, everyone off!"</p>
<p>"Would you help a cripple?" He asked me with a smirk. I smiled back and held out my arm.</p></div>

<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter5">Chapter 5</h2>
<p>The city was carved from the body of an old mountain, curled upward as if the land itself was an ocean wave. Massive veins of white marble meandered between gray, banded rock, and striped through the roads and walls like an unmoving spectre casting shadows through time. Every building faced proudly toward Ara, carefully reflecting every glint of orange and red and infrared. High upon the mountain within the largest vein of marble sat the senate, with its crown, a the gilded halo of the Palinian circle. I imagined being one of the people that carved out their piece of the mountain to call home. <em>It must have taken ages</em>.</p>
<p>"Been a while, has it?" Fajro said once we got off.</p>
<p>"Yes. At least a few ma'tova."</p>
<p>"The beauty of this place never changes. In Holrag, we call this place "The diamond of Palinan."</p>
<p>"Even after years of coming here, it hasn't lost its luster?"</p>
<p>"Every time, it seems like a distant memory. This city changes you the minute you join the throng. Every day here is another lifetime."</p>
<p>"Let's make this one count."</p>
<p>The base of the city was brightly lit, but there were large spots of shade behind giant curved mirrors in the distance. They were continuously focusing and harvesting Ara's light onto pipes of water to deliver steam to all of Shaki. Near the railyard an air of bustle filled the area with hordes of trainferriers bringing cargo to and from the trains; trade scribes in toe trying to keep up. Their heads would occasionally turn toward a place settled the desert, visible to all the city. A thin tower showed two sets of shadowed vertical lines against the bright light.</p>
<p><em>The timekeeper. I remember now.</em></p>
<p>I helped Fajro walk from the railyard to the easternmost funicular station. It was not terribly distant, but the sluggish pace was wearing thin on the patience of passersby trying to get around us.</p>
<p>"I regret that I am slowing you down," he said, acknowledging his frustration.</p>
<p>"No such talk. These people can afford to slow down a little bit."</p>
<p>"You know, I used to keep pace with the trainferriers before I busted my knee."</p>
<p>"Oh I bet you could run circles around them," I said, trying to lift his spirits a bit.</p>
<p>We rode the funicular up the mountain and toward the Senate. It made several stops along the way, giving us places to stop and marvel at the beauty of the city from above. The public workers with their dusty canvas tunics, the scribes with their ink-blotted fingers, all funneling in and out of the car. Some were carrying their afternoon meal with them as if they had no time to eat, and it made me terribly hungry, despite my anxiety. Compartmentalizing everything I felt was no small feat, but there wasn't much of a choice. This had to be done. We had to prepare for what was to come.</p>
<p>"Senate. Last stop," called the operator.</p>
<p>I helped him off and he took a seat on the first bench he could find to rest his legs. It was a small public square directly in front of the senate building.</p>
<p>"Ah this brings me back. You see that gate? I used to walk through it every day. I would always round the left corner as I entered from the west. And the steam fountain - Oh I loved to perch on the side of that thing and rake my fingers through the cool mist."</p>
<p>"You sound very fond of this place."</p>
<p>"You could say that. Almost all of my waking life was devoted to the people here. It really made an impression on me."</p>
<p>"Do you ever miss it?"</p>
<p>"Some parts. I felt proud of myself, and all the work that we put in to make big advancements. You know, I played a big part in the unification pact in Holrag."</p>
<p>"You?"</p>
<p>"I brokered a treaty for the tribes of Holragi to work together. The pact helped us become the manufacturing giant we are today, and deployed hundreds of public workers to design and survey the space rail."</p>
<p>"You must be proud," I said, not really caring.</p>
<p>"It would be a sin not to be proud. Alas, the scientists who headed the program won't allow me that privelege. They wanted to expand the observer program; to send explorers with telescopes into space to see what we cannot from the surface. By the end, we had only built the rail to half the length we needed, so it was only long enough to send lightweight things into orbit. Even the smallest craft they wanted to send would be too heavy."</p>
<p>"Ideas never make it to reality unscathed," I said. "I learned that one early."</p>
<p>"I suppose," he said, unconvinced. He feigned agreement with a nod.</p>
<p>After a moment wrapping up his thoughts, he put his hands on the bench, "Well, shall we?"</p>
<hr />
<p>The front gateway was a massive arch built into the five-story building and nearly half the height. The edges were trimmed with two forged iron columns, branching and twisting elegantly into ornate patterns that cast floral shadows against the marble. I felt my jaw tensing up, and my belly was in knots, but I reminded myself of the note, of Thimlu, and of the Throngia who were counting on me. Turning back was not an option.</p>
<p>We approached the base of the gateway where a male and female guard in woven stranded-steel armor stood in front. "Name and business," the female guard requested in an uninterested tone.</p>
<p>Fajro began, "I am Fajro, retired fidelant of Holrag. I have been summoned to deliver a message to the Heiko fidelant that is vital to their deliberations today."</p>
<p>"No one is permitted in the Senate while they are deliberating."</p>
<p>"Yes, I understand. I am delivering it to her assistant."</p>
<p>"She hasn't mentioned this to us."</p>
<p>"Yes. I was summoned by the speaker, as the matter is unexpected and urgent."</p>
<p>She deliberated with her partner, and glanced at me once, sending a shock of worry through my bones. I was getting cold again.</p>
<p>"You are permitted to go, but your attendant cannot come with you."</p>
<p><em>NO</em></p>
<p>He replied, "My… attendant helps me walk on account of my injured knee. I can't go anywhere without help these days."</p>
<p>The male guard begrudgingly walked over to me and said, "Open your bag."</p>
<p>I complied and he rummaged for a bit before walking back and giving a hand sign to the other guard. She said, "Go ahead."</p>
<p>The senate grounds were surrounded by the building that the rest of the city called the Senate. It was a massive circle of offices and gates and walkway, its diameter as large as the farmland I worked in Heiko. But the true focus of this place was the deliberation hall: a giant marble sphere standing proudly in the center, illuminated by the light through Ara's gate. It sat upon a short marble pedastal that seemed too small to be holding so much weight. Between the outer circle and the sphere was a labyrinth of small pools and lines of vegetation that could certainly not live in such a hot and dry place without the constant shade that the perimeter circle granted. At every vertex of the planting lines, a small black iron circle with an engraved crest marked a city that was member to the Shaki Senate. I longed to venture through the plants and learn about them, but I dared not draw attention to myself.</p>
<p>Fajro set me back on track, "Perhaps it's best that we head towards the Heiko office so as not to seem suspicious. We'll want to enter through that side anyway."</p>
<p>I remained silent and compliant, too nervous to say anything. We followed the inside of the perimeter circle to the right into the Heiko section, and turned the corner to face the deliberation hall. It was more shaded from this side, but still as radiant as the rest of the city. There were two guards at the doors again with the same woven armor and massive rectangular shields built to repel several people at once.</p>
<p>"How can we get through them?" I asked, feeling doubtful.</p>
<p>"Leave that to me. This is why Kipnu sent me after all. I'll distract them while you go around and slip through the door."</p>
<p>A pang of anger welled up in me but I kept my eyes faced forward, "What sort of plan is that?"</p>
<p>"Oh I think you'll find I can be very distracting."</p>
<p>"Anyone can be distracting. You're a fidelant. Why not use that to get me in?"</p>
<p>"The power of law lies in its enforcement. And trust me when I say these guards know enforcement. Not even I can wrest them from their duty to the law."</p>
<p>"Noble. But annoying."</p>
<p>I began to relish in Fajro's slow walking speed, imagining how I might slip by them unnoticed. It seemed impossible but for my shorter stature. There are some perks to being a Maman.</p>
<p>"What shall I do if they notice me?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Keep going. You'll be imprisoned either way."</p>
<p>"That's great to know."</p>
<p>At about ten paces away from the guards one of them called out, "The Deliberation Hall is closed. Turn around."</p>
<p>Fajro didn't stop and kept eye contact with them while they approached. I fell behind a bit, hiding behind him. <em>What was he going to do?</em></p>
<p>The guard called out again, "You two, turn around and go back where you came from!"</p>
<p>Fajro responded to him confidently, "Tinpo, it's been a while, hasn't it."</p>
<p>"I'm not telling you again. Turn back."</p>
<p>"What sort of welcome is this? You don't recognize your uncle anymore?"</p>
<p>"… Fajro? What are you doing here?" The guard called out and stopped.</p>
<p><em>The guard is his nephew?!</em></p>
<p>Fajro stopped in front of Tinpo and looked him up and down.</p>
<p>"Tinpo, you make a fine guard," he said in his schmooziest voice.</p>
<p>"Thank you uncle," he rested his stance and smiled a little bit.</p>
<p>"How long have you been posted here? I haven't heard from your parents since I left Holrag."</p>
<p>"They posted me near the railyards immediately after you referred me, but I've been working my way up here ever since."</p>
<p>"Congratulations, my boy. It's only been a few ma'tova. Quite an achievement."</p>
<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>
<p>"And who's your friend over here?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's Padji. Thi was posted here around the same time I was."</p>
<p>"You must be good friends. I want to meet hae."</p>
<p>"Oh.. uh sure."</p>
<p>We walked over to where Tinpo had been standing, and just before we got there, Fajro nudged me aside. At first I thought it was an accident because he made it seem that way, but then he stood opposite me and started talking to both of them, shifting their gaze away from the door, and away from me. I saw my moment and quickly tiptoed to the doorway. I lifted the heavy door a bit as I cracked it open: a trick my mother had taught me to stay quiet while we shared a room for sleeping. I slipped inside, and quietly closed it the same way, and then turned to face the most powerful governing body in the world.</p></div>

<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter6">Chapter 6</h2>
<p>There was a constant reverberant murmur that filled the hall as a fidelant spoke to them - something about her province's proposal for a new academy of arts. I was nestled in a walkway between two elevated seating areas, so I was hidden from the view of most fidelants. A few at the opposite end of the hall me glanced at me for a second, then returned their view as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>As I ventured further, I noticed a faint glow from a wall to the left, where Ara shone through the entryway and onto this giant orb. A precise map of the world appeared in shades on the wall with an inverse orientation, as if looking down from the sky. I observed and inferred more and more and fnially mapped out a route. Typically, people would enter from these walkways into the center before going further up to their desks, and luckily I was on the eastern portion of the hall, so I assumed that Melna sat nearby. I would still have to walk into that center circle, probably bringing a decent amount of attention to myself in the process, but it was large so I might get away with it if I stayed quiet and slow.</p>
<p>I hesitated, then proceeded with quiet steps along the side of the entryway, keeping my head slightly down. With every step toward the center of the hall, my hearts rushed with anxiety, but I counted my steps to remain calm. Once I entered the center area, I picked a side – <em>left</em> – and immediately rounded the marble wall and started walking up the steps to make it look like I knew where I was going. <em>The speaker isn't stopping. I'm almost in the clear.</em> About halfway up, I lowered myself and raised my gaze to look for Melna. She didn't appear to me immediately, but then I spotted the side of her face in the front row on the opposite side of the entryway. <em>I chose the wrong side.</em> I picked up my pace to get to Melna as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>"Are you lost?" A different voice interrupted the speaker and addressed me directly.</p>
<p>The eyes of the fidelants were locked upon me now, shocked at my mere presence. My pounding hearts and ringing ears were deafening. I looked toward the center of the room where a lantern illuminated the face of a scornful woman. She looked back at me, emotionless, cold, intolerant. I had to say something.</p>
<p>"I.. I've come with important news from observers in–"</p>
<p>"It is illegal to interrupt the senate."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know, but I–"</p>
<p>"You are in corruption of the Senate. You do not belong here. Leave or you will be forced to leave."</p>
<p><em>The mediator was shutting me up, as expected. But I was too far from Melna to get her help.</em></p>
<p>"Your piety, if I may," Melna's voice boomed through the hall and commanded the attention of all in the room. "Please allow hae to speak."</p>
<p>But the mediator was not convinced. "On what grounds?" she challenged.</p>
<p>"I can vouch for whatever thi has to say. Liffa comes from Heiko with important news."</p>
<p>A murmur filled the room, followed by a raised hand of the mediator for all to remain quiet.</p>
<p>"Did you plan for this interruption, Melna?"</p>
<p>"Of course not, your piety. But some news is too–"</p>
<p>"Nothing. Shall. Interrupt. This. Council!"</p>
<p>"Your piety, if I may," called another from the far end of the room. "The speaker from Pikshi was interrupted by your interjection, not by this maman's movements."</p>
<p>The room began to rumble as the mediator paused in shock. I took the pause to move to Melna as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>"Not another step!" The mediator called to me, but I continued.</p>
<p>Melna walked out from her desk to receive me, and cast me a scowl of disappointment.</p>
<p>"What are you doing here?!" She whispered loudly.</p>
<p>I stayed silent but showed with my face that I knew what I was doing and needed her trust. With much trepidation, she stepped aside for me to walk down the desk aisle to her seat while she sat beside me. I spared no time digging through my bag for the paper message and set it on the desk in front of me. The mediator's anger was apparent, but no one else seemed to be outraged – just surprised and confused.</p>
<p>As I was preparing to speak, the door I entered through suddenly opened in a loud thud, and the two guards I had snuck behind entered.</p>
<p>"Pardon us, mediator. An intruder is suspected to be here. Have you seen hae?"</p>
<p>The mediator simply pointed, and the guards began walking toward me. I had to speak now before the guards arrived.</p>
<p>"There is a growing object in space obstructing Ara. We have five days before it goes dark. We must-"</p>
<p>The senate was in an uproar as Tinpo and Padji came closer to me. Melna yelled, "Stop!" at them, but they ignored her commands. Tinpo grabbed my arms behind me and locked them with the tightest grip I had felt before, and he thrust me out of my chair and into the walkway. "No!" I screamed and wrested one of my hands free. I reached for the paper, but his hand came quickly down upon mine and locked it in twice as hard. Melna quickly grabbed the paper and chased after me. She said, "I'll finish your message, Liffa. And I'll find you after we adjourn." Padji turned around and held Melna back as gently as she could. My last view of the senate was of Melna, in her robes, standing strong as always, with that small paper slip grasped firmly in her hand.</p>
<hr />
<p>The holding area was dark save for a lantern on a distant wall. The tiniest sounds became loud enough to startle me: a short breeze through the window outside, the family of miltas scurrying about in search of food. Even the racing thoughts in my mind made a cacophonous buzz. I was tempted several times to lie on the dusty floor, but I knew that I wouldn't be able to bathe for a long time.</p>
<p>I had prepared myself for Ulukoma, but not for the gnawing anxiety of sitting in a cell alone. The time was strewn together like a trance or a prayer, and I wondered if this silent time was meant to break the prisoner's perception of right and wrong before they were even spoken to. I wondered if the Senate would believe Melna. If they would ridicule her for allowing her jund to break into the Senate and say such ridiculous things. And where was the man who helped me? My accomplice? How did he think this would work? He couldn't have stood there distracting them forever.</p>
<p>A door opened in the next room, waking me from the drone of the cell. I heard a female voice start to talk to the watchman and I listened intently through the wall. It might have been Melna's voice, but I couldn't be sure. The voices moved to the inner door which opened with a mechanical clink, and footsteps began to ring off the gray stone walls. I stood up to see their faces, glowing by the lanterns they held to see me.</p>
<p>"Liffa, you have a visitor," the watchman said.</p>
<p>I kept looking until their faces came into view. It was Melna after all.</p>
<p>I held a hand through the only gap in the wall and I plead to her, "Melna… before you say anything I–"</p>
<p>"Shh…," She took my hands and calmed me with her gentle voice, "Liffa… you did the right thing today."</p>
<p>The watchman left us to return to his post. I stared at her, confused, but then I looked into her eyes. There was a sort of relief there: the kind you get when a great weight of anguish has been liberated from the spirit.</p>
<p>She said, "When I saw you here, I was furious. But when you mentioned the observatory, I realized that you must have been sent by Thimlu and that everything else the senate was deliberating was irrelevant. I read the message to the senate and I told them I had been talking with the observers. Some of them believed me, but others did not."</p>
<p>"Melna, you aren't…"</p>
<p>"Angry at you? No. I'm angry at the senate. The message has swayed its course and it's become difficult to negotiate for Heiko. A fidelant from Holrag accused me of keeping all of this a secret so we could stockpile and profit on the chaos. Now they want Heiko to distribute enough food for all of Palinan to subsist on for 20 days."</p>
<p>"But we only stockpile enough for ourselves for 60 days. And what about their own stockpiles?"</p>
<p>"I know. But we must do this if we are to maintain our position in the senate. We will focus on rebuilding our grain reserves in the steppe."</p>
<p>"The steppe?" I scoffed. "Melna, you can't grow anything out there it's too hot."</p>
<p>"Things will begin to cool quickly. We can no longer grow in the same places. We must keep up with the obscura and move to warmer places."</p>
<p>"And what if the obscura decides to disperse one day while we're stuck out there?"</p>
<p>"We will have starved to death long before that if we don't start growing there."</p>
<p>"No! You can't let them push us around like this!"</p>
<p>"It's not that easy."</p>
<p>"Just refuse their demand!"</p>
<p>"It would risk a war at a time when we can't afford that."</p>
<p>I pounded on the walls and paced back into my cell. Frustrated would be an understatement.</p>
<p>"This senate… These are the people who protect our civilization from destroying each other? A bunch of angry men and women making bets with their people?"</p>
<p>"Liffa… It's complicated."</p>
<p>I paced again. This cell seemed smaller than it was before. I didn't let her see that I was fighting countless compulsions to rattle the door and scream at the top of my lungs. But my mind gave up and pushed me deeper into a depressive mess.</p>
<p>"So… what happens to me now?" I asked in a cracked voice.</p>
<p>"Well, they are unlikely to forego sentencing. A magistrate will visit you tomorrow with whoever wants to plea your case. Then he'll sentence you and take you to wherever that sentence sends you."</p>
<p>"And you'll be there, right?"</p>
<p>"Liffa… if I could–"</p>
<p>"Don't you dare twist your words on me."</p>
<p>She sighed and glanced to the side. "The senate has a special session tomorrow about the obscura. I have to be there to negotiate for Heiko. Otherwise, we'll be hung out to dry."</p>
<p>I took a step back and sighed. "I understand," I said.</p>
<p>"I'll get Kipnu to come. And I'll send a letter to the magistrate in the morning arguing for a lighter sentence."</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>"Liffa. If I don't see you before you leave. Remember that I love you. Wherever you go."</p>
<p>I hadn't considered that this might be the last time I see her for a while. "I know your love. I know."</p>
<p>"The three of us are responsible for each other," she said. "I'll be fighting for home to feel like home. So you'll have something to look forward to when you come back."</p>
<p>"And I promise to bring my whole self back as well."</p>
<p>"Promise me, Liffa–"</p>
<p>The door opened again and the sound of broken footsteps caught our ears. They were slow, and intimated a slight limp that made his presence obvious.</p>
<p>"Fajro, what are you doing here?" I called to him.</p>
<p>Melna looked at me with confused and disdainful eyes. "Fajro?! What is that lecherous milta doing here?" she asked in a hushed tone.</p>
<p>I was surprised at Melna's reaction. Before I could explain, he rounded the corner and their eyes met.</p>
<p>"Did you put Liffa up to this?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Absolutely not. This was Liffa's idea."</p>
<p>"My apologies if I seem doubtful, but this is not the sort of idea thi would think of."</p>
<p>"Melna, these are dark times. Thi knows it. Now we all know it. We need more selfless heroes like hae who transcend the law and the bureacracy to do the things that we cannot wait for."</p>
<p>"Surely the untouchable ex-fidelant would make for a better hero."</p>
<p><em>Untouchable?</em></p>
<p>He scoffed. "You don't become untouchable by bringing attention to yourself, Melna. You know that."</p>
<p>I butted in, "I'm guessing you two have met?"</p>
<p>Melna was quick to snatch the response, "Regrettably, yes."</p>
<p>"Surely you're joking, Melna. Let our squabbles stay in the past where they belong."</p>
<p>"I know your game, Fajro." She didn't hesitate. "We're not playing it."</p>
<p>Fajro leaned back with a serious face now, "We can agree to disagree, but we will get nowhere pointing fingers at each other. The fact of the matter is that we are now in a battle for our lives against an unknown enemy. We must do everything that we can to come together, understand this threat, and fight it back as quickly as we can."</p>
<p>Melna paused to let his words die in the corners of the room.</p>
<p>"You have no business being here," she said. "This decision is between me and Liffa, so I'll ask you once nicely to leave."</p>
<p>"You're being ridiculous Melna, I only–"</p>
<p>"Get out."</p>
<p>He stared at her for a moment, with the same unfazed and perceptive look he always had, and then slowly turned around, slinging a glance my way.</p>
<p>"We'll talk later," he said to me.</p>
<p>Melna turned back to me, and said, "Another lie."</p>
<p>When he had finally closed the door on his way out, Melna came in closer to me and asked me under her breath, "How did you meet Fajro?"</p>
<p>"I met him on the train here. I couldn't have done this without his help."</p>
<p>"Of course. Listen to me, Liffa, that man will do anything it takes to force his will and gain power. He tricked the entire senate into a bad trade deal back when I was a junior fidelant. Heiko and Shaki were stuck donating food and freshwater to some shady mining project in exchange for a rail network. Then when he retired, it was clear that his company used our resources as leverage against the tribes of Holrag just to make his stupid space rail."</p>
<p>"I didn't know…" I said.</p>
<p>"Fajro's words may be sweet, but he is a conniving, manipulative bastard. Do not listen to anything he says."</p>
<p>"But then why would he help me?"</p>
<p>"To embarrass me and lower my status in the Senate. Or perhaps he's working some other angle with the senate. Whatever it is you stay away from whatever he's offering, no matter how good he makes it sound. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>"I understand."</p>
<p>Her free hand was holding hard on my shoulder now, and she saw that I was uncomfortable, so she slowly rose her head again and calmed down.</p>
<p>"Good," she said. "I'm sorry I can't be at your hearing tomorrow. I'll send a message to Kipnu to see if he can come instead. Meanwhile you should get some rest."</p>
<p>I felt scared and alone again. "Where are you going?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. I have to prepare for tomorrow's session."</p>
<p>"Stay with me. Just for one more minute."</p>
<p>She looked at me for a bit, then hung her lantern on a hook in the wall and held my hand through the hole. This place smelled like piss and rust, but I didnt mind. I chose this woman and she chose me.</p>
<p>"I love you, Liffa. Kipnu would say it too if he were here."</p>
<p>"I know. You're here."</p>
<p>I lifted my head and gazed at her through the hole in the wall.</p>
<p>"I love you too."</p></div>

<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter7">Chapter 7</h2>
<p><em>"Do you hear it"</em></p>
<p>I paused, listening intently for the sound.</p>
<p><em>"The tree… do you hear it?"</em></p>
<p>I looked up at my mother's chin, illuminated by the low sun of morning, and then out to the leaves on the tree swaying in the dim light.</p>
<p><em>"The ziyu speaks"</em></p>
<p>"In the silence," I finished hae sentence.</p>
<p>Thi held me closer but felt cold and fragile, like oversaturated clay. Thi kept a smile on her face as thi began to disintegrate between my fingers.</p>
<p><em>"silence,"</em> thi whispered, and I could no longer distinguish her voice from the wind.</p>
<p>"Mama, Where are you going?!" I said, bewildered.</p>
<p><em>"silence."</em></p>
<p>Thi sublimated and coalesced into a cloud and vanished into the tree, turning its bark an earthen orange. The breeze picked up and the song of the Ziyu sang loudly all around me as I lay grasping the roots where my mother last spoke. I listened closer to the sound; closer than before. <em>What am I listening for?</em></p>
<p>"Good Morning, Liffa."</p>
<p>I woke in startled moans, <em>am I at home?</em></p>
<p>"Sorry Liffa, hope I didn't scare you."</p>
<p><em>The darkness. The hard floor. Where am I?</em></p>
<p>"I'm the magistrate for your case. They told you I would be here, no?"</p>
<p>It all came back to me and my heart dropped again. I sat up and brushed off my back.</p>
<p>"Yea. They said you would be here tomorrow morning."</p>
<p>"It is tomorrow morning."</p>
<p><em>Ohh</em></p>
<p>He continued, "I can come back once you're fully awake."</p>
<p>"It's probably best you don't. I would be a mess if I were awake for this."</p>
<p>"Suit yourself."</p>
<p>The magistrate carried a lantern just as yesterday. He wore charcoal gray tightly-woven robes with a white inner layer and a red waist sash of the style of Shaki legalists. His facial expression showed the experience and clarity of at least a Ma'To as an orator.</p>
<p>He cleared his throat, mostly as a warmup, and began in a pronounced and regal tone.</p>
<p>"Liffa Um Heiko, you have been charged with corruption of consciousness and interruption of the senate during its deliberation. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>"I do."</p>
<p>"As a magistrate, it is my duty to uncover the facts surrounding a matter and deliver a just punishment under the law. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>"I do."</p>
<p>"Do you submit to questioning so that Shaki may uncover these facts and root out any lies of the accused."</p>
<p>"I do."</p>
<p>He broke into a more casual tone, "So at this point, I'm just gonna ask you some questions about yesterday, and make sure they check out with what I heard from the other interviews."</p>
<p>I was a bit surprised, but stammered an "Okay" in my sleepy stupor. He hung the lantern up on a hook and produced a paper and charcoal.</p>
<p>"All right. Question one -"</p>
<p>"Wait.. Why are you being so nice to me? I'm a criminal."</p>
<p>"I find these things go smoother when I'm not judging you from my shining pedestal on high. We all do strange stuff. Whether we feel convinced it's the right thing, or a fit of passion compelled us. I'm not here to judge you personally. I'm just here to translate the law."</p>
<p>"Oh. That makes sense."</p>
<p>"So anyway, Question one. What did you barge into the senate for?"</p>
<p>"I had to announce some news."</p>
<p>"It couldn't wait until after deliberation?"</p>
<p>"It was highly urgent; I had to get it out before they locked themselves into a spending decision or adjourned and left for the day."</p>
<p>"Did the senate agree?"</p>
<p>"It's uncertain. I think you'll find many who did."</p>
<p>He finished jotting his notes and then turned the page for the next question.</p>
<p>"Question two. How did you come upon this news?"</p>
<p>"It was hand-delivered to me by the lead Ara observer of Heiko."</p>
<p>"Why wasn't the observer the one to deliver it?"</p>
<p>"He had to continue his observations."</p>
<p>"And your job?"</p>
<p>"I'm just a farmer. I can skip a day and make it up later."</p>
<p>"Well, not anymore," he said under his breath, and continued.</p>
<p>"So why was this message delivery delegated to you, Liffa?"</p>
<p>"It was intended for Melna, my jundwoman."</p>
<p>"Melna? As in žah-Melna, the Heiko fidelant?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Ah. I see."</p>
<p>He wrote some more notes and turned the page again.</p>
<p>"So that leads to question 3. How did you get into the deliberation hall in the first place?"</p>
<p>"I was helping a disabled ex-fidelant who was traveling to the senate."</p>
<p>"My, you certainly walk in high circles. You have a name?"</p>
<p>He stared at me, while I hesitated.</p>
<p>He said, "Come on, Liffa. I've got no intention of nabbing your friend. There's nothing illegal about an ex-fidelant walking the grounds."</p>
<p>I thought about what Melna said about him. To never trust Fajro. Perhaps the truth would help me more than protecting him would.</p>
<p>"Fajro. He was a fidelant for Holrag."</p>
<p>"Fajro, eh? That explains why he was so eager to ask about you."</p>
<p>"He asked about me?"</p>
<p>"You could say that. But we'll talk about that later. You were saying?"</p>
<p>"Oh. Yes, I was helping him walk on account of his injured leg, and he was helping me get to the deliberation hall. He believed in the importance of the news too."</p>
<p>"And how exactly did he help you?"</p>
<p>"He distracted the guards while I… snuck in."</p>
<p>"Ah, that makes sense."</p>
<p>He finished writing and folded the paper into an inner pocket of his robe.</p>
<p>"Ok, I have to get all formal again, now."</p>
<p>He took the lantern in his hand and reassumed his regal pose. It made me nervous even though it seemed silly.</p>
<p>"Liffa Um Heiko, I have gathered as many facts as I could and have reached a conclusion. I find you innocent of corruption of consciousness under the codex of Palinan and absolve you of all accusations of such claim."</p>
<p>I felt a slight relief, but knew the other was inescapable.</p>
<p>"However, the codex of the senate makes clear that any interruption of any kind during deliberation is illegal. For this reason, I find you guilty of interruption of the senate during its deliberation."</p>
<p>The conviction was expected, but it still hurt.</p>
<p>"The sentence shall be a period of three La'To in Ulukoma. Do you understa-"</p>
<p>The door opened in a rush, and the magistrate paused to see who caused the disturbance. Two lanterns were in view.</p>
<p>"Fajro? What are you doing here?" the magistrate asked.</p>
<p>I was thinking the same thing, but I quickly changed my mind when I saw the other face.</p>
<p>"Kipnu! You came!" I shouted.</p>
<p>He rushed to me and reached for my face with his free hand. Fajro walked in his slower pace toward us and attempted to bow to the magistrate.</p>
<p>"Oh there isn't any need of that," the magistrate said.</p>
<p>"Pardon my old habits. They've taken a permanent residence with me." He responded.</p>
<p>He reached the other side of Kipnu and looked closely at me, trying to telegraph something but I did not know what.</p>
<p>"I hope we came in time to defend Liffa," he said.</p>
<p>The magistrate responded, "Well, it's a little bit late, but I'll permit it if you have something to say worth adding."</p>
<p>The magistrate turned to me and asked, "Liffa, do you approve of Fajro's testimony?"</p>
<p>"Only if Kipnu is allowed to speak as well."</p>
<p>"Yes, that would be fine."</p>
<p>The magistrate took his paper and charcoal out again and turned to Fajro, motioning for him to speak.</p>
<p>Fajro began, "Liffa was helping me walk. I intended to interrupt the senate myself, and unwittingly inspired hae to finish the job when I was stopped by guards."</p>
<p>I was aghast. He was taking the blame? For what?</p>
<p>The magistrate stopped writing and laid his forehead into his hand. "That's quite a thing to admit, Fajro, but Liffa was still the one who actually interrupted the deliberation."</p>
<p>He replied, "I understand. My only hope for my testimony is that you give a lighter sentence to a maman who was acting under my orders."</p>
<p>"Well, the codex of the senate has pretty clear guidelines on sentencing for interruption. I would be risking my post if I let hae free without punishment."</p>
<p>Kipnu turned to the magistrate and pleaded to him, "Please sir. Liffa had every positive intention. Thi doesn't deserve to be shipped off."</p>
<p>Fajro chimed in, "Perhaps an alternative arrangement can be made. One that is beneficial to both Liffa and all of Palinan."</p>
<p>Kipnu and the magistrate turned to him to hear more.</p>
<p>"If Liffa is inclined, thi could work with me in Holrag on our observational study of the obstruction."</p>
<p>I replied immediately, "I am not inclined."</p>
<p>"Hold on, Liffa, let me finish. You would be working with our scientists to send a spacecraft up and figure out what we're dealing with. It would take no more than a la'tova, then you can head back home to Heiko."</p>
<p>I retorted, "What use would a farmer be to scientists?"</p>
<p>"An ex-engineer, you mean."</p>
<p>I was aghast. How could he possibly know that?</p>
<p>"I know how you gave up your aspirations for the family business. Honorable, but such a waste of talent."</p>
<p>He was looking straight at me now, with a sincerity that was unmistakeable.</p>
<p>"I've seen your eyes. The blood of Holrag is within you. It's been calling since you were born. You must have studied with the observers just to imagine your own <em>nul sa'am</em> to the stars. This journey was meant for you."</p>
<p>I thought of Jathi, surmised they would need his help to get a vehicle up there and back down again, but I wondered what would convince him. Then I remembered what Melna said about Fajro: his words were a cover for his actions.</p>
<p>"I don't trust you. You could do anything with me," I said.</p>
<p>"You're right. You can't trust me. But you also can't trust any of the criminals in that detestable Ulukoma either."</p>
<p>He took a step closer and I stepped back.</p>
<p>"Think of it this way," he explained. "If something were to harm the you under my watch – the Heiko fidelant's maman, the selfless hero-messenger – it would be disastrous for our entire project. You will surely be in safe hands. A few days on the frontlines of our very species is surely much better than whatever you would get in Ulukoma."</p>
<p>The magistrate butted in, "I believe that Fajro's suggestion would be a fitting alternative and that the state would see more use in applying you to the problem than sending you someplace where you mindlessly twiddle your thumbs in the cold.."</p>
<p>I withdrew from the door and faced the wall. I had never felt so powerless before: my fate was being discussed by a room full of powerful men while I stood in a cell, listening, understanding, with only a choice between two terrible situations. The silence in this room surrounded me, stifled my mind, begged me for an answer. Only the pulse in my head and the gentle shifting of cloth were audible.</p>
<p>"Let's give hae a moment, guys," I heard Kipnu say.</p>
<p>I turned around and found the back of his head and said "Wait, Kipnu. Just you."</p>
<p>The others gathered their lanterns and moved to the other room, the magistrate wrapping his arm around Fajro to help. I walked toward Kipnu but didn't reach for him this time.</p>
<p>"How many people know?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"Know what?"</p>
<p>"What I came here to announce."</p>
<p>"Only the senate. Melna told me it's up to each province to decide that for itself. The governor of Heiko has decided to reveal by hierarchy."</p>
<p>"What's that?"</p>
<p>"In order to stave off panic, people are told one-by-one in private rooms and are given tasks to help so they don't just mentally shut down. My parents were part of the first test, back when we had to ration for the long nights of ash."</p>
<p>"I remember learning about that from a friend. I was too young to remember and my parents never wanted to talk about it."</p>
<p>"All the farmers were working their hardest for the few days we had until the ash swallowed the sky. Then they cursed the air and covered their houses like the rest of us. They got the same rations as the rest of us of course, but you could see that they were crushed."</p>
<p>"We are a proud bunch. When the steam lines and electric rails were coming up, we held on to tradition. There's a certain sense with crops that farmers have. No machine could ever copy it."</p>
<p>"I beliieve it. I've seen it myself."</p>
<p>I reached for his shoulders under a thin, tightly woven tunic that he usually wore under his medical aprons. It reached for comfort more than for attention.</p>
<p>"Kipnu… What do you know about Fajro?" I asked.</p>
<p>"That man who was just here?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I met him on the train today."</p>
<p>"I've never seen him before."</p>
<p>"What? But he's a patient of yours?"</p>
<p>"I've never met that man in my life."</p>
<p>The truth of his deception had finally come to me, but by now it was far too late. I had been a puppet all this time, a passing tool in some political game I didn't want to be a part of.</p>
<p>"Liffa. What's wrong?" he asked, seeing the blank look on my face.</p>
<p>"Fajro got me into the senate because he used to be a fidelant for Holrag. But earlier when I met him on the train, he told me that you were his doctor. "</p>
<p>"So he set all of this up? How did he know to find you?"</p>
<p>"I don't know… Maybe Jathi? No…"</p>
<p>"I'll talk to him. Get to the bottom of this."</p>
<p>"No… Don't bring Jathi into this. I don't think it was him."</p>
<p>"What's his angle?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Apparently he didn't get along with Melna. Maybe it's to get back at her. And his offer is suspiciously generous. I think he needs me but I don't know what for."</p>
<p>"If that guy lays a hand on you–"</p>
<p>"No. That's too simple, too risky. He could use me as a bargaining chip against her though. Get what he wants out of Heiko for a La'To."</p>
<p>"He would need you for longer than that to get anything out of it. And Melna could simply push the story to the news wire if she wanted to kill his leverage. What do you make of this observational study? I thought Heiko had the best observatory."</p>
<p>"Maybe it has something to do with their space rail. Maybe they can send telescopes after all. But…"</p>
<p>Kipnu's face froze and looked worried all of a sudden. "No… they wouldn't."</p>
<p>"Wouldn't? Wouldn't what?" I asked, but it was too late. Fajro and the magistrate had lost patience and re-entered the room.</p>
<p>The magistrate announced to us with his casual voice, "I'd love to stand and chat in the dark with all of you, but I've got 13 cases to cover today. Are you ready to continue?"</p>
<p>I glanced at Kipnu, who was trying his best not to let his rage show on his face.</p>
<p>I answered the magistrate, "I'd like to ask Fajro about the study he's conducting."</p>
<p>"Why sure," Fajro said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Make it quick," said the magistrate, audibly annoyed, and he stepped back to observe.</p>
<p>"What is the goal of this project?"</p>
<p>"Well, it's a continuation of the space rail project. I can't really talk about it without a guarantee of your cooperation. Provincial secrets."</p>
<p>"What do you need me for?"</p>
<p>"Like I said before, you would be a communications liaison between The Heikoi and Holragi scientists."</p>
<p>"I'm not much of a talker, and your Holragi accent isn't thick. What do you <em>really</em> need me for?"</p>
<p>He sighed and looked at the lantern light against the dusty ground.</p>
<p>"Liffa, you don't miss a thing do you. That's one of the reasons I think you'd be a good candidate for the job. The candidates we're looking for have to be lightweight, agile, observant, quick-learning, brave, and in great physical shape. They also need to be willing to take the risk."</p>
<p>"Risk? What risk?"</p>
<p>Our eyes met and he looked at me intently. "We need you up there, Liffa."</p>
<p>In my flood of imagination, I finally saw the dream that he saw. The danger, the pride. The whole planet. <em>I could die. I could die!</em> I shouted inside my head.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kipnu had grown impatient. He grabbed Fajro by his tunic and got in his face.</p>
<p>"That's a death sentence, you piece of shit."</p>
<p>"Kipnu. Stop this," the magistrate tried to push Kipnu away, but wasn't succeeding.</p>
<p>"Kipnu," I tried to calm him, but he didn't hear me.</p>
<p>He pushed Fajro and held him against the wall, with Fajro letting out a cry of pain as his head batted against the stone.</p>
<p>"You think you can prey on my family, punk?" He tightened his grip on Fajro's shirt. "Find someone else to murder. Liffa is staying here."</p>
<p>"Kipnu. This is ridiculous. Stop this immediately." The magistrate shouted, and Kipnu backed down. Fajro collapsed to the floor with a hand behind his head, and passed out. The magistrate rushed over to check on him.</p>
<p>"He's breathing, but unconscious. Kipnu, what were you thinking?"</p>
<p>Kipnu wasn't amused, "Oh come on. He's faking it," but was growing unsure. He walked slowly over to the magistrate, who was now anxious being around him, and checked Fajro's vitals. He was unconscious.</p>
<p>The magistrate turned to me and quickly said, "Liffa, let's return to this after we come back," while he grabbed Kipnu by the arm and took him to the outer room.</p>
<p><em>Kip, what have you done?</em></p>
<p>"Fajro?" I called. He didn't answer.</p>
<p>I stared at his sleeping face. It was wrinkled with the smiles of the past. <em>Were they genuine? Are you simply misunderstood?</em>.</p>
<p>The magistrate came back in with a strong-scented cloth and some water in a small bowl.</p>
<p>"He's still unconscious," I said.</p>
<p>"Yes, and he might be after that scene. What was Kipnu thinking?"</p>
<p>"He gets very protective sometimes."</p>
<p>The magistrate dipped the cloth into the bowl and placed it on his lips. Fajro's lips started to move and then purse, and then he woke in a daze.</p>
<p>"Wha. Wha," he panted through broken questions.</p>
<p>"You passed out, Fajro," said the magistrate in a calming voice.</p>
<p>"My head? Wha-"</p>
<p>"It's a bruise, Fajro. Nothing major."</p>
<p>"Kipnu. What happened?"</p>
<p>"Just rest. He's gone now."</p>
<p>I felt no pity for Fajro. My mind was focused on Kipnu.</p>
<p>He sipped some of the water and sat up, motioning to the magistrate for the cloth. The magistrate handed it over and he put it behind his head.</p>
<p>"How are you feeling, Fajro?" asked the magistrate.</p>
<p>"I'll be ok."</p>
<p>"I'm going to have to leave. I'll take Kipnu with me. Are you going to be alright?"</p>
<p>"Yea I'll be fine."</p>
<p>I asked the magistrate, "What's going to happen to Kipnu?"</p>
<p>He stood up and walked over to me.</p>
<p>"He assaulted Fajro and interrupted his consciousness. He'll receive justice for -"</p>
<p>"Just tell me straight."</p>
<p>"He's going to Ulukoma."</p>
<p>My heart sank. <em>Dammit, you fool.</em>.</p>
<p>He turned to walk out the door and said to me, "I'm going to handle Kipnu's case and I'll be right back again. Don't go anywhere," he said while walking out the door.</p>
<p>Fajro and I sat in silence for a few va'ka, staring everywhere but at each other. A feeling of guilt and embarrassment pervaded me. I acknowledged the senselessness of feeling self-aware about something I hadn't done, but it sustained nonetheless. There were qualities about the gray stone walls that I hadn't noticed without the lanterns. Deep chisel markings and pits where the stone's roughness hadn't been softened yet. What an enormous endeavor it must have been to carve this city by hand. To know that you would never reap all of its benefits, but add your effort anyway. Our whole society was founded on the glorification of works for the greater good, but Kipnu had found something more important. Perhaps he is also doing the right thing.</p>
<p>"Your boy is strong," Fajro said to break the silence. I mended it.</p>
<p>"He takes care of his body, I can tell. Maybe he should take care of his mind too."</p>
<p>He took a swatch of fabric from a pocket in his trousers and blotted his head with it.</p>
<p>"I guess he's not a fan of the idea, then," he said.</p>
<p>"You lied to me, Fajro. And you planned the lie before we even met. I have no reason to trust you, and all the more reason to assume that nothing you say is trustworthy. All of your plans seem to weave together in your favor a little too well."</p>
<p>"I don't blame you. Us fidelants learn to think a certain way. We tend to treat words as incantations more than expressions. They do what we want them to."</p>
<p>"Why are you doing any of this? What paradise awaits you at the end of all this?"</p>
<p>"Oh don't mistake me. I might be a good liar, but I don't do it for the pleasure."</p>
<p>"Then why?"</p>
<p>"This project. It's the only way our species can survive."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"This obstruction – the obscura. Whatever it is, it's hostile. Whoever is controlling it will not stop until Palinan goes permanently dark. You read it yourself. We need you to understand what this thing is so we can stop it from blotting us out completely."</p>
<p>"And what makes you think we can do that?"</p>
<p>"You think we built a space rail with dumb luck? It took 5 ma'tova of collaboration with your observers. We learned everything we could from them and then we made breakthroughs with our knowledge of electricity and metals. We sent countless test ships into space. Many of them orbited and then softly landed on their own with timers. We had space travel down to a science and that was taken from all of us when Heiko backed out of the deal."</p>
<p>"And you're still bitter about it."</p>
<p>"Damn right I am. There is so much we still don't know about space but we were stopped when we had so much potential. Nobody knows what's up there, in the great beyond. I came to Heiko to work with your observers, but they just wanted to track the same information they had been tracking for ka'tova. Now Palinan is powerless. We're huddling in the dark with no plan but to wait it out."</p>
<p>"So you're just doing this to prove you were right all along. And I'm your Heikoi hero for all the PR."</p>
<p>"Liffa, none of our feelings or policies or quarrels matter if we're all dead. I know that our project is the only way to survive, and I'm using what skills I have to recruit the people we need."</p>
<p>The argumentation side of my brain went quiet. He was right. Even if we were enemies now, it wouldn't matter once we're all freezing and starving to death.</p>
<p>"Is it dangerous?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Of course it is"</p>
<p>"…Does it hurt?"</p>
<p>"What, space?" he laughed. "I suppose you haven't learned what it's like. Imagine a place with no ground; no trees no ocean; no up or down, no sound at all. Just you, Ara, and infinite darkness. That's space."</p>
<p>I struggled to comprehend what that was like, but I didn't have much time until the door opened again.</p>
<p>"Fajro, how are you holding up," the magistrate asked.</p>
<p>"Fine, sir, fine."</p>
<p>He went over to Fajro to check on his head.</p>
<p>"You still look a bit pale, but you're getting better. Let me finish with Liffa, and then we'll get you somewhere we can look closer at your injuries."</p>
<p>"Thank you, magistrate."</p>
<p>The magistrate stood up and moved closer to me.</p>
<p>"Liffa, I realized that I might have been a bit too hasty in my decision to switch the sentence. I've decided to let you choose where to go. Does that sound fair?"</p>
<p>I answered, "Yes, magistrate. It's a generous offer."</p>
<p>"In that case, I'll continue where I left off."</p>
<p>He re-assumed his regal pose with paper and charcoal in hand, and cleared his throat in preparation.</p>
<p>"Liffa Um Heiko. I find you guilty of interruption of the senate during its deliberation. The sentence shall be a period of three la'tova on Ulukoma <em>or</em> a period of one la'tova under the command of Fajro Um Holrag. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>"I do."</p>
<p>"Then I await your decision within the next tova'la. I will be back to -"</p>
<p>"Magistrate, I've already made my decision."</p>
<p>"You have?"</p>
<p><em>I'm sorry, Melna.</em></p>
<p>"I'm going to Holrag."</p></div>

<div class="chapter"><h2 id="interlogue">Interlogue</h2>
<p>The magistrate re-entered the room while the cell guard held Kipnu's hands behind his back. In the light, Kipnu could see that the magistrate's eyes were wholly uninterested in his job. They were disappointed in Kipnu, but not surprised.</p>
<p>"Kipnu Um Heiko. I find you guilty of assault on Fajro Um Holrag and interruption of his consciousness. The sentence shall be a period of two La'To in Ulukoma. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>"Do I have a choice?"</p>
<p>"Not really. Rante, an escort will be here just after first lunch to escort Kipnu to the docks."</p>
<p>"What do I do with him 'til then?"</p>
<p>"Do what you do best. Lock him up and take a nap."</p>
<p>"Hah, you got it."</p>
<p>He turned to Kipnu and said, "Kipnu. I hope that one day you might join us to prepare for the trials ahead. Until then, may Ulukoma quench whatever poison plagues your consciousness."</p>
<p>"You think people actually listen to your self-righteous trash?"</p>
<p>The magistrate simply sighed and walked out the door. Rante shoved Kipnu back into the dark room of cells and locked him in a cell next to Liffa.</p>
<p>"Fajro, I hear the hero is going with you. When do you want me to call an escort?"</p>
<p>"We won't be needing an escort."</p>
<p>"You sure? Liffa broke into the senate. and I'm sure people might certainly try what Kipnu did."</p>
<p>"I'm positive. The trouble is over."</p>
<p>"Suit yourself. You're free to take hae whenever. Here's the key, and I've got armchains in the other room if you need them."</p>
<p>"Thank you, sir. That will be all," said Fajro, accepting the key, and Rante rushed back to his desk.</p>
<p>Kipnu sat still and silent while I shifted the corner of hae cell closest to him and stuck my hand out of the little window, tapping on the wall for him to do the same. He shifted in his cell and then I felt his hand touch mine. It was cold and at first I wasn't sure if it was him, but I could feel the textures and shapes were the same and it broke my heart.</p>
<p>"You will come back," I said, "I know you will."</p>
<p>"I will be waiting," Kipnu said, "Wherever you land, I'll be there."</p>
<p>For several va'sa we held on like this, our tears falling into the stone floor where innumerable people before us had to face whatever shred of justice lived here in Shaki. Then, with a slow and deliberate movement, I let go and stood up. I turned toward Fajro, staring at him as if to ask if he was ready. Fajro stood up and without speaking he opened hae cell door. My feet led me out of the cell and next to Kipnu's arm, still hanging in the air out of the single porthole window of his cell. I knealt down and took his palm onto my head, felt the warmth trickle back into it.</p>
<p>"I love you," I whispered.</p>
<p>I stood back up, my fingers lingering on his, and looked to Fajro, who was getting ready to move. With his lantern in one hand and a cane in the other, Fajro gestured to hae and together, they stepped into the light, leaving Kipnu in the darkness.</p></div>

<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter8">Chapter 8</h2>
<p>The ship to Ulukoma looked like it was made by a generation of Throngia no longer living, and instead of being repaired correctly it was patched up with scrap boards and rusted nails. Despite its mostly ramshackle shape, it adorned a pair of thick, electrical risers built to press tightly against the rails above. Kipnu was used to saffas and trains, not this ever-rocking monstrosity. But the trip wasn't long, and he might have believed he deserved such a punishment if he thought about it long enough.</p>
<p>The captain was a tall, muscular woman by the name of Nanta, or at least that's what he overheard the escort call her. The ship had only a few exiles like him aboard, but each was accompanied by an armed escort. Most of them seemed mentally detached, their eyes staring blankly into the void of their own minds, and he wondered what each had been sent for. At the end of the line of exiles was a kaln, somewhere on the verge of being an adult. Thi had faint blue eyes: a sign of kanosin withdraw. He hoped that one of the others was a parent.</p>
<p><em>These people need medical help. Ulu will only make them worse.</em></p>
<p>The ship had sailed until the land behind them had disappeared, and before them was a large island full of tall trees and an aroma of smoked fish in the air. The dusk of the sky made everything feel like the end of the day, but Kipnu knew that Ara had only just begun to recede. Kipnu's escort shoved him into a line along the side of the boat with the others. All of their arms were still tied together and the ship was still quite a ways from shore.</p>
<p>"Ballast!" called the captain, and all of the escorts and crew members braced themselves against the ship. All of a sudden the ship unlatched from the electrical rails and started to lurch sideways. The others around him tried desparately to hold onto the floor or each other, but it had all been oiled and polished specifically for them to fall off it. Kipnu looked up at the escorts. They chuckled as they watched the kaln try to jam two fingers into a niche in the deck. He tried to help, but he couldn't gather the footing to get closer, and thi slipped and tumbled into the water before he could reach the kaln's hands. His own feet started slipping and he looked up again, vowing never to forget those faces.</p>
<p>The cold water pierced his skin and disoriented him. For a moment, direction was irrelevant, but he remembered to hold his breath so that physics could do the rest. <em>Up is to the left</em>, he realized and then kicked his feet to set his head upright and surface. Everyone who had been dumped into the water struggled to stay afloat. He knew he didn't have the strength to help them - he had to swim.</p>
<p>"On your back! Use your feet!" cried a maman. Thi was speaking to the kaln, but all in the group adjusted to hae direction.</p>
<p>The cold turned into numbness as he kept his head above water and kicked his hardest toward the shore. The current was moving against him; it would surely push him back if he stopped, but his efforts were focused on getting to shore, and he had purged his mind of all other worries in order to survive. He felt a tug at his leg in the middle of an exhale and his body went under while another person clambered over his submerged back, leaving him disoriented and deprived of oxygen. He panicked and flailed around in the water until his feet touched something solid. <em>The water isn't so deep here</em>, he thought. <em>I must be close</em>. He dug his toes into the pebble bed and pushed himself back toward his goal. He made it to standing depth and stopped to catch his breath while he looked for other people make it ashore. He spotted the young maman and hae mother, struggling together quite a ways out. It looked as though the kaln's muscles were seizing in the cold and hae mother didnt have the strength to pull both of them. A surge of urgency rushed through him, and he jumped back into the depths with his arms still bound in front of him. He had swam nearly 30 paces before he reached them. The kaln was unresponsive and hae mother was dazed, trying hae best to move both of their bodies to shore, but not making much progress. Without a thought, Kipnu latched the kaln's head under his arms, making sure thi was above water. He told the maman,</p>
<p>"I'll get hae back. Focus on yourself."</p>
<p>Thi looked at him with glazed over eyes, confused and disoriented, but Kipnu saw that the kaln had nearly become unconscious, so he had to move.</p>
<p>"Come on. Stay awake, kid," he said, and he pushed the water with all his legs could push. Kipnu saw hae mother follow him, as if instinct had taken over.</p>
<p>They got ashore, and Kipnu searched for a pulse.</p>
<p>"Shit. No no no," he said. "Don't die. You're too young for that."</p>
<p>He quickly moved onto the ground and lifted the kaln onto his own body. Hae skin had gone cold. In a cross-armed gesture, he set his arms in front of hae chest and rapidlly pulled down at a steady pace. The others gathered around them to watch what was happening.</p>
<p>"The fire. We have to get hae to the fire," called a man from the crowd.</p>
<p>"That's thousands of paces away," said a woman.</p>
<p>"Well this isn't working," the man responded.</p>
<p>Kipnu butted in between pulses, "Everyone, gather kindling, from the forest. We'll start, a fire here."</p>
<p>Those who were able sprung into action while the kaln's mother lifted haeself out of the water and rushed over to Kipnu, still pushing on the child's hearts.</p>
<p>Thi said, "I'm a doctor from Shaki. I can take over if you're tired."</p>
<p>Kipnu responded between pushes. "Shouldn't…stop". Thi understood and started digging a pit in the pebbles near the two to construct a fire. The others had started to bring small twigs and place them in the pit, orienting them to form a cone. Suddenly, a cough was heard and everyone turned to find the child moving.</p>
<p>"Linyu!" said the maman, and thi immediately pulled hae from Kipnu and laid hae on hae side.</p>
<p>Kipnu remained still on his back, catching his breath from all the commotion that had just occurred.</p>
<p>A woman in the crowd produced a firestarter and a still-dry notebook from a peculiar bag at her waist. She took the tip in her shaking hands and revved it up while pressing it into the paper while the people crowded around to shield her from the wind. The woman breathed gently onto the fire until embers and smoke started to appear. The crowd hollered at the smell: a hint of warmth to come. The maman carefully moved the child toward where the kindling was placed and set hae down on hae lap. The others started bring small dry leaves to the woman who was making good progress on smoldering paper.</p>
<p>Kipnu had finally caught his breath and moved toward the maman and hae child.</p>
<p>"I'm Kipnu," he said to the maman.</p>
<p>The child murmured, "m-m-mh," but hae mother calmed hae down.</p>
<p>"Casra," thi said abruptly, but warmly.</p>
<p>"It's a miracle your kaln made it. Thi's resilient."</p>
<p>Casra nodded in quiet agreement and kept hae arms and legs wrapped around the child while thi watched the smolders turned to flames and then fire. Slowly their shivers settled and their wet clothes dried. The whole group was huddled closely around the fire now, squatting and staring at the only light in this place.</p>
<p>"Colder than I thought it would be," said Casra, trying to make small talk.</p>
<p>Kipnu paused, wondering if he should mention the obscura.</p>
<p>Thi changed the subject, "Where did you learn to do that?"</p>
<p>"Learn to do…?"</p>
<p>"Hypothermic chest compressions. That's not a common thing to know."</p>
<p>"I'm a doctor. From Heiko."</p>
<p>Casra laughed, "Two doctors in Ulukoma. What are the odds?"</p>
<p>He smiled to himself - he was pondering the same thing.</p>
<p>"So…" he asked, "How did you wind up here?"</p>
<p>Thi hesitated. "If you don't mind, I'd prefer to ask you first."</p>
<p>"Yes… of course." he said, embarassed.</p>
<p>"No it's not that I think you're a bad person, I just–"</p>
<p>"I get it. I'm a strange man in Ulukoma. And you have a kaln to look after. I'll give you the unfiltered version. There was this guy who wanted to send my jundmaman to space."</p>
<p>Casra laughed until thi noticed that Kipnu wasn't.</p>
<p>"You're not joking about that, are you?" thi asked.</p>
<p>He continued, "I got angry… and I pinned him against a wall. Told him, politely, to fuck off. Magistrate walks in, sentences me on the spot."</p>
<p>"Oh. That… must be a long story," thi said.</p>
<p>"No, that's basically it."</p>
<p>Kipnu felt a sense of longing for Liffa and Melna, and he wondered when he would see them again.</p>
<p>"So how about you?" he asked. "Hope it's a bit less complicated."</p>
<p>"It's…well I suppose it's a story best told elsewhere."</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>Casra noticed that Kipnu was getting sleepy. Thi whispered to him, "Hey, why don't you rest. We're safe out here on the beach."</p>
<p>He nodded and lied down next to the two of them, taking one last glance at the kaln to check his breathing, and drifted off to sleep. Casra looked at him admiringly, as if to wonder how such a good heart could be sent to such a miserable place. But thi remembered that all people have a dark side, including herself.</p>
<hr />
<p>Kipnu woke up in the darkness, cold from the death of the fire and his woven clothes holdnig fast to the damp. His belly grumbled and told him it had been at least a va'la since he ate. Slowly, he rose his aching back to an upright position, and then noticed that Casra and the child were gone. <em>Where would they have run off to in this darkness? I need to find them.</em> He moved to the fire and searched for a flame to rekindle from. He found some branches that were reserved for re-stoking the fire, and added the thicker ones to the fire, while he fashioned a handful of thinner ones into a makeshift torch. With the little bit of light from his torch, he followed the imprints of their feet until they disappeared at the treeline where thin leaves littered the ground and gave off a bittersweet aroma.</p>
<p>The darkness of the beach was something he had anticipated, but the forest was of an entirely different class. The canopy was thick with leaves and branches, leaving very little light for ground-dwellers like him. He would have to track and plan his path: something he was wholly unprepared for. The stories of Ulukoma had painted a picture of a sprawling shanty town, with scarcely a mention of trees. But now was the time to focus; he carried the light into the towering forest, determined to find his new friends.</p>
<p>Kipnu listened closely for signs of life as he attempted to quiet his rustling footsteps. This was not a place for people. There were no shrubs to forage, no fruiting clusters in sight, no animals scurrying up and down trees or whistling upon the air. It was unsettlingly silent. He cleared a patch of ground looking for anything that might have fallen, but only roots and compacted leaves appeared.</p>
<p>"There was smoke when we came in. That must be from the other exiles. They must have food somehow," he said to himself. His understanding of Ulukoma was hazy at best but he set out in the direction of Ulu, where he presumed the center of the island to be.</p>
<p>There was a small clearing in the trees where he noticed a peculiar ornament on one of them. It was made of thin rings of copper, forming a spiral, and oxidized to a sea green patina by the salt water in the air. On the top end of the spiral, the metal straightened out and entered the tree's trunk. It looked to be some strange tool that he couldn't fathom. He stopped to study them, running his hands and fingers against the wires, imagining all the strange things it might be used for.</p>
<p>"Are you lost?" A voice suddenly called out.</p>
<p>He turned around to find the child following his footsteps.</p>
<p>"You've been following me?" Kipnu asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," thi said, "They know you're here."</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"The other exiles. They know the schedule. They wait for you to starve and then come to collect you when you're weak."</p>
<p>"How do you know all this?"</p>
<p>"This is my home."</p>
<p>Kipnu was aghast imagining what this child's life might be like.</p>
<p>"Where is your mother?" he asked.</p>
<p>"My mother is waiting."</p>
<p>"Waiting for what?"</p>
<p>Kipnu looked into Linyu's eyes for answers, then noticed that the kaln had been staring wide-eyed at something behind him. Kipnu flung himself around with his torch held high and caught the nose of a woman dressed in a thick robe of black kelp, her skin covered with blue luminescent flow tattoos. In her left hand was a wooden spear as tall as she was. She grunted with fury at the torch, and removed it from Kipnu's hand with ease. The two began to run, but the dark made it hard to see and Kipnu tripped on a root after only a few steps. The woman ran after Linyu, but in a desparate effort to save hae, Kipnu grabbed the woman's legs. She stumbled to the ground along with the torch and her spear. Her body twisted itself, wrestling free from Kipnu's grasp in an instant, and she jumped forward to search for the child but the darkness and the leaves had veiled hae path. The mysterious woman stood frustrated for a few moments, then turned and ambled toward Kipnu with a furious look on her face, crushing the the torch under her bare foot.</p>
<p>She pinned him to the ground, demanded, "How do you know Linyu?!"</p>
<p>Kipnu remained silent in shock. The luminescent ink in her skin was reflecting off of his terrified face and illuminating her own. He tried to wrestle free, but she drew her spear to his neck,</p>
<p>"Don't run. The other guardians won't be so forgiving."</p>
<p>She smirked, "Besides, nobody here wants you dead."</p>
<p>She leaned in closer to his face and smirked at him.</p>
<p>"We like our prey alive."</p></div>

<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter9">Chapter 9</h2>
<p>Kipnu walked where Setre guided him, the darkness as his blindfold. He searched through the darkness for trails or landmarks as they approached the fire, but his eye wasn't attuned to the nuance of a forest. What he did notice was more of the strange copper baubles hanging from the trees whose trunks seemed to become much bigger as they went on. <em>Copper is so rare. Why are they attaching it to trees?</em> As they approached the fire, he could hear the familiar sounds of civilization: wood chopping, fire crackling, food sizzling, but very little conversation. In the darkness was the constant, low-pitched murmur of some sort of gathering.</p>
<p>The woman pushed him ever closer toward the noise and slowly he gathered the nature of this place. The fire was a behemoth, eating through branches as thick as his head. It would have escaped and eaten the entire village had it not been dug into the ground and surrounded by thick firebrick. The forge and oven were cleverly situated mere steps away, with their own fires stoked by the much larger one. There were people cooking fish and kelp on the other side simply by putting them directly on the brick and flipping them over occasionally. The smell made Kipnu lose all his focus and he briefly considered stealing a morsel. Either through experience or observation, Setre instinctively said, "Don't even think about it."</p>
<p>Of the nearly hundreds of people mulling about, each one had glassy eyes that glowed faintly blue, just like the kaln from the boat. He had seen patients like this before but never had he seen so many people under the power of kanosin in one place, and he wondered if they were kept like this on purpose; clearly his new friend was different.</p>
<p>"Who are these people?" he asked.</p>
<p>"The working class. They come here for the fix and work to earn it."</p>
<p>"What do they do after their sentence is up?"</p>
<p>"Most of them never leave."</p>
<p>Kipnu was incredulous, but was in no position to change a mind. He knew that the murmur of people had to be some other sort of group.</p>
<p>"What about the others?"</p>
<p>"You'll see."</p>
<p>At the far side of the fire a giant yurt stood proud, painted in long strokes of ochre on the same thick kelp that made up the woman's coat. Kipnu could hear the noises of a nearly a thousand people inside of it.</p>
<p>The woman took his shoulder and said, "In here, you stay close to me."</p>
<p>He nodded. He didn't really have a choice.</p>
<p>She moved to a fissure in the kelpen wall and glanced into the yurt, then turned her head back to him. "Before we go in, what is your name and class?"</p>
<p>"Kipnu. But Heiko doesn't have classes. I'm a doctor if that's what you mean… Why do you need to know this?"</p>
<p>She looked him up and down again as if her eyes had seen him for the first time.</p>
<p>"I need to call you something when I introduce you."</p>
<p>The two of them ducked under the flaps of the wall and entered a new world of blue. Everyone was nude or nearly so, and had ornately-patterned luminescent markings on their bodies, much like this woman's. A single drum pattern rattled the ground while musicians played their melodies and the dancers blurred into the sweet smelling smoke of anomin oil, their skin filling the air with an otherworldly glow. And still others were in the throws of erotic ecstasy, divining the truth in each other. Their eyes were brightly-colored with the same light, and he knew that they too were under the spell of kanosin.</p>
<p>She led him through the narrow spaces between people who were wholly unbothered by their presence. As they progressed deeper into the yurt, the air became thick with the odor of smoke. They came to the back, where a maman no more than Kipnu's age sat reclined in front of a broad post, smoking through a long pipe and laughing with the others around hae. Hae body was completely covered with the same blue luminescent flow tattoos the others were wearing, but hae eyes were clear.</p>
<p>The woman whispered something in hae ear, and the maman looked Kipnu up and down with a mischievous smile. Thi motioned to him to join them on the other side of the cloth wall and she pushed him to go. With some hesitation, he followed. To his surprise, the other side wasn't the outside, but another smaller canopy with soft linens across the floor. He knew where this was going.</p>
<p>The maman spoke to him with a charming face.</p>
<p>"Aey Kipnu. I see my faithful hunter, Setre, has found you. Welcome to the Great Pavilion of Ulukoma. My name is Shinna. I own this island and all the people on it, including you. If you do what is asked of you, all of your dreams will be fulfilled," thi said, hae voice trailing off into some other time and place.</p>
<p>"If you choose not to… well you've seen what happens to those who misbehave."</p>
<p>Kipnu stared at hae with cautious eyes, wanting nothing more than to leave this place.</p>
<p>Setre chimed in, "We hunt you down and kill you."</p>
<p>Shinna laughed and continued, "Anyway, just cooperate and we'll all have a great time."</p>
<p>Thi observed him with a feigned frown.</p>
<p>"You seem a bit on-edge. Come. Share the spirit with us."</p>
<p>Thi held up glowing blue syringe to Kipnu and encouraged him to take it. He took the device, familiar to him in touch but not in sight, and immediately tried to give it back.</p>
<p>"See this is what I'm talking about," said Shinna, pulling out a dagger. Thi swiftly moved behind him and held it to his neck before he could move to escape. Realizing he wasn't going anywhere, he carefully looked closer at the syringe but an impatient Setre took it from him and held his arm tight enough to break it if he struggled any more.</p>
<p>"Stop struggling!" she commanded, tightening her grip. Shinna was licking the rim of his ear while still holding a dagger to his neck.</p>
<p>Setre moved the syringe to his abdomen, and punctured an artery, finishing the injection quicker than he realized. A blue glow began to radiate out from where the injection started, and immediately seized his lungs. He tried to cough without moving his neck into the dagger, and Shinna lowered it, saying "There you go, my little Heikoi doctor. You'll start to feel it."</p>
<p>He continued to cough uncontrollably, struggling to regain control of his breathing. But then he felt his muscles relaxing, almost to the point of being immovable, and his head was rushing with countless thoughts and feelings; if he stopped to consider any of them, they would slip away in the next moment. His breathing became automatic. A passenger in his own body.</p>
<p>"There you go," Shinna said while thi laid him down on the floor. The soft fabric was warm to the touch. He could feel hae hands traveling across his skin and multiplying to eight, twelve hands. His sense of self began to blur and he wasn't sure where his self ended and Shinna or Setre began. He put his hand around the pendant on his neck.</p>
<p>"I want to leave," he whispered to the air.</p>
<p>"Shh," Shinna said as thi moved his hand away, "We are all children of Ulu."</p>
<p>The floor became an ocean of silk and he was sinking deeper into it with every movement. <em>"All of your dreams."</em> He reached out to touch the blue patterns in his eyes, his mind struggling to regain control of his newly autonomous body.</p>
<p>Thi said, "Never forget… I own you."</p>
<p>His memory of reality faded into the night, hidden forever from the mind where the luckiest of regretful memories live.</p>
<p>In its place, a series of dreams.</p>
<p><em>Where am I?</em></p>
<p>Kipnu opened his eyes and found himself floating alone on an ocean of thick black fluid. The dark of Ulu lie above him, and a faint halo of light surrounded the horizon. He tried to lift himself up, but the ocean held fast. <em>Is this the afterlife? Have I died? This feels too real to be a dream.</em> Slowly, the fluid turned into hundred hands and began to pull him down. He tried fighting against them, but they held on tighter. He held his breath while sinking into the abyss until he couldn't hold it any longer. <em>Drowning would be ok. Ending would be ok.</em> His lungs let go, and he let the dark flow in, permeating his blood, until he couldn't feel anything.</p>
<p>He woke up again, but this time he was suspended above Palinan with the full brightness of Ara behind him. Liffa was in a small metal capsule directly in front of him. Thi was screaming trying to tell him something, but he couldn't hear hae.</p>
<p>"Liffa!" he called to hae, but thi couldn't hear him either. He tried to move toward hae, but there was nothing to push against. The heat and light from Ara was suddenly blotted out, and he twisted around to see a giant orb of the black liquid approaching them. It swallowed them both, and Kipnu tried to grab Liffa right as it swallowed him, but thi was lost in the darkness. Kipnu kept swimming through the dark, reaching for the next place Liffa could be, but he was getting nowhere. He lost all feeling before he gave up to the dark again.</p>
<p>He woke up a third time, naked and alone in the luminescent cloth sky he remembered from last night. His clothes were nowhere to be found, and he felt a dull headache behind his right eye. He knew that this wasn't a dream: the pain was too realistic. Glancing downward at his body he saw a single luminescent blue line going down his chest, and knew that the few memories he had were not fantasies. Incessant chills and aches began to seep into his bones, so he dropped his head back down and tried to rest.</p>
<p>"Shit, What did I do?" he said to himself. He was still confused, but he remembered Shinna's hands and an unending feeling of loss. His body lay lifeless as he struggled to muster the mental strength to move any part of it, even his breathing. He felt detached from his senses like he was still floating in a dream, but he couldn't see the dream unfolding. The darkness still held him.</p>
<p>"Kipnu! Get up!" A voice called to him from behind the fabric. It was Setre.</p>
<p>She burst into the room, in full armor and spear, and didn't hesitate to pull Kipnu up to his feet. The blood suddenly rushed out of his head and he swayed to and fro to gain his balance amidst the piercing pain in his head. His eyes were open yet he still saw nothing, not even the blue light from Setre's chest.</p>
<p>"It's time to go," she said in a hurried tone.</p>
<p>He pushed her away with what little strength he had.</p>
<p>"What happened to me?" he shouted at her, holding his head in agony.</p>
<p>"The kanosin will wear off" she said, some trouble in her voice.</p>
<p>"I need more… make it stop."</p>
<p>"Nevermind that, you have to come out right now."</p>
<p>"No," he responded harshly.</p>
<p>She pulled her spear on him, and he swatted it away.</p>
<p>"How do you threaten me at a time like this?" He asked rhetorically.</p>
<p>With a flick of the wrist, she made a shallow slice through a fatty part of his hip, making Kipnu shout in pain.</p>
<p>"With a spear," she said.</p>
<p>She sighed and pulled out a cloth wrapping from her sling bag and threw it at him.</p>
<p>"Bandage yourself up and come back into the Great Pavilion. Shinna will speak to you."</p>
<p>"I have nothing to talk about."</p>
<p>"You won't be talking."</p>
<p>She left the room, leaving a still-bleeding Kipnu barely standing. He bandaged the wound the way he had done for many of his patients, but it was markedly more difficult to do it for himself in such a state. Once bandaged, he realized that he was still freezing and without clothing. <em>This must be some initiation or something. I can't just leave, I have nowhere to go.</em> He stood himself up and walked to the entryway, reaffirming his own existence before he went into the next room.</p>
<p>The room had nearly hundreds of people forming two lines that surrounded Shinna and him. They all had the same blue luminescent markings as yesterday but they were silent now, staring at him like he was some prize. <em>Why is everyone here? What are they looking at me for?</em></p>
<p>Shinna and hae crew sat where he entered the pavilion yesterday, the rest forming a two lines, a tunnel of people surrounding him on both sides.</p>
<p>"Kipnu. Approach," Shinna commanded, hae voice carrying well from across the room. Setre was behind him, ensuring he didn't turn back.</p>
<p>He turned his head, but kept walking, "Setre, why all this ceremony for me?"</p>
<p>"You are healthy, strong, and you are a doctor from Heiko. People like you don't come here often."</p>
<p>"What makes a doctor so valuable?"</p>
<p>"There are things we don't yet understand about this place. How it… affects us."</p>
<p>As he approached, the people followed behind him to form an oval. Once he had gotten close enough Setre instructed him to kneel, which he did slowly.</p>
<p>Shinna began the ceremony, "Tribes of Ulu. Yesterday, my ever-faithful hunter, Setre, found and claimed the man you see before you."</p>
<p>Kipnu stood shivering and just wanting to get the ceremony overwith.</p>
<p>"Setre, please tell us what makes your find so special."</p>
<p>"This is Kipnu um Heiko. You can see his strength, but his real value lies in his class. He is a doctor."</p>
<p>The crowd filled with murmurs before he was done talking.</p>
<p>"I am bound to Liffa and Melna," he tried to shout over the crowd, but no one heard him.</p>
<p>Shinna gestured to them to quiet down and addressed Kipnu directly, "Yesterday, you were a slave to the light. Today, you become a guardian of the dark. Somewhere in this room, your new tribe stands waiting to welcome you into their embrace. But we all must make sacrifices for the things we desire. Those who want Kipnu as their guardian must trade something of their own."</p>
<p>Thi paused and looked out at the crowd in anticipation. <em>Is this an auction?</em></p>
<p>"Let the bidding begin!"</p>
<p>"400 kano!"</p>
<p>"3 servants!"</p>
<p>The crowd bunched in and crowded Shinna and hae scribe who was taking the bids faster than he could write them. Setre had moved away from Kipnu and was now clearing some space in the crowd for Shinna. The noise was aggravating Kipnu's headache, so he crouched down and covered his ears to wait it out. He had never felt this humiliated or powerless before. There was nowhere to run, though he wanted to, no place to be alone, no friend he could turn to. He was a criminal, and this was his prison. So like a switch, his grasp of reason shut down, all his senses numbed, his fortress of good will abandoned. He had been broken.</p></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter10">Chapter 10</h2>
<p>A hand fell upon Kipnu's back and stayed there - intentional, not accidental. He removed his hands from his ears and listened to the chaos around him. He turned toward the hand.</p>
<p>"Hold still," a voice called from behind the hand. He could almost place the maman it came from. Thi grasped his arm firmly and pricked him with a needle. It jerked away as a reflex, and the maman let it go.</p>
<p>"Trust me," thi said, and he steadied his hand for hae. Thi had the hand of a doctor, adept and confident, and the injection flowed smoothly into his veins. With each wash of his blood through his body, the headache subsided and his eyesight returned, and he saw the maman clearly. Thi had the same kelp clothing as the others and a mask around hae mouth made of thin woven vines.</p>
<p>Thi stood up and looked at the crowd so as not to rouse suspicion.</p>
<p>"Stay low and walk ahead of me," thi said and held hae hand out slightly for him to take it. He had no reason to trust this maman but was desperate for a way out, so he took hae hand and walked slowly and quietly out from the crowd. When they got well enough away, the maman bent down to him and whispered, "Keep running toward Ulu. Stop on the far side of the valley, under the fallen tree. Run!", pushing Kipnu out of the pavilion. He looked back for a second and saw nothing but a closed flap of black cloth. Naked and hungry, he made a break for some fallen tree he had never seen before in the darkest part of the island.</p>
<p><em>I've escaped! But surely they'll be after me soon.</em></p>
<p>He found that his eyes had adjusted to the darkness, but it was still quite difficult to look for fallen trees in such a dense forest. He made a point to use his ears, to listen for a breeze flowing freely at the top of a hill or whistling across the decaying bark of a fallen tree. Maybe that's how Setre found him, he thought.</p>
<p>He came across another tree with a coil set into its trunk. This time, the coil was polished and covered in sap, presumably from the tree it was attached do. <em>That veiled maman must have put these around. Who is thi?</em> He wanted to stop to observe, but he forced himself to continue onward. Only a few steps, and he quickly found himself facing a giant obstacle. He followed it left and right, and made out the shape of a giant fallen tree thrusting its behemoth roots toward the sky, and he knew he'd come to his destination. Against the roots, he rested himself and gazed into the darkness from where he had fled.</p>
<p>"Damn this cold," He whispered to himself. He curled up into himself, his body shivering from exposure, but it was only temporary relief. He tried retracing the events of last night in his head. He remembered Setre injecting something into him, and a feeling of panicked euphoria. A knot grew in his stomach. <em>All my dreams… Did I want it? No, what am I saying…</em></p>
<p>A different kind of headache had set in, and he pushed on his eyes to ease the pain. Liffa came into his imagination - strapped into a train without rails, flying beyond the edge of the sky. He wondered if thi was being treated well, if Fajro really was using hae life to bargain with the senate. Maybe Melna was doing better. She always remained cool and composed when the rest of the world teetered above a cliff of mindless panic. He loved that about her.</p>
<p><em>Would they understand? Would they accept what I've done?</em></p>
<p><em>Maybe I do belong here…</em></p>
<p>Behind him, Kipnu heard quiet and quick footsteps approaching. He quickly got up to his feet and ducked behind a tree, waiting for the footsteps to approach before he decided his next move.</p>
<p>"Kipnu," the maman quietly called him.</p>
<p>He could faintly see the silhouette of the one who had helped him. It was that same familiar voice of the veiled figure, but the veil had been removed and he recognized who it was.</p>
<p>"Casra?" He whispered to hae.</p>
<p>Kipnu was immeasurably relieved to see a familiar face, even if only an acquaintance.</p>
<p>"Kipnu, you've made it!" thi said. "Come now, under the fallen tree."</p>
<p>They walked no more than fifty paces before coming to the base of a massive tree with another copper coil on it. Casra cleared some leaves from the base and opened a wooden door that had just enough space to fit one person at a time, beckoning for Kipnu to follow hae down into the warmly-lit space below. He looked around and saw a home. A sort of cooking area to the left, a large bed at the far end, and a hand-made table in the center where Linyu was lighting a third lantern. He squatted down in reflex to cover himself, but Casra had already prepared him a set of kelp cloths and stood at the entrance helping him get into them. He found them quite warm – warmer than he suspected.</p>
<p>"Lin, grab some paosin from the cupboard."</p>
<p>The kaln rose to fulfill hae mother's request and chimed, "Hi Kipnu. Thank you for saving me."</p>
<p>"Hey there…" he said as nicely as he could in the circumstances.</p>
<p>A wave of pain began to swell up again and he clutched his forehead and closed his eyes. Casra took a satchel from the kaln and dipped hae finger in it. "Here, rub some of this on your tongue. You'll feel some stinging at first, but it will subside."</p>
<p>He did as she told and immediately winced at a stinging sensation covering his tongue.</p>
<p>"It's doing its work," thi reassured him. Out of the corner of his eye, Kipnu could see Lin eying the shiny pendant around his neck. The stinging went away after a minute, along with the sharp pain in his head.</p>
<p>"It's gone. What was it?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Back at the pavilion, I gave you a bit of antikan to neutralize the kanosin in your blood. Paosin helps the symptoms of withdraw," Casra responded.</p>
<p>"I see," he said. The substances were familiar to him but he had never had the experience of taking them.</p>
<p>"I believe I have a great deal to explain to you. This is my kaln, Linyu. We arrived here with you yesterday, but we used to live here many ma'to before."</p>
<p>Linyu handed Kipnu a wooden bowl of some sort of fish stew, and he eagerly took it with gratitude and started eating.</p>
<p>In between spoonfuls, he asked, "Why have you come back to a place like this?"</p>
<p>"I spent three ma'to here at a dark time of my life. My journey began like most Ulukomai - a slave and a kanosin addict. The stuff was produced here by slave labor and then smugglers would bring it to the mainland. It's a vicious cycle that I got caught up in. Before I was an addict, I was a doctor - one of the best in Rudjan. I would often see kanosin addicts that had come directly from Ulukoma looking to escape their addiction and I developed my own treatment protocol that worked very well. In a stupidly brazen move, I decided to test it on myself to prove to my peers how effective it was, but I vastly underestimated its power and I was unable to pull out of it."</p>
<p>"You were the cause of your own suffering."</p>
<p>"Yes. My junds left me and I was sent here as punishment. This place used to be equitable. The clear-minded still held the power here, but they would try to uplift the addicted. Shinna changed all that, bastardized all of the traditions that kept this place livable for the addicted. Now death and addiction hang in this place."</p>
<p>"I noticed… a class hierarchy back at the pavilion."</p>
<p>"Shinna was a chemist in Shaki who somehow stumbled upon an antidote for Kanosin. Then thi came here with hae stockpile of antikan, and instead of giving it to us, thi used it as leverage to gain power over me. Now the upper class use it to get high at night and by morning they're back to normal."</p>
<p>"Wait, gain power over you? So you were a leader here?"</p>
<p>"Yes. One of three that formed a council of sorts. I was pushing for Ulukoma to become an independent province when I was ousted."</p>
<p>"How did you go from an addict to the leader of Ulukoma?"</p>
<p>"That's a long story," thi smiled and looked into hae mind, thinking of a better time.</p>
<p>"I like long stories," he said. "They get me invested."</p>
<p>Thi laughed, and paused to prepare haeself.</p>
<p>"I guess I'll start where I left off. You remember I mentioned traditions. One of the traditions we used to have was the evening. It used to be a time of storytelling, singing, confessing of love, public mediation. Anyone could stand up and say or do anything they wanted. Then some would group up and explore their sexualities together before sleep, and others would just sleep if they weren't ready. The evening was a place and time where people weaved their lives together and apart and together again, and everyone grew closer to each other because of it. I had been under the addiction, but I had the faculty to understand their words and feel the love of a tribe more deeply than I knew of my junds."</p>
<p>"On my first evening at Ulukoma, I had just met Setre, and she introduced me to the group, told them only the good things that I had told her about myself, and it was then that I knew: Ulukoma was not the lawless prison they said it was. About a ma'to after I arrived, Setre was pregnant and was convinced that I was the mother. At first I couldn't believe what she said, because I thought that kanosin led to impotence. But when I saw Linyu, saw hae eyes peer into mine, I felt… it. I felt motherhood. There it was right in front of me. And an immense feeling of shame washed over me. For who I had become, for how far I had fallen, for how my kaln might see me when thi grows up. There was only one option to me: I had to be the mother thi needed. So I begged Setre to let me raise hae, and we came to an agreement. There were many days when I felt the feverish hand of death upon me while I was in withdraw, but she watched over me, kept me hydrated, kept me sober. Until one day she stopped coming around, and I realized that I had already become that mother I was longing to be."</p>
<p>"Setre…" Kipnu said hesitantly, "She's a guardian now, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes… Linyu told me about what happened to you. She does what she must to maintain power among the guardians. Shinna pits them against each other for who can bring in more people."</p>
<p>"She sounds nothing like the person I met last night."</p>
<p>"I know this is hard to believe, but she is careful with her words, and she wouldn't harm anyone unless she thought they were a threat."</p>
<p>Kipnu was starting to have his doubts, but there were still more questions quavering about in his mind.</p>
<p>"So what did happen? How did you become the exiled leader of an island prison."</p>
<p>"I told you this was a long story," thi said with a smirk. "When I was in Rudjan, working with kanosin patients, I saw myself as just one of many doctors who were pursuing this goal. But after Ulukoma, my life's work became deeply personal and unique. I felt addiction, knew it deeply, like a relationship I wanted so badly to get out of but couldn't. And it was all around me in Ulukoma, affecting almost everyone I knew and had come to love. When I got sober, I could have just left this place - my sentence was long up. But these people were my family now, so for the next Ma'Tova I worked with each one of them to make it out of addiction. The ones that made it swore to me the lives I had given back to them, and learned my methods.</p>
<p>"And then Shinna arrived. Many who fought so hard to break their addiction were seduced by the concept of antikan as a way to 'cheat' on their sobriety, but they never saw a drop. Others just wanted to feel superior over everyone else. Shinna made many empty promises and built an empire on the backs of their labor. Setre never gave up fighting for me and our tribe, grew impatient with my insistence on a peaceful resolution. She was right, of course, and at the end of it she forced me to leave to keep Linyu safe. I promised Setre I would return one day when Linyu was old enough, and I made her swear to me that she would keep the council alive. That day was yesterday. But when Linyu told me thi saw her in the forest, holding you down and taking you away, I knew it was over."</p>
<p>"Why did you come back?" asked Kipnu. "Why would you risk the life of you and your child to be in a place like this?"</p>
<p>"I'm not a child!" said Linyu, getting up from hae chair. Casra took hae hand to calm hae.</p>
<p>"Our people are still here. Linyu's nather is still here. Every person that lived here had a bond to everyone else. Raising children, falling in love, building the village – everything was done with tremendous trust in each other. We accepted our divisions, our arguments; by working through them we accomplished great things. I cannot simply go back to being a Rudjani doctor as if this island wasn't a part of me. I cannot abandon my people to a careless mogul. This is where I belong."</p>
<p>"You speak of them like they're your family."</p>
<p>Thi sighed and paused to think.</p>
<p>"Do you care about your junds, Kipnu?" thi asked.</p>
<p>He hesitated, now aware of the pendant around his neck.</p>
<p>"Yea," he said. "Of course."</p>
<p>"Would you ever abandon them?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"This is the same feeling. It takes time."</p>
<p>He was silent, trying to find words to explain the disconnect in his mind, but the explanation eluded him.</p>
<p>Casra became curious. "Your junds," thi said. "Tell me about them."</p>
<p>"Liffa was… is… everything good in my life. To the rest of Heiko Liffa is just a farmer, but they don't see hae like I do. Liffa holds the three of us together, but there's this cloud that hangs above hae always. Sometimes I just can't figure hae out"</p>
<p>"And your woman?"</p>
<p>"Melna is… a fidelant."</p>
<p>"Why is that the first word you choose to describe her?"</p>
<p>"It's all she does lately. Half of her time is spent in Shaki. The other half is spent visiting people and getting their opinions, so I don't see her as often."</p>
<p>"Do you trust her?"</p>
<p>"Of course! We're bonded."</p>
<p>"Tell me something, Kipnu. Where are they right now?"</p>
<p>Kipnu was confused at the question.</p>
<p>"They are far from you," thi said, explaining hae conjecture. "Has something happened?"</p>
<p>"I fought for Liffa to stay, and I was sent here."</p>
<p>"And Melna didn't follow you."</p>
<p>"There are bigger things at stake than our joining."</p>
<p>"Then do you trust them to go on without you?"</p>
<p>"Out with it," he said, clearly agitated. "Go on, you want to say something, say it."</p>
<p>"The people who come here leave behind lives full of relationships. They invent new worries to keep themselves attached to the people they left behind. They think themselves irreplaceable, but then they return home to find that the world they left behind had been replaced. The grand personas they were building before had vanished, and some… just can't adjust. They placed their faith in the lives they knew, rather than the lives they were living.</p>
<p>"By deciding not to come here, Melna has decided to continue her own life on its own trajectory – and all the better that she doesn't suffer for your rash decision. So what I'm asking is," and thi leaned forward to look closely into his eyes, "do you trust your junds to do what's best for themselves, even if it means leaving you behind?"</p>
<p>He was aghast at imagining what he was saying. "We're bonded," he stammered, "we do what's best for each other."</p>
<p>"A bond is something you say once, in a time of your life you hardly remember, with a feeling you'll never have again. Its meaning is nothing more than the inscriptions on your pendants. It's a gamble that you'll always be content with each other. If there really is something big at stake, then your lives are about to be thrown into disarray."</p>
<p>"What are you on about?"</p>
<p>He placed the bowl down and paced around angrily.</p>
<p>"Yes, all of us have been separated by distance, but this is all temporary. We'll go back home once things clear up and my sentence ends."</p>
<p>"Kipnu, a man like you doesn't get sent here for nothing. You throw one punch in your life, maybe two. And you mean it. This space thing, whatever it is made you worried for your maman's life. So you must know there's a chance thi doesn't come back. Just as there's a chance that you won't come back."</p>
<p>"No. No no."</p>
<p>He paced around the small area between the table and the entryway.</p>
<p>"I have to go. I have to find Liffa."</p>
<p>He walked to the entryway ladder and contemplated leaving. Casra didn't follow him, but spoke before he could place a hand on the ladder.</p>
<p>"Kipnu," she said his name to stop him. "You're a good man. I know you don't really belong in Ulukoma. But right now, leaving isn't possible. Everyone on this island is looking for you. You could steal a boat, but the waters between here and the mainland are patrolled by bounty hunters just looking for reason to kill. We need to make the most of where we are."</p>
<p>"And what, hide here forever? No. I have to leave now," he placed a foot on the ladder and continued his momentum upward. Thi sighed and got up to follow him outside with Linyu close behind.</p>
<p>Kipnu kept shaking his head, unwilling to accept what had happened. This was all just some minor excursion. Shinna and Setre were just dreams. From the Kanosin. He wasn't really a fugitive. Right?</p>
<p>"Kipnu," said Casra. "What's on your mind?"</p>
<p>"I just want to sit and think for a while."</p>
<p>"I've done enough talking, I suppose it's natural to want to digest it all."</p>
<p>Thi turned to go back inside, but he interjected, "Wait…can you stay…in case some guardians or whatever show up?"</p>
<p>Thi looked amused, but humored him. "Okay then. I'll wait with you."</p>
<p>He sat awkwardly, replaying the events of the previous night, repeating what Casra said in his mind. He imagined different scenarios to convince fate to change its mind, but found nothing. Distracted, he noticed the two pairs of eyes peering at him the whole time.</p>
<p>"I can't think with you staring at me," he said.</p>
<p>"Sorry," Casra explained, "I didn't want a guardian to come whisk you away when I wasn't looking."</p>
<p>"Very funny."</p>
<p>Thi paused, thinking, and then said, "I have something to show you."</p>
<p>"I'm not in the mood to see anything."</p>
<p>"It'll just be a moment," thi said, already getting up. Linyu, sensing what his mother was doing, ran in front of hae. Together, they cleared the ground underneath a modestly-sized tree, and inspected a coil that had been affixed to it. Linyu produced two wooden contraptions from hae pocket, handing one to Casra and the other too Kipnu. His eyes were drawn to this curiosity that Linyu held in front of him and he took it reluctantly. There was a ring of coiled copper with smaller beads around it and a larger cylindrical metal bead in the middle. They were all fastened to a small wooden plate that was smaller than his hand, carved from the trunk of a tree.</p>
<p>"This is my newest one. Don't break it," thi said. He nodded in confirmation, not sure if he knew how not to break it.</p>
<p>Casra began, "Setre told me once that they have these coils on some of the trees in Holrag. She wanted me to figure out what they're for."</p>
<p>"What does this have to do with anything?" he asked.</p>
<p>Thi ignored his question and continued.</p>
<p>"Linyu tried different size coils and attached different things to the ends of it until one time it vibrated ever so slightly. Like there was some voice speaking to us."</p>
<p>"A message? Come on, it's a tree."</p>
<p>"This tree is a sort of… conduit. It sends and receives messages encoded in the air. Who sends them? I don't know. But my guess is on the Holragi."</p>
<p>"So the Holragi can talk to each other through trees? You realize how ridiculous that sounds?"</p>
<p>"This is why you must listen," said Casra. Linyu lifted the wooden instrument to his ear, and at first he heard nothing.</p>
<p>"Silent, right?" thi said. "Listen closer."</p>
<p>He focused his mind and listened closer to the faint static that entered his ear and a pulsing, rhythmic pattern began to emerge. It had the sound of a man's voice within it, in a tone like nothing he had ever heard before.</p>
<p>"A voice" he exclaimed. His mind had turned in an instant. "But the words. They're unintelligible."</p>
<p>"Those signals are new, coming from a place far, far away," thi explained. "Normally we couldn't hear them on account of the trees making all sorts of noise. But they've gone silent as of late."</p>
<p>Thi turned toward the coil with a piece of metal in hae hand and spoke into it, "But if the speaker is near, they can be heard as though they were standing right next to you," and like a ghost in his own mind, hae voice pierced the noise and entered his head in its muffled timbre. The sound echoed and reverberated off of some unseen pattern of walls in the ether.</p>
<p>Kipnu was confused. "How?" He asked, "I don't understand."</p>
<p>"I was confused too, at first," said Casra. "Imagine that we live on different sides of an unsurmountable wall. We can't see or hear each other, but I know you exist, and you know I exist. We could talk by throwing rocks with messages carved in them, or we could carve a hole in the wall and speak through that. But what if, instead, you put your ear to the wall while I knocked on it from the other side. And now imagine that I had a machine - something that knocks so quickly that it sounds like a person's voice. Now imagine you wanted to tell a hundred people something. Would you rather throw a hundred rocks, or tell them to listen to the wall?"</p>
<p>"So… those coils… they're the machines you were talking about?"</p>
<p>"The trees are the machinery. The coils and the metal beads merely carry our voices."</p>
<p>"And the wall is…?"</p>
<p>"All of the universe. The darkness, the light; the soil beneath us, and the sky above us. This invisible wall permeates everything. If someone knocks, you need only put your ear to it. The wind speaks, as we say."</p>
<p>"Ahh I see," he said, not quite understanding. "I'm impressed, honestly I am, but why did you want to show me this?"</p>
<p>"When I was a councilmaman here, and people made the decision to leave the tribe and return to their lives on the mainland, I would give them a listener and every night I gave them an update on life in Ulukoma. For me, it was a way to let them know that they would always have a home under Ulu."</p>
<p>Thi took his hand and spoke to him earnestly.</p>
<p>"There are many dangers in this place, Kipnu. And we may get separated at some point. Linyu and I made a home from this hole in the ground long ago, and this listener is how we kept track of each other and warned each other of danger. It was our lifeline to each other, and now we are inviting you to join us."</p>
<p>Kipnu was feeling tense at her words. He looked at Linyu for some sign that things were not as dangerous as hae mother was saying, but thi also had a serious look.</p>
<p>"Look, I know to stay away from guardians. I can handle myself in a fight. I don't mean to disappoint you but I'm planning to leave as soon as I can."</p>
<p>"Linyu told me about what happened in the forest. Setre captured you only paces away from the treeline?"</p>
<p>He flushed with frustration, "I was thoroughly into those woods."</p>
<p>Linyu smirked, knowing exactly how many paces he had gone.</p>
<p>"Maybe you're on your way out. Maybe you'll be gone by the end of the day," said Casra. "Either way, take this with you. Maybe you'll hear us and remember us when you're back at home."</p>
<p>He fumbled for some response, then acknowledged that he had been rash to dismiss hae offer.</p>
<p>Sensing his turnaround, thi held up the device and asked, "May I?"</p>
<p>"Sure," he said, bending his ear toward hae to fasten it. The metal of the coil was cold to his ear, but it quickly turned warm with the heat of his head.</p>
<p>Thi took his empty bowl and placed it in a basin, pushing hard on an adjacent lever to produce water. He wondered where that water came from, but his mind could no longer bear a word of new knowledge. A sleepy look appeard on Linyu's eyes, an he acknowledged it in himself as well.</p>
<p>Casra, without looking, said, "You two should get some rest. I'll keep watch."</p>
<p>Linyu got up and walked toward the bed.</p>
<p>"The floor is good," he said to himself, settling into a space underneath the table.</p>
<p>Linyu fetched him a pillow, filled with what he presumed was old dried leaves. To his surprise, it was comfortable, and the ground was warmer than it should have been in such a cold place. He settled into his spot, felt a great weight folding over his eyehaw, and listened as the sounds of Casra's movements settled near Linyu. Casra's voice mulled over the walls in a soft hum, painted them with the words that lay behind them. Words that Linyu already knew. Words that Kipnu didn't need to.</p></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter11">Chapter 11</h2>
<p>A rustling sound awoke him from his slumber.</p>
<p>"Someone's here," Casra whispered. From underneath their bed where Linyu slept, thi pulled out two steel-tipped wooden poles and handed one to Kipnu on hae way toward the ladder.</p>
<p>"I'll go first," thi said.</p>
<p>Kipnu watched as Casra went up the ladder and cracked the door to peer through. From the corner of his eye, he could see Linyu, awake and cowering in the corner under a blanket.</p>
<p>"Stay here," Casra commanded Kipnu. Thi went up through the door, and Kipnu went up the ladder to watch and listen.</p>
<p>The figure in the dark had an unmistakable spear - Setre was here.</p>
<p>"Casra. You've come back?", she asked in a bewildered tone. "Are you holding Kipnu here? Don't lie to me."</p>
<p>"So what if I am?"</p>
<p>"I captured him. He is property of our tribe. You know this."</p>
<p>"People cannot be owned, Setre. I thought you were better than this."</p>
<p>"I'm not your guardian anymore. You have no idea what happened in the all the time you were gone. Things have changed now."</p>
<p>"When I left, you had such conviction and even more strength than I had. I taught you everything I knew. Why didn't you bring Shinna to justice?"</p>
<p>She rose her voice, as if to say something she'd been waiting to say for a long time.</p>
<p>"I'm not you, Casra. They trusted you with their lives, but me? I'm the one that put you on a boat and sent you away as everything fell apart. I might as well have been Shinna haeself, the way they looked at me after that."</p>
<p>"You sent me away for Linyu's safety. They knew that."</p>
<p>"How could they trust me? I told them you would be back, but you never showed. They had to move on. But I never gave up on you. I've been waiting for you. For so long."</p>
<p>Her voice began to break now that hae presence had sunken in, and she released her spear to the ground, moving close to embrace Casra.</p>
<p>"The things I had to do to survive," she said through tears, "You wouldn't think I was the same person."</p>
<p>Kipnu was moved, and waved to Linyu to come up the ladder. There was no danger for hae here. Thi emerged from the hole and Kipnu listened to them, out of their sights.</p>
<p>Setre recognized hae first, and was ecstatic.</p>
<p>"Linyu! Oh you've grown so much!" she said proudly as she rushed in to embrace hae.</p>
<p>For a while all Kipnu heard was silence.</p>
<p>"You," thi said, "You pushed us away from home. Aren't you done bullying us?"</p>
<p>"Linyu… no why would I–"</p>
<p>"Go away. We don't want you here."</p>
<p>"Linyu," Casra said, shocked at his words, "Setre is your nather."</p>
<p>"I saw her in the forest. A bully, like Ramne. If she had found you instead, you would've been just like Kipnu–"</p>
<p>"Linyu!" Casra interjected, but Setre held her hand out in defeat.</p>
<p>"No… thi's right. If Shinna ever discovers that you've come back, you would stand a better chance turning yourself in. If you're really back for good, then you mustn't bring attention to yourself."</p>
<p>"Setre, I think you should know something. I've come to take this place back for the people."</p>
<p>"That's a fools errand," she said without hesitation. "Only someone with immense power on the mainland could do such a thing and live."</p>
<p>"Shinna turned my people against me. Why can't I do the same?"</p>
<p>Setre let out a sigh as if to gather her words together.</p>
<p>"There is a network of spies in the upper class," she explained. "Plotting against each other, vying for power and favor with Shinna. Nobody knows who they are, only that many of them end up dead. Even if you found a way to topple Shinna, hae spies would undermine you at every turn."</p>
<p>"We can't let that prevent us from trying. We can keep ahead of them, anticipate their traps," thi said.</p>
<p>"Don't you understand? Their games will never cease. They will always find some new way to torment you because their profit depends on it."</p>
<p>Kipnu felt a pang of fury for this place, and for a brief moment he contemplated staying to help Casra with hae plan. But it was only a moment. He peeked through the crack of the ladder hole and saw Casra's longing stare in the blue gleam of Setre's skin.</p>
<p>"I should have come back sooner," said Casra. "I'm sorry."</p>
<p>"Don't be sorry," said Setre, "If you hadn't left, Linyu might not be the bright young maman thi is today. And I have my doubts, but maybe there is some shred of humanity left in the land of Ulukoma. If anyone can find it, it's you."</p>
<p>Setre looked toward the entrance to the safehouse and called, "Kipnu!"</p>
<p>He was surprised to hear his name, but knew there was no point in hiding. He opened hole cover and crawled out, keeping his distance from Setre while he walked to Casra's side. Setre said to him, "Your hardships aren't over. This whole island knows how valuable you are. Stay out of sight and help Casra."</p>
<p>He looked up to her in a different light now. Behind her violent facade was a kind-hearted soul, stuck in a difficult situation. It was her way of surviving, and he felt a sort of reverence for it.</p>
<p>"And you," she turned to Linyu, "You stay out of trouble. If people find out your mother is here, they will use you to get to hae. Keep yourself away from them."</p>
<p>Thi looked at hae solemnly, wouldn't say a word but nodded as a peace offering. She knew they had a long way to go.</p>
<p>Casra held on to her once more, and nuzzled each other for several seconds. They wished most of all for everything to go back to the way it was before. But time gives us only the present, and will never take back the past.</p>
<p>Setre turned and disappeared into the dark forest.</p>
<p>Casra called out to her, "The wind speaks!"</p>
<p>Setre responded, "The wind listens!"</p>
<p>They watched her blue light fade away, swallowed by that pervasive darkness of the forest they'd made a home in. He wondered at how Casra and Setre got along in the time before. They seemed so different now.</p>
<p>"Kipnu," he heard Linyu's voice calling to him and he awoke from his thoughts.</p>
<p>"Whenever you go back to your home on the mainland," thi said, "don't forget about us."</p>
<p>Hae doubtful eyes peered deep into his mind, tore down his defenses. Thi could tell that he wasn't entirely invested in all of this.</p>
<p>"Linyu!" Casra rebuked hae, but Kipnu wasn't offended. He knew there was a shred of truth in hae words; a truth that he couldn't stop feeling guilty about.</p>
<p>"I could never forget about you, Linyu. Or your mother, or your nather. When I find a way to get my family back, I'll bring them here to tell you the stories."</p>
<p>"That's what every no-kano says. They never come back."</p>
<p>Kipnu felt a small tear welling up. He wanted to say <em>I'm not one of those people. I mean the things that I say</em>. But instead he cracked a small smile to cover it up.</p>
<p>"You know what I do when I miss my family?" he asked and Linyu shook hae head. He reached behind his neck and lifted a pendant from his neck, cherishing the nicks and scratches it had gathered over the years.</p>
<p>"I hold onto this, and everything is okay again."</p>
<p>"What is it?" thi asked.</p>
<p>"It's a binding pendant. It represents the bond I share with a maman and a woman."</p>
<p>"Do they have them too?" thi asked.</p>
<p>"Of course," he said. "So they can feel comforted when they miss me."</p>
<p>He carefully, put it around hae neck, and thi turned it over in hae fingers, looking at the detail in the engravings.</p>
<p>He told hae, "If you want, you can borrow it for a while. So you too have something to hold onto."</p>
<p>Thi smiled with a glance and said, "Thanks!", looking back down to observe all its odds and ends. Casra was smiling as thi came closer.</p>
<p>Thi said, "Okay Linyu, head back in or you'll freeze out here."</p>
<p>Without taking hae focus off the pendant, Linyu walked toward the hole and descended back into the house, leaving Casra and Kipnu to speak.</p>
<p>"Thank you for that," thi said. "You really didn't have to."</p>
<p>"It's no big deal. I'd like to be a father someday. Call it practice."</p>
<p>"You'd make a great one," thi said.</p>
<p>An easy pause was held between them as they listened to the quiet in the air.</p>
<p>"Casra," he asked. "If I told you the world was ending. Would you still have come back?"</p>
<p>Hae eyes perked up, understanding the message he was trying to send.</p>
<p>"If it meant Setre and the others had even one day of freedom, it would still be worth it."</p>
<p>Kipnu nodded in understanding.</p>
<p>But thi added, "I do wonder if bringing Linyu was a bad idea. Thi's old enough to understand the end of the world, but not quite ready to handle hae own mortality."</p>
<p>He responded politely, "If you don't mind me saying, your kaln is much more mature than any of hae age I've ever met."</p>
<p>Casra smiled, laughed inside haeself. "Linyu is still my little baby, I guess." But hae troubled head took hold again.</p>
<p>"How will it happen?" thi asked.</p>
<p>Kipnu hesitated. "Ara. Something they call the obscura."</p>
<p>"I see…" thi said quizzically.</p>
<p>Thi arose to head back inside, but before thi stepped onto the ladder, thi called to him, "I can get you back home tonight on one condition."</p>
<p>He turned to show that he was listening.</p>
<p>"Bring Linyu with you."</p></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter12">Chapter 12</h2>
<p>"Are you sure they're landing here?" asked Kipnu. "I think we came in from over there."</p>
<p>"I'm sure of it. Nanta decides which way to turn depending on the currents. She's not too fond of her job, but she keeps the boat running smoothly."</p>
<p>"Sounds like you know her well."</p>
<p>"I voluntarily traveled to Ulukoma… Tends to raise a few eyebrows."</p>
<p>The three had taken a kelping canoe and paddled out to the space where the ships came in, waiting for their moment. Kipnu looked out at the dark sea and the hint of red and infrared that lie above it. There was far more he could see now that his eyes had adjusted to the dark. He wondered at Casra's stoic nature, how thi held the same expression no matter the hardship: calm, intelligent, and resolute. However this plan turned out, he was certain that a better one didn't exist.</p>
<p>He glanced again at the tank of fresh water he had been tasked to carry and his eyes wandered to Casra's satchel of firestarters. He wondered if thi could really start a resistance with something so small, but then he remembered that life under Shinna was a struggle and that gestures of kindness were rare. Perhaps another would take his place after such a warm welcome.</p>
<p>"There, a bit to the North," Linyu said. They strained their eyes to see two ships on the horizon nearing the end of the sea rails.</p>
<p>"Two ships?" asked Casra, incredulously. "And they're so low in the water."</p>
<p>But Kipnu spared no time and began to paddle to intercept them.</p>
<p>They drew closer, and the front ship began its turning maneuver. A huge crowd of people was thrown off the side all at once without bindings on their arms, and they flailed about in the water struggling to float in the disturbance.</p>
<p>"Quickly!" Casra yelled and they began to paddle against the waves, around the people, and toward the rudder of the receding ship. Kipnu saw the clamor in the water. He had prepared himself mentally to see them, to be heartless for just this moment. But then the second boat had arrived. It began keeling, pouring more people out into the water – all of them with bound hands, and it overwhelmed him.</p>
<p>"We're close enough!" yelled Casra, "Linyu, throw the rope!"</p>
<p>Linyu had rehearsed this part and knew exactly what to do. Thi ran to the front of the boat and tossed a rope over the rudder in one go. In an instant, Kipnu leapt off the boat and into the water. The cold bit at his limbs but he wasn't letting it bother him - these people needed his help. The distance was great - much greater than the day before, but he knew he could do it, or at least he was pretty sure.</p>
<p>He reached a man who hadn't moved from the spot where the ship had left him. He was gasping in shock, showing signs of confusion. <em>The beginnings of hypothermia</em>, Kipnu thought.</p>
<p>"On your back!" Kipnu yelled at the man, but he didn't respond. Kipnu latched their arms together, and began swimming backward toward the shore until a woman came upon them.</p>
<p>She yelled between waves, "I've got him."</p>
<p>Kipnu understood her, and handed him off. His feet were starting to go numb, but he ignored them and kept looking for stragglers. Against the Ara horizon, someone was bobbing in and out of the water, struggling to find air. Behind was Casra, paddling furiously. <em>What has Linyu done?</em> He headed toward hae, but before he could make it, hae head was no longer on the surface. He took a deep breath and dove under, accepting the sting of salt in his eyes. He kept gaining depth until he saw the faint glow of two blue eyes upon the sea floor. The distance was too long at this point, so he surfaced to catch his breath, inhaled as much as he possibly could, and dove again. Five strokes, ten strokes, twenty. The pain in his lungs pulled him back to the surface, but still he pushed further into the deep. Thirty, and finally he saw those blue glowing eyes. Turning back was not an option now – not without Linyu. Forty. Colorful flashes of light began to fill his vision and his muscles started to spasm and lock up - first his legs, then his arms, and then he started to panic. A hand grabbed his shirt, tugged to pull him out. There was nothing he could do but watch as those blue eyes so full of hope recede into the deep as flashes of light blotted out reality.</p>
<hr />
<p>"C…Casra"</p>
<p>"Shh. Just focus on getting warmer. Fanla, could you check his vitals again?"</p>
<p>His muscle control began to return along with violent full-body shivers. He moaned in agony as feeling slowly returned to his limbs and his digits. Casra was under him, lending him warmth, and a woman hovered beside with her hand placed gently on his underarm. Fanla, he surmised.</p>
<p>"Linyu," he recalled and an unbending urgency began to build; first from his belly then circling around him and back inward, and it overtook his mind. He wrestled free from Casra's grasp, fighting a tingling pain in his muscles and joints and turned to face hae, looked for Linyu but found only strangers.</p>
<p>"Where is Linyu?" he asked Casra.</p>
<p>Thi bowed hae head, and Fanla looked into his eyes.</p>
<p>"Where is Linyu?" he asked her.</p>
<p>"Have some tact," she said.</p>
<p>"I'll go back, I can reach h-"</p>
<p>"Thi's gone," said Casra sternly. Thi stood up and turned away from them with hae head in hae hand, then bolted for the trees. The woman shook her head, but Kipnu didn't understand. He tried standing, shook out the intense tingling, and followed Casra awkwardly into the forest.</p>
<p>"I need a moment," thi said in an angry tone.</p>
<p>"Come back and warm up."</p>
<p>"I need. A moment."</p>
<p>He moved into hae line of sight, saw that hae eyes were vacant and fixed inward.</p>
<p>"I was so close. I was about to save–"</p>
<p>Casra grabbed his arm and leaned hae face into his.</p>
<p>"You weren't going to save shit. You were going to die."</p>
<p>He wrestled free from hae grip, responded with a voice subdued but not wholly defeated.</p>
<p>"I know my limits. I could have saved hae."</p>
<p>"No. You don't know your limits. You're not some fucking hero, Kipnu. This isn't the place or the time. There are people behind every risk you take. People who are relying on you to stay alive."</p>
<p>"What good is my life if I can't use it to make things right? I swore an oath to act when a life is in danger, and I'm not about t–"</p>
<p>"I swore the same oath. It's the reason I saved you from Shinna, the reason I chose to save a man who was more likely to live than my own kaln. What about us, Kipnu? What is your integrity worth when it blocks others from exercising their own?"</p>
<p>Hae hands had grasped his shoulders, shaking with frustration as thi wept for hae kaln, for Kipnu to understand. But a fire still raged within him. Perhaps it was physiological, a side effect of hypothermia, and if a mind were in control of itself he might have stopped himself, spared the both of them the anguish it would cause. Instead, it smothered the subtleties of his personality and left only pride in that moment.</p>
<p>"I never asked for your help," he said. He pushed hae hands away and walked into the darkness, where Casra could see him no longer.</p>
<p>"Then go," thi said to him. "Go be the hero you want to be. I won't stop you this time."</p>
<p>Thi drie hae tears and walked swiftly toward the beach, leaving Kipnu to his own fate. And as the distance between them grew, he felt the firey anger cool to dying embers. The air was quiet, and a deep regret came to him as it does in those moments. There was a feeling, a welling up of emotion, and the realization that the words he said were baseless and unnecessary. Casra was grieving, and he hadn't one shred of empathy for hae. Thi was right, he'd come to understand, but it was much too late for acknowledgements.</p>
<p>Fanla stood just near a young campfire, looking out at the crowd. There were hundreds dotting the shore, huddled around multiple fires that had borrowed from the first. The bread supply had run out, so everyone was splitting pieces for each other, and huddling to keep warm. When Casra emerged from the forest, she immediately came to her and they shared a moment of pain together. Even from afar, Kipnu could tell there was something special about Fanla. In her eyes or her earnest sense of touch. She knew how to heal the thngis that he could not.</p>
<p>Casra had to cut the moment short. This group of wayward travelers were looking for guidance that only thi could give, and every moment was more time for Shinna's guardians to gain knowledge of their presence and hae plan. Thi stood upon a small ridge in the sand and called out to the group, asking for quiet.</p>
<p>"Mamen, Women, Men. My name is Casra, and I'm a doctor here on Ulukoma. What we've just seen and been through represents the dark side of the mainland. You are nothing to them; just a number on a manifest. But your lives are worth more than your past mistakes, more than your fear of the darkness."</p>
<p>Every eye on that beach was fixed upon on Casra, searching for any sign that they would be safe.</p>
<p>"I wish that I could tell you that things were different here…" thi paused to let a deep pain subside. "But there are some on this island that would shackle and drug every one of us to reap the fruit of <em>our</em> labor, the work of <em>our</em> hands. If you want to survive in this place, you will all have to fight for your freedom."</p>
<p>A single pair of hands began to clap from a fire far away. It was a man, standing near a fire with the trees behind him, dressed in a thick black kelpen tunic with large rusted steel fasteners that seemed to be doubling as armor. Casra recognized him immediately.</p>
<p>He spoke mockingly into the breeze as if he himself was king of Ulukoma. "Such drama, Casra. It's a shame your talents are wasted on an addict."</p>
<p>A young maman dressed in a tight black robe tugged on his arm to stop. The light blue tint in hae eyes showed that thi was in the worst stages of withdraw. He disregarded hae, pushed hae away with ease and stepped closer to Casra.</p>
<p>The man was on a ridge of his own now, speaking to the crowd. "Shinna grants the wishes of those who have earned their place in society. Wealth beyond what the mainland can offer, attention from the other sexes, euphoria that expands your reality. Now, ask yourself if you've earned it. If you're one of those vile criminals from the second boat, then by all means, follow Casra to hae hole in the ground. But if you're an upstanding member of society and you've come here to find a haven from the obscura, then come with me to the Great Pavilion. You deserve to be a part of the new world order."</p>
<p>He spoke like a commander recruiting his troops from the ranks of children. There was clapping and wooing from some people behind him at the fire: his hired band of hypemakers. Thi realized now that the first boat was full of people fleeing the obscura. But why come here? Did they hear about…no…</p>
<p>"I came here just yesterday," Kipnu interjected from the other side of Casra. His words were like an offering: humble and earnest. "Like all of you, I came here unsure of what to expect. I was captured by one of Shinna's thugs, drugged with Kanosin, then put up for sale to the highest bidder. But Casra set me free. Thi showed me what this place could be if we only fought to change it for the better. You are free to follow this man, but there lies great danger."</p>
<p>Casra took his hand, accepting his apology.</p>
<p>"Who's this guy, Casra?" said the man. He scoffed as he looked Kipnu up and down, but Kipnu didn't pay him any mind. The plan was more important than putting this man in his place.</p>
<p>Casra continued speaking to the crowd with a rallying cry, "The Great Pavilion can be a safe haven for all of us. But we must fight to make it so. If you would join us, then dry your clothes and finish your bread. For those who choose not to join us, may fate be gentle to you."</p>
<p>The people began to hum and murmur with activity, while Casra and the man stood in the middle.</p>
<p>"Ramne," thi said, "How long have you been a kano peddler? The wind told me you left before your sentence was up, yet here you are again."</p>
<p>"Casra, you know what I'm here for. And now that I've got you cornered, I imagine I'll be getting a sweet sweet bonus."</p>
<p>"More kano? It's really that simple for you?"</p>
<p>"How do I say it? Life is good on the other side of poverty. Though you wouldn't know anything about that, would you?"</p>
<p>Casra looked at the maman behind him, "Seems you've found someone new, then."</p>
<p>"I couldn't possibly sell it all on my own." He said casually.</p>
<p>Casra looked around at the crowd, eyeing the rest of his crew. They were nearly eight in number, too much for Kipnu and haeself. Kipnu sensed this too, and pulled hae aside to talk to her privately.</p>
<p>"Could be an ambush," he said. "Let's get going before it's too late."</p>
<p>"Go. Lead the others," Casra asked him.</p>
<p>"I can't leave you here-"</p>
<p>"Do it!" thi snapped, still under hae breath.</p>
<p>Ramne's group began to stand up and he knew what would come next if he didn't get away for himself. Kipnu wasted no more time; he gathered people and hurried them toward the tree line, far away from Ramne and his group.</p>
<p>"Where is Linyu?" asked Ramne. "I've never seen hae away from you."</p>
<p>"And you'll never see hae again."</p>
<p>"I'm sure thi'll come running when thi finds out what happened to hae precious mama."</p>
<p>Ramne chuckled uncomfortably, trying not to pay attention to Casra's solemn gaze.</p>
<p>"If you're going to take me," thi said. "Then get to it."</p>
<p>Ramne made a thunderous grunt, and the others echoed it back and fell into formation, trapping Casra in a circle. Thi didn't flinch or cower down, but just kept hae sights on Kipnu. He tried to run after hae, but was stopped by the business end of a long spear held by a man taller than him and twice his weight in muscle. He was jabbing it toward him, trying to provoke a fight. He dodged one of the jabs and took the opening to wrest the spear from his hands, quickly reversing it to prepare a jab of his own.</p>
<p>"Stop!" The maman in black ran toward them. "You've done enough!"</p>
<p>Kipnu rested the spear on the ground and scoffed at the man. He noticed that the other group had stopped to observe, but with a quiet sound from Ramne, they turned around and kept moving.</p>
<p>Casra spoke to Ramne, "I hope your maman is as disappointed in you as I am."</p>
<p>"Thi won't be so disappointed when thi's swimming in the deep blue," he responded. A gleeful look was pasted across his face.</p>
<p>Kipnu clenched his fists around the spear as Ramne's brutes disappeared into the forest with a few stragglers from the beach in tow. The thought of what Shinna might do to hae disturbed him deeply. But he looked back at the crowd that remained on the shoreline and took stock. The maman was still there, unsure of whether to follow Ramne or stay behind. The rest were now all silently looking at him as if suddenly aware of the dangers of this place. Kipnu never asked for this, but now he found himself chasing a dream for a person he had only just met, and it had become the most important thing in his life.</p>
<p>"I… am Kipnu," he said to the crowd, "And Casra is a dear friend of mine."</p>
<p>A tear came to his eye as he thought of Linyu. <em>"Bring Linyu with you,"</em> Casra's request resounded in his head.</p>
<p>"Know this. The Great Pavilion is not a prison, it is a kanosin cartel powered by the work of addict-slaves. Wherever you go here, you cannot escape from its reach. Here and now, you've made a choice that will affect the rest of your lives. You've rejected whatever miserable life you'll find with Shinna, and you've resolved to fight so that others may never know such a miserable fate."</p>
<p>"I choose to fight!" yelled a maman near him.</p>
<p>"I choose to fight!" yelled another. And one-by-one, the entire shore had galvanized in the red light of fire. He held tightly to the satchel Casra had left behind and thought of Linyu, with a flame of hope still inside.</p></div>

<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter13">Chapter 13</h2>
<p>Kipnu was silent on the long walk home, following the perimeter of the island to avoid guardians. Fanla walked next to him, trying in vain to think of something to say. They were both too shocked to think clearly.</p>
<p>"Kipnu," a maman called to him.</p>
<p>It was the young maman who held back his spear with hae words, hae black robes still drenched and arms folded around hae to keep warm. He looked back at hae, and slowed to match hae pace while Fanla kept a watchful eye to the forest, searching for an opening in the canopy where that fallen tree left a gap. The maman seemed to be teetering on malnourished and hae eyes were dark and sunken.</p>
<p>"Yes, Um.."</p>
<p>"Ginnu. Ginnu um Yansha."</p>
<p>Thi spoke slowly, with a slurred tone.</p>
<p>"Ginnu. You're the one joined to Ramne?"</p>
<p>"We're not joined… We're… partners."</p>
<p>He saw a pendant around her neck, but hadn't seen one around Ramne.</p>
<p>"Strange for a partner to leave you behind."</p>
<p>Thi went silent, and changed the subject.</p>
<p>"I want to be rid of him."</p>
<p>"Is that so?" Kipnu asked, unconvinced. "How far are you willing to go to prove it?"</p>
<p>"I will fight with you."</p>
<p>"And you would kill Ramne if it came to that?"</p>
<p>Thi paused, not having thought of that possibility.</p>
<p>"Look," Kipnu said, "I don't blame you for not wanting to hurt someone you care about, Ginnu. But Ramne's not the type to care about anyone. He wouldn't hesitate to kill you if he had to. Nothing but misery follows a man like that."</p>
<p>"He wouldn't. I lead him to the money."</p>
<p>"What do you do for him?"</p>
<p>"I sneak into places, unlock doors, overhear secrets and… other things. I know everything about Yansha."</p>
<p>"Does he pay you well?"</p>
<p>"…none of your business."</p>
<p>"Sounds like he's leading you on."</p>
<p>"We have an arrangement. We're both happy."</p>
<p>"What do you think he'll do the minute someone else comes along? I've heard he betrays the people closest to him when he's found someone better."</p>
<p>Ginnu kept walking with hae head faced forward.</p>
<p>"Kipnu," thi asked, "Why do you care so much about Casra?"</p>
<p>"There's something about hae. In the air thi has about hae."</p>
<p>"Love?"</p>
<p>He sighed. "Not exactly. It's hard to explain."</p>
<p>They arrived at the fallen tree and immediately divided into work teams. Fanla and the other sea-ready people took Casra's fishing nets to the southern shore to catch fish for dinner while the rest stayed behind to build a fire. Kipnu sat watching the twigs catching fire and thinking about what sort of torture Shinna had planned for Casra. Ginnu sat beside him, keeping the distance of a stranger.</p>
<p>"Kipnu," thi started. "I still want to fight."</p>
<p>"Well, you couldn't lift a dagger the way you are now."</p>
<p>"There are many ways to help."</p>
<p>The firewood had been added, and the flame began to take hold.</p>
<p>"Did Casra keep any herbs?" thi asked.</p>
<p>Kipnu recalled the flavors in the stew he had earlier. "A few," he said.</p>
<p>"Show me?"</p>
<p>Kipnu knew to keep a watchful eye on hae, but there didn't seem to be much harm in a few spices.</p>
<p>"Yea, let's go," he said.</p>
<p>He led hae to the hole and watched as thi felt around for the ladder. Thi seemed to have some trouble placing objects in hae eyesight, but finally made it down. He began to climb in, but before he landed his foot upon the ladder he heard footsteps, light and swift in the distance.</p>
<p>"Stay down there. I'll handle this," he told hae.</p>
<p>"Kipnu, we need to talk!," Setre yelled. Most of the others ran and hid in fear, but Kipnu stood his ground, held the stolen spear firmly in one hand and calmed them with the other.</p>
<p>"Setre, what are you doing here?" he asked.</p>
<p>She stopped just short of the range of his spear.</p>
<p>"How could you let this happen?" she asked. Her eyes were glassy, but her face was furious.</p>
<p>"My only kaln…" her lips quivered.</p>
<p>"Setre…" there was nothing to say.</p>
<p>She thrust her spear into the ground with a roar of anger.</p>
<p>"You should be the one in that water right now. The fact that you're standing here and Linyu is dead tells me everything I need to know."</p>
<p>"I nearly died trying to save hae."</p>
<p>"But you fucking didn't!"</p>
<p>She took up her spear again and cut the air clean in two, landing the blade squarely between Kipnu's feet. Her breaths were labored but she wasn't done, so Kipnu took up his spear and defended himself. The bystanders dared not get anywhere near them.</p>
<p>"Setre, stop this."</p>
<p>"I won't stop until you're dead."</p>
<p>She swung at him hard with Kipnu blocking each blow with a great deal of effort, moving him into the dark where she had the upper hand.</p>
<p>"Killing me won't change what's happened."</p>
<p>"Maybe not. But I'll feel a whole lot better."</p>
<p>She backed him onto a root in the ground and he lost his footing, stumbling onto his back. All he could see was the dark of the forest and the thin blue streaks of light on her skin.</p>
<p>"Give me one more reason I shouldn't kill you."</p>
<p>"Linyu had light in hae eyes."</p>
<p>Setre lowered her offense. "Are you certain?" she asked. "No, you're messing with me."</p>
<p>Kipnu didn't know why this intrigued her so much, but he continued.</p>
<p>"It's true. When I dove to pull hae back up, thi had distinctive blue light in hae eyes."</p>
<p>Setre's eyes remained narrow, untrusting of his words, as he tried his best to recall every detail he could remember.</p>
<p>"What has Casra told you about the blue?" she asked him, testing if his story held weight.</p>
<p>"The blue?" He was puzzled by her question, but tried to remember Casra saying something about it.</p>
<p>"It's just a side effect of Kanosin," he said.</p>
<p>"Answer the question."</p>
<p>"Thi told me thi was an addict for a long time before Linyu came around."</p>
<p>"What else?"</p>
<p>"Wait. Are you saying you think Casra drugged hae? But that's ridiculous, why would she drown hae own kaln?"</p>
<p>A series of thoughts went into motion in Setre's mind. Her eyes went blank, and her stance weakened to a slow pace around in a circle. Kipnu took the moment to stand back up and fetch his spear.</p>
<p>"Let's talk inside," she said.</p>
<p>"You almost killed me," he protested. "Can we talk about <em>that</em> for a second?"</p>
<p>"If I wanted to kill you, I would have done it much quicker," she said. Her voice was so sober that he wasn't sure he was speaking to the same person. "It was cathartic just to watch you fear for your life."</p>
<p>She turned away from him and began walking back the way they came, ambling to Casra's old home.</p>
<p>"What the fuck?" he said to himself, and took off after her.</p>
<p>He took the ladder first, remembering that Ginnu was still below.</p>
<p>"Spears off!" he demanded, and she spent another moment looking for an inconspicuous place to stow her spear. Ginnu was nowhere to be found, but had left a lantern on the kitchen table, filled with fresh anomin oil that filled the air with its piney scent. He wondered where thi went, but was glad that the problem had resolved itself.</p>
<p>Setre had leapt from the ledge and landed on the ground of the entryway, bypassing the ladder altogether. Kipnu was hardly surprised by her acrobatic feats anymore. She looked around at the place, lamenting the silence of it all before fetching a cup from the kitchen and filling it with water from a spigot in the wall. The battle had parched his throat, and so he did the same.</p>
<p>Setre spoke to him over the dish cleaning basin.</p>
<p>"Casra has a plan that not even I understand. But what you told me out there sparked an idea in my head. Before you came along, hae plan was to secretly recruit as many of hae old followers as thi could and slowly start a resistance. What thi didn't anticipate was the power of Shinna's spy network to discover them. So thi had to scrap that idea after we spoke today. Instead, thi would have to build an army - far from the influence of Shinna. Thi was afraid that such a big battle would be dangerous for anyone on the island and that's why thi agreed to send you back home with Linyu."</p>
<p>"But, that all went terribly wrong," he said.</p>
<p>"There are things about Kanosin that even the best doctors in Palinan don't know about; things that only a kanosin addict could ever understand. And you mainlanders sent all of them here in hopes that they would never return."</p>
<p>"Kanosin is just a drug. There's not much to know."</p>
<p>"You are terribly mistaken, Kipnu. You would dismiss me even if I told you. But if what you said is true, then it means they planned for everything to happen this way. Casra saw Ramne and knew that he would parade his trophy around, inadvertently bringing more attention to hae. And thi was right. He came to the pavilion bragging about capturing Casra, and it started a chaotic mess of infighting. That was the first shot fired, but thi's counting on two more steps to force a bloodless surrender: a small but knowledgeable resistance within the guardians, and a much larger force made up of the strangers from the shoreline to emancipate the working class. Thi's gambled it all on me and you to finish the job."</p>
<p>He stood up and faced the wall adjacent to the ladder.</p>
<p>"I just got here yesterday, Setre. How can I lead an army?"</p>
<p>"No, Kipnu. Every person out there followed you here."</p>
<p>"They didn't have a better choice."</p>
<p>"They had the choice of trusting you or trusting Ramne."</p>
<p>He let out a sigh. "And what about our numbers? There are far too many guardians "</p>
<p>Setre smirked and said, "Only a few hundred guardians can actually fight. And half of them are Casra's old tribemates. Besides, we have these."</p>
<p>She pointed to a listener on her ear, a bit old but well taken care of.</p>
<p>"The listeners? The whole invisible wall thing is amazing, but isn't it just a toy."</p>
<p>"Have you ever considered how you could use it in a battle?"</p>
<p>"Well… no."</p>
<p>"Of course not. When Casra first told me about the listeners, I realized they could be used to deliver tactical information quickly and quietly. Messenger saffas are used for slower, more strategic information, but if you need to know where your opponent is weakest or how they're responding to you, nothing can beat a listener. People high up in the trees can see everything, and your force can administer justice - I mean… antikan - before anyone can make sense of what has happened."</p>
<p>"Setre, that's brilliant. But where do we get Antikan."</p>
<p>"The armory on the Ulu side of the central fire. Weapons above, antikan below."</p>
<p>"Below?"</p>
<p>"Hidden basement. You'll find it. One more thing: I'll be looking for Casra while you do all this."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Once Ramne finally gives Casra away, Shinna will mostly likely take hae somewhere nobody knows about. There's not much around besides trees but with Shinna, there's always another trick."</p>
<p>"What if Shinna's guardians overpower yours?"</p>
<p>"Let's hope your group can handle the weapons you find in the armory."</p>
<p>He didn't like the sound of this, but saw no better option.</p>
<p>"For now, let's find the listeners and head up."</p>
<p>They stood up from their places on the table and started their search. Kipnu took it as an opportunity to find Ginnu, and he started to search for anything he'd missed. Most of the room was filled with small things, no doors or shadows to hide in. But his eye caught sight of a seam in the wall he hadn't seen before. Its edges were smoothed down more than the rest of the clay walls that filled this place. But he dared not dig further, or rouse suspicion from Setre.</p>
<p>"They won't be over there," Setre said as she entered the room. "Linyu knows not to keep things near the hearth. They're probably closer to the small table near the bed."</p>
<p>She stepped quickly toward the table, and rummaged through a crate but found nothing.</p>
<p>"Strange. I would have thought they would be here."</p>
<p>But her eyes spotted a scratch on the floor of the crate, and she took out a dagger to pry it up. It revealed a neat pile of the wooden disks with fastened copper, nearly fifty in number.</p>
<p>"Linyu must have been preparing for this," he said.</p>
<p>"Thi can be quite productive when thi puts hae mind to it."</p>
<p>She picked up the crate, now mustly empty, and moved toward the ladder. But before she lifted the crate out, she paused.</p>
<p>"Did you hear something?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Hear what?" he asked, trying to maintain his composure.</p>
<p>She set the crate down and came back into the room, this time with a watchful eye. She took the lantern that was on the table, and held it up in front of her. Kipnu's mind raced with scenarios and contingencies as he struggled to stop her.</p>
<p>"It was probably a gust of wind or something."</p>
<p>"We're in a forest. There's no wind here."</p>
<p>She came across the same crack, and pulled it back slowly.</p>
<p>"Ginnu. I should have known."</p>
<p>She set the lantern down and pulled Ginnu from the carved-out niche, keeping one hand around hae wrist as thi tried to escape.</p>
<p>"I brought hae here, thi isn't a threat!" Kipnu plead to her, but Setre ignored him and pulled a modest length of rope from a buttoned loop on the back of her tunic and tied them behind hae back. Thi looked at Kipnu with an expression of pure fear.</p>
<p>"Ginnu is a spy. Thi must be silenced," she responded, struggling to keep hae still.</p>
<p>"Always death with you," Kipnu said, "When does it end, Setre?"</p>
<p>Setre led the rope down hae back and around hae ankles and then tossed her next to the ladder.</p>
<p>"This is too much," Kipnu said. "Ginnu's done nothing to sow distrust."</p>
<p>"Thi listened to our entire plan while hiding in the walls!"</p>
<p>"Thi was hiding from you. You were going to call for hae death however you found hae."</p>
<p>Ginnu didn't bother to fight; thi was looked at the ground, shaking with fear, tears in hae eyes.</p>
<p>"This is exactly how Shinna's spies work, Kipnu. They make you think they've changed their ways until they vanish one day and your enemies know everything about you."</p>
<p>He sighed and stood up, frustrated. "Look, we'll just leave hae here and come back for hae once Casra's plan is over."</p>
<p>"And then what? Thi lives the rest of hae life as a prisoner? As long as Kanosin exists in this world, theives like hae will do whatever it takes to keep it alive."</p>
<p>Ginnu finally spoke up, "I'm trying to escape this madness. Unlike you, Guardian Setre."</p>
<p>Setre bolted across the room and in one fluid motion, she lifted Ginnu by the shirt. Ginnu didn't flinch or fight back. Thi was like a ragdoll against the wall.</p>
<p>"And unlike you," she said, "I'm trying to stop it."</p>
<p>With a great deal of effort, Kipnu pulled her away from Ginnu.</p>
<p>"What's gotten into you?" he asked.</p>
<p>Ginnu breathed heavy and sank into the floor, but Setre had the eye of wrath upon her, and she did not pity the maman.</p>
<p>"This fiend could be the end of all of us."</p>
<p>"Let's bring hae back around the fire. We can go over the facts and decide what to do together."</p>
<p>"You're better off throwing hae into it," Setre said, but Kipnu took it as an agreement.</p>
<p>He climbed up the ladder, stopping at the top to lift Ginnu up by the shoulders. He carried hae in his arms while Setre brought the listeners. The fishing party had just returned with a enough fish and kelp for everyone, and the smell of flame-cooked food filling the air. On a soft patch of ground, he set Ginnu down at a comfortable distance away while the others stared at them in curiosity.</p>
<p>"Why is thi tied up?" asked a maman.</p>
<p>"Nothing. It's Setre."</p>
<p>"Tried to take a swing at her, eh?" the maman asked.</p>
<p>"No nothing like that. We're worried thi might run away."</p>
<p>"To Ramne, you mean," said a man.</p>
<p>He looked up at the man he was speaking to. He had the faint glow of kanosin in his eyes - one of the bound. He chose his words carefully, for fear that he was in the presence of other spies he did not know.</p>
<p>"Let's have dinner first, then we'll decide what to do with hae."</p>
<p>Fanla came to them with three fish, wrapped with kelp and cooked over the fire. She gave two to Setre and one to Kipnu. <em>Fair</em>, he thought. He broke his fish in two, and fed Ginnu the larger piece, much to Setre's disgust.</p>
<p>Everyone in the group took turns introducing themselves. Some had come as families, others as individuals, but all of the voluntary migrants had come only with the knowledge that Ulukoma was a mysterious island where people lived in the dark, and decided to throw their lives at it in a panic. Kipnu was amused at the irony of people migrating into the darkness to flee from another darkness. But he knew that if he were given the same situation, he would likely have reached the same conclusion.</p>
<p>Once they were done, Setre called for their ears.</p>
<p>"New Ulukomans. We have a matter to discuss - the fate of the spy Ginnu um Yansha."</p>
<p>Kipnu interrupted her, "And we will not suppose hae to be guilty until we can prove hae to be guilty."</p>
<p>"-Can we afford such luxuries in a time of crisis?"</p>
<p>"-And what business do we have staging a coup if we cannot aspire to do better?"</p>
<p>The two of them locked eyes, knowing that they had begun a crucially important debate.</p>
<p>"Why don't you begin, Kipnu," Setre suggested, and Kipnu begrudgingly obliged.</p>
<p>"Ginnu landed here today just like any of us - tossed into the water, fighting for hae life. Thi may have come with Ramne, but that is beside the point, because thi is here with us now. Hae intention is to be done with hae past life - to bury it where it stands, and to kill Ramne if it came to that. Thi's told me this haeself, as Fanla is my witness."</p>
<p>All eyes immediately turned to her, and she blushed with discomfort.</p>
<p>Setre interrupted with arguments of her own, "But consider the sorts of people that run with Ramne: drug peddlers, political informants, and yes, spies. Just like Shinna, he has his own network that runs deep into the hearts of every major city in the mainland. And it ran deep into the cracks of Casra's home, where we found Ginnu mere moments ago. We are the greatest threat to Ramne's supply of Kanosin right now. And he would do anything to stop us."</p>
<p>"Even if thi were spying on us - and might I remind you, that there is no evidence to prove it - Ramne would want hae back safe and sound. Ginnu is adept in skills that he could never possess - skills that make him immensely wealthy. We need to keep Ginnu in case we need to negotiate for Casra's safe return."</p>
<p>Setre glanced at him, as if impressed that she hadn't thought of that possibility.</p>
<p>She said, "Those who favor hae freedom, stand on the left. Those who favor hae captivity, please stay in the middle. And those who favor death, please stand on the right."</p>
<p>The crowd dispersed into a larger blob, and then began to form into amorphous groups. Many stood between the crowds, or outside of them altogether, unable to decide such an important thing in so little time. They talked amongst themselves, moving about as they changed their minds, gradually forming a more concrete set of decisions. Only Fanla abstained in the end, unwilling to decide such a thing.</p>
<p>Ginnu looked up to him as the crowd fell in. "Thank you," thi whispered to him through tearful eyes. If this was all an act, it was quite convincing.</p>
<p>"Don't look," he told hae, eyeing the few who chose death. There was a sort of fear in their eyes that was paired with guilt. They dared not look at them directly. "Nothing good can come from seeing them."</p>
<p>"The people have spoken in favor of captivity" said Setre, and the crowd stayed silent, walking back to their old spots to finish dinner, with a strange air of division among them.</p>
<p>"You heard them," said Setre, sitting down next to him, on the other side of Ginnu.</p>
<p>"I'll make sure thi remains tied. Leave Ginnu with me."</p>
<p>"Like I left Casra and Linyu with you?"</p>
<p>She sighed and held her head with her hand, a tinge of regret in her expression.</p>
<p>"Fanla should be with hae", she said. "She has warmth and strength and no bias toward either of us."</p>
<p>"Sure," he said. "I'll ask her in a bit."</p>
<p>She took a deep breath and stood up, exhaling in a sort of departure sound.</p>
<p>"I have to go soon. The old tribe needs my guidance."</p>
<p>She attached a listener she'd taken from the crate to her ear, made sure it was snug.</p>
<p>"Be ready to start at the fall of Ara," she said pointing to it.</p>
<p>"The fall of Ara?"</p>
<p>"Watch from the treetops. You'll know what I mean."</p>
<p>She set off back into the trees, and Kipnu felt a pang of sadness as she left. Despite her attacks that she insisted were not for murder, and the makeshift court they'd formed, he knew that her heart was in the right place. Perhaps a clearing of the air was needed. Now he knew where they collectively stood: a thoughtful set of people who were unwilling to rush to conclusions.</p>
<p>Before she vanished into the dark again, he fetched a listener from the crate and moved to a tree nearby.</p>
<p>"The wind speaks!" he annunciated into the coil.</p>
<p>He saw her blue light veer to the left and stop near a tree of her own.</p>
<p>"Casra sounds a lot cooler when thi says it," she replied.</p></div>

<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter14">Chapter 14</h2>
<p>Kipnu stopped them at the top of the hill overlooking the pavilion, smelling the first hints of fire in the air. Ara was but a reddish sliver on the horizon, a view that he never fathomed to see. He turned around and signaled to them to gather in close. Huddled to his right was Fanla, who held the length of rope binding Ginnu's hands. It was an unpleasant position for the both of them, but she understood the weight of the job.</p>
<p>"From this point on, we'll split into the two groups I mentioned before. Stay with your partners at all times; if one of them is hurt, make sure that the area is safe and get the both of yourselves out of here. If they have a listener, take it off of them and put it on yourself. If you're about to be captured, destroy it. We cannot let them get a hold of one. And finally, we are not here to fight, we are here to liberate. Even if we have all of the weapons and antikan on Ulukoma, we wouldn't be able to defeat the guardians. Do not attack unless your life is in danger. Everyone clear?"</p>
<p>They made a gesture with their hands in assent, a sort of salute of honor that Kipnu had learned from Melna.</p>
<p>"Ground team, stay here until you hear us through your listeners. Sky team, let's move."</p>
<p>Kipnu took him through the forest, ever closer to the fire until they came upon a tree with a slight lean toward the pavilion. Its roots looked as sturdy as any other tree and its trunk was littered with a coil here and there, a sign that Linyu had often climbed it.</p>
<p>"This one," he whispered, looking up into the dark abyss, imagining Linyu there among its branches. He tied a rope to himself, leaving two long ends free, and began the climb up the tree. The lean helped to support their weight on each vault to the next position. With such a large tree, Kipnu was struggling to secure his footing on the bark, but he learned to find the various crevasses that formed out of the bark and use them to his advantage.</p>
<p>He came to a large branch and tossed one of the ropes at his back over the top of it, and a woman below took the other end in her hands. There was such a strong sense of safety in something so simple as a friendly hand end of a rope, he thought. He shook his hands to clear out any soreness and dry the water from his palms. There was another half to go.</p>
<p>A plethora of branches and rays of red light greeted him near the top, where he tossed the other rope over the thickest branch he could find and gave it a good shake to signal that he was ready. Now all he had to do was wait for the others to join him.</p>
<p>This place was bathed in the light of Ara, a sprawling terrain of densely-packed leaves and branches bobbing in the wind, spread across the horizon's curve like the earth itself had become an ocean. He had shield his eyes from the searing brightness to look in the direction of the mainland. In the distance to the north, he could make out the Shaki Mountains, and saw some lights from the hill where Yansha sat. A bit to the south was the Rudjan wetlands, lit brightly with the boat lanterns he'd heard about but never saw for himself. And all along the coast were lines of houses and farms and patches of trees, mere specks on the land that formed a geometric pattern as natural as Ara itself.</p>
<p>He turned around to look toward Ulu. Through the darkness, Kipnu could see patches of clouds that faded into Ulu. But if he stared long enough, he could see tiny specks of faint red and infrared hanging in the sky, ever still, ever bright. Like the small children of Ara. He wondered at what they might be, how long they'd been just beyond the veil of Ara.</p>
<p>Three people in total made it up the tree, shielding their eyes and gasping at the beauty of what they were seeing. They made their way from tree to tree atop the intertwined branches and toward the clearing that marked the fire and the pavilion. They came upon a larger tree at the perimeter of the clearing they'd been looking for and perched to look below, making mental maps of the terrain and feeling the warm smoky currents from the fire mix with the wind. They counted seven blue lights from guardians scattered around the fire. Two of them were sparring with sticks near the kitchen and the others were eating a late dinner closer to the armory.</p>
<p>Kipnu pulled a listener out of a satchel he was carrying and removed the coil assembly from the wooden puck. With a small tool he'd found in Casra's home, he cleaved a hole into the branch and inserted the end of the coil that stuck out, giving time for the fresh wet wood take to it. As they waited, they watched as the last sliver of light extinguished itself into the ground, and an eerie feeling overcame them. They knew that this strange new kind of darkness would soon be everywhere.</p>
<p>A maman, Penyi, produced a listener of hae own and asked for Kipnu to say something into the newly fastened coil.</p>
<p>"The wind speaks," he said with tone of conviction: the sort that Casra spoke with. He'd hoped that Setre was listening.</p>
<p>The maman with the listener nodded to him and he smiled, knowing Linyu's work hadn't gone to waste. He made a departing gesture to the three and made his way back across the branches and down the leaning tree, all the while wondering about in those strange red dots in the sky, and Linyu's strange blue eyes in the deep.</p>
<p>"Seven guardians around the fire," he told the ground team. "Five near the armory. We'll approach from Ulu-side."</p>
<p>And without a moment to pause, he led them in a sparse line through the forest, around the pavilion grounds and further into the dark.</p>
<p>Penyi's voice chimed in through the listener. "There's a commotion in the pavilion," thi said, "The guardians are leaving the armory."</p>
<p>"Now's our chance," he told them. "I need four volunteers to come with me. Walk silently and spread out."</p>
<p>He didn't stop to choose but began walking right as he'd given the order. He knew that time was short.</p>
<p>They reached the back side of the armory tent and Kipnu switched to gestures: a hand from his chest to the underside of the tent, then onto the ground in a waving motion. The four rose their hands in confirmation and he went down into the dirt, underneath the cloth, and arose in a makeshift room lit only by the fire from the far side. He firmly grasped his stolen spear and looked for signs of movement, but saw only racks upon racks of spears and daggers and huge fishing nets with metal weights, All of them hardened and polished to a mirror finish.</p>
<p>"Three guardians running toward the armory," said Penyi, and Kinpu suddenly found himself in the middle of the tent, looking for a place to hide. He considered running back toward the place he came in, but knew that if they spotted him, they would be led to the others. There was no option but to stay far away, taking cover behind racks and move with them.</p>
<p>"Those damned traitors," said a woman as she entered.</p>
<p>A man's voice followed hers, "We need fifty, maybe sixty. Fetch fifteen, each of you. I'll handle the rest."</p>
<p><em>Ramne. Of course he's leading the counter-resistance.</em></p>
<p>Kipnu's eyes were trained upon the three figures, watching every move, thinking of contingencies in case they noticed him there in the corner. But for now, they were focused on their work.</p>
<p>"You done yet?" said Ramne, impatiently piling spears into their already-full arms. Ramne's lackies had cleared the racks near their side of the armory, and ran off on their way to fight Setre's force, leaving Ramne alone with him.</p>
<p><em>I could dispatch Ramne now. Just a dagger in the back</em>, he thought, <em>wipe that smugness clean off his face</em>.</p>
<p>Kipnu took a dagger carefully from the stand in front of him, and held it snugly in his hands, imagined getting close enough to land a solid blow in one quick motion. But Ramne had other plans. He paced the racks up and down, with Kipnu moving between the racks discreetly to stay out of his line of sight.</p>
<p>"Ahh," he whispered to himself atop a conspicuously placed carpet. "Just what I was looking for."</p>
<p>He tossed aside the carpet and revealed a small wooden door among the thin damp leaves that had meandered there. Its polished hinges and edge moulding were too precise to be made in Ulukoma – closer to Shaki design – but the hinges were covered in a thick grease, as if whoever had placed it there wanted to be the only person using it. With a small jump Ramne fell into the hole, landing squarely upon a stone floor below. <em>What's he want antikan for?</em> Kipnu wondered, and he slowly approached the hole to peer in.</p>
<p>It was dark save for the patterened blue streaks across Ramne's chest that showed a row of crates lining the wall in front of him. He opened one and pulled out a metallic cylinder of some sort, looking it over in his hands.</p>
<p>"Yes, that'll do nicely," he said.</p>
<p>He pulled out three others, packed them in a satchel hung over his left shoulder, and shut the crate. Kipnu moved back to avoid being seen, but Ramne stayed below. He looked again and saw Ramne's blue light illuminating the marred features of a familiar face.</p>
<p>"You awake now?" Ramne murmured and reached for hae arm, measuring the life left in hae body.</p>
<p>Casra didn't answer.</p>
<p>"Good," he said with a hint of remorse in his voice. But he didn't stick around to grieve or regret. Kipnu removed himself from the hole as Ramne lifted himself out and covered any sign of there having been a door in the floor.</p>
<p>This would be his last chance to stop Ramne, but surely someone would come to the armory looking for Ramne if he never appeared again. He couldn't risk being found while trying to pull Casra out of whatever state thi was in. And just as quickly as he thought it, the woman from before came through the entryway and barked at him.</p>
<p>"You coming?" she asked in a rush.</p>
<p>He lunged at her, covering nearly half the room in a single step, but she moved out of his way just in time.</p>
<p>His voice boomed at her in a sort of low-pitched growl. "If you ever rush me again, you'll be the one locked in the cellar."</p>
<p>She looked him up and down with a disgusted, dismissive look on her face and ran off back toward the pavilion, while Ramne picked up a spear of his own.</p>
<p>"Time to bring a light back to Ulu," he said, and stepped out into the firelight.</p>
<p>With no time to waste, Kipnu ran over to where he'd entered and signalled to the other four to come in.</p>
<p>"I heard Ramne," said a young man. He was frightened for his life.</p>
<p>"It's okay, Ramne is gone," Kipnu whispered, knowing that the walls, though opaque, were not soundproof. "But we have to move quick. Grab a spear and go fetch the others. Can you do that?"</p>
<p>He nodded and ran off toward the back of the tent, forgetting the spear. Kipnu turned to the others and said, "You three, come with me."</p>
<p>Together they opened the cellar door and descended into the darkness with only Kipnu's memory to light their path.</p>
<p>"This room is a long trench," he told them. "There are crates lining the walls that should be full of antikan, but there may be something else down there. Find the antikan and move it topside."</p>
<p>He started to walk further into the darkness, and one of them asked him, "Where are you going?"</p>
<p>"Casra needs medical attention," he told them, and they didn't speak a word.</p>
<p>He moved to Casra who was still against the wall where Ramne kept hae. Kipnu felt for a pulse. <em>Still ticking</em>. Thi began to stir and moan, but Kipnu kept hae still.</p>
<p>"Hey it's me, Kipnu. Stay as still as you can. I'm gonna get you down okay?"</p>
<p>He felt around hae gently for some sort of shackle, noticed a multitude of scrapes and lacerations on hae shoulder and up hae neck.</p>
<p>"How is your head? Does it hurt?" he asked as he moved his hand to hae head. His fingers meandered onto a strange ridge in front of hae ear.</p>
<p>"Ahhhh," thi groaned immediately as his hand came to it.</p>
<p>"Ok. I can work with that."</p>
<p>With graceful and deliberate touches, he assessed the injury, stopping whenever thi moaned in pain. It seemed to be a large welt just in front of hae ear, and it was filling with fluid. He knew it was a skull fracture.</p>
<p>"How did this happen?" he asked hae. But thi didn't respond. He touched hae shoulder and felt a violent shaking in hae body.</p>
<p>"No no that's too soon!" he said to the air.</p>
<p>He removed a firestarter from his satchel and turned its knob. A ceramic cylinder spun in a metallic socket, sending small sparks and the odor of magnesium smoke into the air. In one slow motion, he ran the top of the dagger across the tip of the firestarter and its heat turned the blade yellow with oxidation. He turned to the welt and cut open a small hole at the bottom of the welt with a calculated movement of his hand. A mix of blood and fluid formed a tangible rivulet across hae face as the welt emptied, quickly at first but slowing with time. Kipnu dropped the knife and held his fingers fast to hae chest, continuously checking for a pulse as hae consciousness slowly began to return.</p>
<p>"Kipnu," thi said in a daze, "Is that you? Am I dying?"</p>
<p>"You'll be fine," he lied. "Just stay strong."</p>
<p>The other three had finished moving crates and the sound of many footsteps filled the room above, but Kipnu was steeped in concentration, looking for kanosin to use as a pain reducer. He checked the crates that the others had opened, but found nothing but more of those strange cylinders that Ramne had taken with him.</p>
<p>"Casra?" he called hae name, secretly hoping thi might have gone unconscious again.</p>
<p>"The patient is bleeding everywhere," thi said in a dazed tone, "Needs kan-o…"</p>
<p>"Yes, doctor," he said while he prepared the firestarter again. He could sense that something was amiss. He tapped hae cheeks, but thi didn't wake up. There was little time to save hae.</p>
<p>Penyi's voice interrupted him again, "Kipnu, I see a figure entering the armory."</p>
<p>But he couldn't deal with that now. The firestarter was hot, and the bleeding needed to stop. <em>"Am I dying?"</em> He heard hae slurred voice echo in his mind as he moved his hand closer to hae neck.</p>
<p>"Hold still," he said, in case thi could still hear him. "This will only be a moment."</p>
<p>He wedged his smallest finger into the space of hae fractured skull and pried into the wound to find a path to the source of the blood. <em>About a quarter finger length in. Right posterior artery.</em></p>
<p>A blue light entered the room but once again he didn't didn't pay it any mind.</p>
<p>"What are you doing with Casra?" asked a maman angrily.</p>
<p>"I need to stop the bleeding."</p>
<p>He spoke mechanically without moving his head.</p>
<p>"How did…" thi said out loud, but thi walked closer and was repulsed by the blood on hae face.</p>
<p>"You can either help me or stand back," he said abruptly.</p>
<p>Thi helped him restrain hae head and added light to the area. Kipnu separated the plunger from its socket and quickly slid a finger over the tip to check its heat. He winced at the singe it created and waved the finger to cool it down, then carefully inserted the hot plunger into the wound. A sizzling sound began and the air was soaked with the smell of burning flesh. The maman coughed and gagged, walking away from the scene, but Kipnu remained unfazed. He felt around for blood, and it seemed to stop, but Casra's remained unconscious.</p>
<p>"Thi's lost too much blood," said the maman, looking away. "Thi needs kanosin."</p>
<p>Kipnu dismissed hae suggestion, unsurprised that another stranger would think to give him medical advice. But he recalled the blue light, noted that it was brighter than even Setre would have been. The maman turned around and walked to Casra again, unlocking the chains that held hae to the wall with a key from hae pocket, and held hae in hae arms as if to prepare to carry Casra a long distance.</p>
<p>Kipnu drew his dagger and stood in front of Shinna.</p>
<p>"Where are you taking hae?" he asked.</p>
<p>Thi gently set Casra's fading body onto the floor and drew hae thick black robes over hae, plunging the room into darkness. In an instant, he felt the sharp feeling of a blade against his back, a firm grip on his wrist, and he kneeled away from it. Shinna was atop him now, holding his blade arm out and his torso to the ground.</p>
<p>"The next time you try to pull a blade on me, you'll never see daylight again."</p>
<p>Kipnu struggled to break free, but was not in a position to do so. He dropped the dagger, sensing that it was his only way out of this situation, and Shinna kicked it aside.</p>
<p>"The underworld is the only way Casra will survive," Shinna said. "You can either help me or stand back."</p>
<p>Thi let go of him, and went back to Casra.</p>
<p>"Why are you helping hae all of a sudden?"</p>
<p>"Hope fits snugly under my toe. It is a small, fickle thing. But life? Life is far too big a thing to crush - even for a wicked bastard like me."</p>
<p>Thi lifted Casra up and out of the basement with ease, looking back at Kipnu.</p>
<p>"You're a meager little pawn, Kipnu. You're in a war you know nothing about. Never forget: you're my meager little pawn."</p>
<p>Shinna lifted haeself out of the hole and carried Casra through that bustling crowd of revolutionaries, none of them stopping hae or knowing who these two maman were. Thi left through the main fissure and turned hae path toward the cold dark night with only a promise of Casra's safety.</p>
<p>Kipnu lifted himself out of the hole, caught his breath in the armory amongst the clamor of people scrambling for more antikan and spears. A pair of anomin lanterns had been lit but the air was not filled with their sweet smell, but the smell of smoke. He looked for Fanla, but couldn't find her. Nor did he find Ginnu.</p>
<p>Penyi came upon the listener again. "Fire. There's a fire at the Pavilion!"</p>
<p>An overwhelming feeling of dread overcame him, but running was not an option. Setre was still at the pavilion, keeping the guardians off, and even more were treating the sick. His feet pushed the ground beneath him, and out into the cold night.</p>
<p>Some people were rushing out of the pavilion carrying limp bodies. Others were paired together, carrying crates of fish or kelp. Most were standing at a safe distance staring in horror at the sight of their home burning down. Adjacent to the armory, he saw a group of bodies laying on the ground and some people from his group attending to them. Some of them were stirring, and others were not. His eye caught Fanla who stood before several people lying on the ground with soot all over their bodies. He ran toward her, dodging a flurry of people from every direction.</p>
<p>"Fanla! What's going on?" he asked her. Another woman came out of the burning pavilion, carrying two guardians on her shoulders, and set them gently on the ground next to the others.</p>
<p>"We're pulling people out of the pavilion. I need your help."</p>
<p>"Where is Setre?" he asked.</p>
<p>But she didn't know. "Kipnu, these people aren't breathing," thi insisted. "What do we do?"</p>
<p>"If they still have a pulse, press on their chest until they start coughing. Otherwise move on to the next person."</p>
<p>Fanla looked at him, understanding what he was asking her to do but mentally unprepared to do it.</p>
<p>As much as she needed someone to help revive them, he didn't have time. Setre was still in the fire.</p>
<p>A dark smoke hung in the air as he ran into the inferno. Everywhere around him the heat of infrared light alighted upon his cheeks and hands, the rumble roared in his ears, exercising vengeance against the darkness. Ahead of him, there were yells that could scarcely be heard through the fire and spears strewn on the ground as if in a hurry, but there was no sign of Setre.</p>
<p>He called her name but could scarcely be heard above the rumble.</p>
<p>A silhouette appeared on the ground. It was short, resembling a child, but through the lapping of flames and fabric, the silhouette moved and transformed into two figures. One on the ground, and the other hovering over.</p>
<p>"Do you need help?" he said to them. But the kneeling figure ran off toward the back of the pavilion, staying low to the ground.</p>
<p>"Wait!" he said, but the figure had already disappeared. He turned to the person lying on the ground and found Setre.</p>
<p>"Casra…Casra…", her voice had fractured in two and wheezed through labored breaths. But Kipnu was too busy lifting and carrying her to hear.</p>
<p>When he had made it back to Fanla, he set her down gently and began examining her for injury. The entire left side of her head and neck had been disfigured by the flames, and her eyes were dotted with starry cataracts. Setre reached to Kipnu's arm, and tried to gaze at him with vacant eyes, as if she were experiencing some other world far behind the one he was in. She called out again in a voice frailer than before, "Lin…"</p>
<p>"Linyu is safe. No need to worry," he comforted her with her own mysterious words. But her mind was still locked away.</p>
<p><em>I need to find Casra.</em></p>
<p>"The pavilion is clear and the fighting has stopped," he said. "Keep giving antikan to addicts and kanosin to the ones who won't make it. I'm going after Casra."</p>
<p>Fanla, incredulous, averted her focus, "Where are you going?! We need you here!"</p>
<p>"I trust you!"</p>
<p>Kipnu ran into the darkness, exhausted but determined.</p>
<p>The trees transformed as he ventured into the dark. From giant pillars in hues of fire to silent shadows looming over him. The darkness and his belabored feet led him stumbling into trees, discovered only by the faint changes in the sound of his breaths echoing off of the tree in front. Still, he wandered further into the darkness.</p>
<p>He searched for any faint sign of a horizon through the darkness, but he saw none – just darkness as far as the eye could see. He once paused and looked upward toward the sky, searching for the red dots he had seen in the treetops, but the sky was obscured by thick branches hanging high above him in this, the darkest part of Ulukoma. A chilly humidity had taken over the air, mingling with the smell of dead pine needles and ice hanging on his breath.</p>
<p>And salt. <em>I must be near the shore.</em></p>
<p>Drawing a few deep breaths, he recommitted his mind and started to run again.</p>
<p>A constant pulse of waves began to fill the darkness, and he could taste more of the salty and frosty mist.</p>
<p>"Casra!" He called toward the sound. There was no answer.</p>
<p>He came to a place where the trees cleared, and the ground had all but turned to sand. Looking out toward the ocean, he was astonished at the scene before him. The seawater was teeming with glowing kelp, a streak of blue light hanging upon every wave, reaching down to the ocean floor. In the sky were more of those strange dots he had seen from the treetops, but far more, marring Ulu like the .</p>
<p>Kipnu refocused on his mission. He called out again, "Casra!"</p>
<p>"Thi's gone," Shinna's voice came from behind him. Kipnu jumped out of surprise and looked around for hae.</p>
<p>"What did you do to hae?"</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence. Kipnu sensed that thi was moving, but couldn't see where. He lunged at where he thought thi was but he was met with cold thin air and the sound of hae voice above him. Thi spoke with a tone of smoldering rage.</p>
<p>"Shb'paahh!" hae thunderous voice shook him. "You burned the whole thing down, who knows how many you've killed and still you only care about Casra."</p>
<p>"The fire? I didn't start that–"</p>
<p>"I love my people. We love our way of life. An Ara-worshipper like you would never understand."</p>
<p>He spoke back through gasps and cries, "Your people are slaves."</p>
<p>Thi circled around him, unraveled hae robe to reveal all of the light infused into hae skin. It blinded him just enough for hae to immobilize him and hold a dagger to his neck.</p>
<p>"And you under Ara aren't? How do you handle those who don't fit your mold of the perfect person? Exile us to the darkness where we won't be a nuisance? Force us into addiction to handle the misery? Burn us all in a fire and make it look like an accident? Psycopaths like you deserve to rot for eternity under the blue. You strip this world of everything good and erase those who dissent."</p>
<p>"It wasn't me," he pleaded. He wanted to show hae somehow that he wasn't the man thi believed him to be, but the words eluded his mind and his lips; only fear was left.</p>
<p>Thi pushed him onto the ground, held his chest firmly under hae foot, and raised hae dagger to strike.</p>
<p>"I gave you a tree, and you burned the forest. Tonight you meet the arbiter of your retribution. And thi is far from kind."</p>
<p>The sound of two feet rustling the forest floor interrupted hae. Thi looked aside, and put hae dagger away, immediately forgetting about Kipnu.</p>
<p>"Ramne, why are you here?" thi asked.</p>
<p>He seemed as surprised as thi was.</p>
<p>"Found a traitor among them," he said. "Thi knew about the saltpeter and the antikan and led them straight to it."</p>
<p>"Your own partner? Are you sure?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely."</p>
<p>He pushed the maman into Shinna's light and commanded hae to show hae hands.</p>
<p>"See the dust?" he said.</p>
<p>Shinna glanced at hae hands and nodded in assent while Ramne glanced at Kipnu. He had a careless scowl, silhouetted in Shinna's body light, and the skin on his ankles were now exposed from which a bright blue light scattered across the ground around him.</p>
<p>"Looks like you have a rebel of your own," said Ramne.</p>
<p>Shinna responded in an almost mechanical tone.</p>
<p>"These two have caused death and destruction to befall Ulukoma. They deserve what is coming to them."</p>
<p>Kipnu was unaware of what would come next, but he felt the frothing of finality in the air, as if fate itself had reached a boiling point.</p>
<p>"Hold Ginnu for a moment," said Ramne. "I'll get him."</p>
<p>He moved slowly toward Kipnu, who had started to run but found poor footing in the darkness, stumbling over rocks and driftwood strewn across the beach. When Ramne caught up to him, he hadn't gone far.</p>
<p>"I remember you," he said a little too loudly for someone so close. "You gave that rousing speech about your first day in Ulukoma. Welcome to the underworld."</p>
<p>A loud patronizing laugh came out of his mouth, mingling with the acrid smell of stale pohua beer. Kipnu smelled something else too, something distinctly mineral.</p>
<p>Shinna followed behind him with Ginnu's arm in hae hand.</p>
<p>"Let's just be finished," Shinna said. "We need to get out of here soon."</p>
<p>"Patience leads to beautiful things, Shinna."</p>
<p>He put his arm around Kipnu as if they were best friends. Kipnu shrugged it off, but Ramne insisted with a tight grip on his wrist that Kipnu couldn't wrestle free from.</p>
<p>"Now Ginnu has been a loyal partner for countless days and nights. Though hae treachery has caused the suffering of hundreds of individuals, hae death should be swift, painless, poetic even."</p>
<p>He turned to Kipnu and said, "Kipnu, fetch us a small bit of kelp from the water."</p>
<p>Ramne pulled out a long metal tube with some sort of ornate mechanisms attached to it.</p>
<p>"And don't even think about running," he said.</p>
<p>Kipnu looked back at Ramne, confused, but knew this might be his last chance to escape. Slowly, obediently, he waded into the waves, keeping his eyes on Shinna and Ginnu, who both seemed agitated at his situation. The water surprised him with its warmth and the faintest tickles of bubbles that were released as he broke the sand below him. His listener had come alive with a strange sound, almost like voices amongst the static. He felt as if the ocean had come alive and he was headed straight into its belly.</p>
<p>The frail villi-like stalks bent and swayed to his movements, and he reached down to fetch one. The blue light was brighter than even the light from Shinna's body. He suspected that this plant is where Kanosin came from.</p>
<p>With his head submerged, he tugged hard on the vine, trying his best to wrest it from the ground, but he the vine wouldn't give. The leaves were much easier to separate from their vines, and he gathered three for good measure, nestling two under the middle of his tunic. He waded back with a leaf of bluekelp and a plan.</p>
<p>"Do you have it?" Ramne asked. But Kipnu didn't respond.</p>
<p>"Kipnu, do you have the kelp?" he asked again. Kipnu kept walking, with his eyes locked upon Shinna's. When he stopped, he was knee-deep in the water, with Ramne impatiently wading into the water to meet him, all with this metal pipe pointed directly to his chest. Kipnu spotted the window of his opportunity approach, and took Ramne's free hand, filling it with the one kelp leaf he'd kept visible. Ramne pushed him away, keeping the kelp leaf, and proceeded toward Ginnu. Meanwhile, Kipnu's eyes were transfixed on Shinna who began to notice.</p>
<p>"Ginnu, we don't have kanosin for you because you destroyed it all, but I suppose this is the next best thing. Swallow the liquid inside and you'll satisfy the craving you so dearly desire."</p>
<p>Kipnu held his hand up to his nose, sending a signal to Shinna. Thi paused for a moment, then took one step closer to Ginnu and inhaled quietly, so Ramne wouldn't notice. Thi noticed an odor with a quizzical look behind hae face, then looked at the leaf, then to Ramne's hand and a look of understanding formed across hae face.</p>
<p>Ginnu quckly took the leaf into hae mouth and held it between hae teeth. With a quick pull, thi emptied its contents onto hae tongue, covering hae lips with a glowing blue liquid. In a moment, thi had lost hae balance and slipped into the kanosin trance.</p>
<p>"There you go," Ramne said, laying hae softly onto the sand and unceremoniously squeezed on the instrument in his hand. A loud crack rang out into the air and the dark shadow of hae blood spread across the sand.</p>
<p>"Kipnu", said Ramne, turning to him. "Come closer."</p>
<p>But Kipnu stood perfectly still save for the tremors in his body. Ramne rose the weapon, pointing it toward him.</p>
<p>"You heard me," Ramne said, and as if in a trance, Kipnu started to walk closer.</p>
<p>"There you go. Ah, stop right there."</p>
<p>Shinna stood to the side of him, glancing behind haeself as if weighing hae options. Ramne continued to speak to the wind as if thi had vanished into the background: a passive audience to his judgment and execution.</p>
<p>"Now Kipnu, on the other hand. He's a real troublemaker. Came to this shithole and got right to work dismantling it all. You might think yourself a noble man, Kip, but that means nothing in this world. You and all your addict friends are the filth of society, the very spirit of Ulu. Ara is the fire that demands your sacrifice. And if you won't give it willingly, it shall be taken from you by force."</p>
<p>Kipnu had heard this way of speaking before, in a Holragi curiosity he'd leafed through on a whim. The teachings inside it struck him as antithetical to everything he believed. The Code of the Conscious, the philosophy of the first Heiko. These are the things that drove him to save lives, to reduce suffering. But now he knew what foul thoughts he was up against, and he met Ramne's gaze with conviction.</p>
<p>"When Ara fades from the sky and you've killed off everyone you ever had a chance to love, I hope you find the decency to regret it all as you die alone in the dark."</p>
<p>He chuckled a quick breath, barely a puff, and told him, "Nobody dies in the dark."</p>
<p>He stared comfortably into Kipnu's eyes as if harvesting Kipnu's emotions to feed the hunger of his malevolence.</p>
<p>"When the darkness falls and the mainlanders kill each other in the chaos, I'll be there to laugh as it all comes tumbling down."</p>
<p>Kipnu walked closer to challenge him and said, "You're nothing but a twisted drug peddler. The people of this world are nothing like you."</p>
<p>Ramne smirked and adjusted the instrument. "Not yet."</p>
<p>He squeezed the metal instrument with his hand and another shot rang out. Kipnu dove into the water to dodge the projectile, bracing for some kind of stinging pain. But a wave passed, and it didn't come. He surfaced again and found Ramne struggling with Shinna, the metal instrument gripped tightly in his hand. Without thinking, Kipnu rushed in to wrest it free, grasping tightly at his fingers to pry them off, but they held fast. Shinna was thrown out of the scuffle in a sudden twisting motion and the two men fell to the ground with Ramne's face in the sand. Kipnu pinned Ramne's arms against his back, but in a sudden movement, Ramne twisted and threw Kipnu off of him. As he flew back Kipnu held on to Ramne's firing arm, and inadvertently turned it straight toward himself. Another crack rang out and Kipnu felt the sting of hot metal pierce a bone in his chest, and the flowing of blood came in one stream down his abdomen into the sand. Though his eyes were fading and his ears were ringing, he was sure he saw Shinna pry the weapon from Ramne's hand with hae dagger, saw him vanish into the night.</p>
<p>"…prepare for ignition," he heard a faint voice through the static in the listener.</p>
<p>"Kipnu!" Shinna's voice was calling from above. "Don't die on me. Not today."</p>
<p>But through the commotion and the fickle passage of time, his mind began to slip into itself and lose contact with the world. Another voice entered his ear. Whether it was imagined or real was inconsequential: the voice was true. And it slept there with him in his final thought, as true things do.</p>
<p>"Kipnu… Melna…" said the voice.</p>
<p>"I love you."</p></div>

<div class="chapter"><h2 id="interlogue">Interlogue</h2>
<p>"Twelve"</p>
<p>My hands trembled uncontrollably in the darkness of the capsule as it lie still in the launching chamber of the Holragi space rail. I tried checking my shoulder straps and air mask for extra tightness, but my muscles could barely pull anything through the shaking. Fajro assured me that the straps were engineered to hold me tightly against my seat so I wouldn't injure myself during the launch. <em>I think he cares, but I can't be sure.</em></p>
<p>"Eleven"</p>
<p>The tumblers from all the gauges burned their zeroes into my eyes. I went over what I had been taught. <em>The altimeter is on the left, measured in paces. Stable trajectory at 8000 paces, but I'll have to use the thruster knobs to control my orientation. Orientation! That's over-</em></p>
<p>"Ten"</p>
<p><em>Dammit it's too fast! Orientation is to the right of the altimeter.</em> I spun the ball a bit to get a feel for how I might use it once I got up there. <em>See, scribe, spin. Once every Va'la. Three red dots opposite Ara. One big red dot for Ara.</em></p>
<p>"Nine"</p>
<p>The voice of a control officer filled my listener, "Capacitance: stable. Temperature: stable."</p>
<p>I instinctively responded, "Thank you," with my mask still on. But no one could hear me.</p>
<p>"Eight"</p>
<p>My whole body tensed up again. The anxiety came in waves with the countdown. I clenched my right hand around the steel knife-bracelet they had given me in the case of my death. <em>There's a reason I have this. I might die.</em></p>
<p><em>"It's only dangerous if you deviate from your mission."</em> Jathi's reassurance calmed me, but in the back of my mind I knew that none of them could be certain.</p>
<p>"Seven"</p>
<p>"Ahhhnnnhhhh!" I screamed out to fight the panic, and seethed through my teeth at the pain my whole body and mind were in. <em>Breathe. Breathe. I need to focus to stay alive.</em></p>
<p>I focused again on the instrument panel. <em>Antenna: Retracted. Antenna. Antenna. Antenna. Antenn-</em></p>
<p>"Six"</p>
<p>"Antenna. Antenna," I said aloud.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes and tried to blank out my mind, but all of the instruction that had been ingrained in me in those two days were rattling around in my head.</p>
<p><em>Altitude. Orientation. Apoapsis. Gravitation. Oxygen.</em></p>
<p>"Five"</p>
<p>The panic had turned into sobbing.</p>
<p>"Mama…" I cried aloud to hae memory. "I miss you now. I miss you more than ever."</p>
<p>"Four"</p>
<p>Through my tears and screams, the amber light of the radio toggle beckoned to me, and my finger shot across the compartment to flip it.</p>
<p>I said "I can't do this. I can't do this. Get me out of here."</p>
<p>The deadpan voice of the mission director responded to me, "Silence on the line."</p>
<p>"No stop the mission. I can't do this."</p>
<p>The line bathed static while I melted into the seat, into my mask.</p>
<p>"Three"</p>
<p>I slammed on the reinforced door above me. It bruised my hands, it didn't budge.</p>
<p><em>Why me? Why am I here?</em></p>
<p>"Two"</p>
<p>I ripped off my mask and pulled at my shoulder straps with whatever strength I could muster through my trembling bones. But they were made for forces far stronger than my body could muster.</p>
<p>This whole craft was made to be controlled remotely. To make me powerless to control my fate.</p>
<p>A voice came on the line again, "No damage. Continue."</p>
<p>"One"</p>
<p>I put my mask back on and clenched my fingers into the unyielding fabric of the seat.</p>
<p><em>This is where I die.</em></p>
<p>"Power."</p>
<p>The acceleration instantly pinned me against the chair and I felt my binding pendant press tightly against my chest. All of my hydroderm was flattened against my body, squeezing liquid out onto the seat. The rails that powered the craft came in waves, announcing themselves through powerful pushes and sparks that became progressively quicker. I had no space for thoughts, only intense force and mental shock. Suddenly, the overbearing noise and darkness of the rail tunnel gave way and the light of Ara filled the compartment. I was immediately flung forward as the capsule came in contact with the air and turbulence shook and slowed its movements.</p>
<p><em>five thousand six hundred</em>, I read on the altimeter as it began counting up. I reached the edge of the atmosphere and the wind slowly dwindled in strength until it became silent. I felt like I was falling, read the altimeter that told me I was rising. I looked out the window, and the instrument was right. Below me was a vast arc in a sea of black, lit by the light of Ara. <em>This is Palinan</em>, I thought. <em>All of this. The scorching desert, the lush green ring, the unknown darkness</em>. All around me inside the capsule, the water from my sweat and tears drifted into bulbous spheres around me, scattering the bright light of Ara.</p>
<p>"Antenna," I said to myself, and flipped the switch to deploy it.</p>
<p>The voice came on the line again, "Altitude 12,600 and climbing. Speed 27,000. Rotation stable."</p>
<p>And then Jathi interjected, "Liffa, can you hear us?"</p>
<p>His voice snapped me out of my daze and I quickly checked the pressure gauge to make sure the vehicle seal was good. The radio was left on.</p>
<p>"Yes. I can hear you," I said to the air.</p>
<p>"Check your orientation now," he said.</p>
<p>I checked the orientation gauge, "13 down from the origin."</p>
<p>"When the orientation reads 20 down from the origin, let us know."</p>
<p>I moved the outer marker dial to 20 down, just as I was taught and trained my eyes intently on the orientation ball, waiting for the reticle to match up with the horizon. <em>After this point, I will be alone for days on a path to L1.</em> Tears welled up in me again, when I imagined how lonely it would feel to die in this great void. There would be no goodbye. Just silence as we let the space divide us.</p>
<p>"I'll be waiting," I repeated his words in a whisper. "Kipnu… You were always so optimistic. I bet you'll have a few select words for Melna when you come back."</p>
<p>The lines finally met. I inhaled the most painful breath and in the most broken voice said "Attitude 20 down"</p>
<p>"Liffa, Prepare for ignition," said Jathi.</p>
<p>The rockets kicked on and threw me back against the seat along with the water droplets. Again, my binding pendant pressed against my chest, and reminded me of my family, of my mother. Of every connection to home that longed to keep me there.</p>
<p>I breathed heavily into my mask and mustered a grain of strength to speak.</p>
<p>"Kipnu… Melna…" I said.</p>
<p>"I love you."</p></div>

<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter15">Chapter 15</h2>
<p>"Melna, I think you should see something."</p>
<p>Melna stopped her work abruptly and left the incandescent lamp breathing light onto her makeshift desk to approach a man sitting in the dark. His eyes were fixed on a smoothly polished plate before him while his hands gently fumbled with the damper controls of a large telescopic projector pointed toward the horizon. She appeared behind him, unseen but heard, and he made room for her without looking away.</p>
<p>"Okay Jathi, lead the way," Melna asked.</p>
<p>"Look for a line of small dots rising up from the horizon."</p>
<p>Melna stared into the image plate, searching for any sign of a light in the darkness.</p>
<p>"It's just the sky," she said.</p>
<p>"Close your eyes for a moment, and then open them slowly."</p>
<p>She did as the observer instructed, closing her eyes for longer than she had the patience for, then opened them again. A tiny string of five dots as bright as Ara punctuated the thin yellow-orange of the horizon sky. Jathi swapped out lenses to the highest magnification he had and adjusted the dials ever so delicately to find the dots again. They were still faint, being so close to the horizon, but they had some speed to them and they were rising quickly.</p>
<p>"What are they?" she asked with new urgency.</p>
<p>"Spacecraft. It looks like Holrag has launched something behind Liffa."</p>
<p>Flushed with anger, she rose from the plate and closed her eyes, facing the darkest corner of the room.</p>
<p>"How large are they? Where are they going?" She asked.</p>
<p>The observer answered her, "I can't quite tell their size at this distance, but judging by the speed of the vehicles, I think they're on a similar trajectory as Liffa. I'll have more concrete numbers for you tomorrow."</p>
<p>Melna remained silent.</p>
<p>"What should we do, žah-Melna?,"</p>
<p>Melna took a few deep breaths to regain her composure.</p>
<p>"Holragi wouldn't need any more missions than the one Liffa is on unless something has gone terribly wrong."</p>
<p>"But we've been getting recordings of Liffa's voice every tova'la," said Jathi.</p>
<p>"If they aren't missions, then they must be weapons of some kind. They aren't waiting for Liffa to return."</p>
<p>"Jathi," she turned and approached him. "I want you to record every dot, every time, and find a way to determine their size and trajectory. Pomri will be here tomorrow morning to get your updates before you switch shifts. If anything changes after that, wire your findings to me on the private senate channel. I'm calling for a debate in the evening."</p>
<p>"We shall keep a constant eye."</p>
<p>"And Jathi," she recalled, "Keep your lines open. Communication is the only way we'll get through this."</p>
<p>"You have my word, žah."</p>
<p>Jathi scurried away to fetch some empty film plates while Pomri rose from her desk and approached Melna.</p>
<p>"If I could interject. The senate still believes that Liffa's mission is the only way out of this mess. They won't listen to an appeal."</p>
<p>"This goes beyond my family. This is about Holrag's secrets. All of Palinan is relying on them to lead the way, and still they keep us in the dark."</p>
<p>"Holrag has a plan. We must play by their rules."</p>
<p>"It's far too much power for one province to wield."</p>
<p>"Perhaps you're right. But our only other option is war."</p>
<p>Melna sighed, exasperated at how the world had come to this. "We need to find a way to force Holrag's hand."</p>
<p>"Painting them as a villain will be met with hostility. There is very little to gain with a diplomatic approach."</p>
<p>"What do you suggest then? We cower in fear, waiting for the day Holrag saves us all?"</p>
<p>"You bowed to them when you sacrificed our grain. You bowed to them when you sent your own bundsmaman into their experiment. What did it gain for us?"</p>
<p>Melna looked at her with smoldering eyes and explained herself, "Our position in the senate has been maintained through the worst of times. The nations continue to share knowledge and wealth to the benefit of everyone."</p>
<p>"The senate? You don't find it strange that the conduit has been quiet lately?"</p>
<p>Melna sighed, letting her internal frustration simmer and settle.</p>
<p>"I have to go home."</p>
<p>Pomri threw her hands up in disappointment as Melna reached for a thick felted black shawl and opened the door of the observatory to leave. A chilly breeze clambered through the door and into Pomri's robes, forcing her to clasp her arms.</p>
<p>Melna turned back to her and said, "Meet me tomorrow at the train station. Bring observer Jathi's findings."</p>
<p>"But the trains aren't running to Heiko."</p>
<p>"Bring your saffa. We'll ride to Rudjan and catch the second train there."</p>
<p>"That's ridiculous!"</p>
<p>Melna closed the door behind her, ignoring Pomri's complaints.</p>
<p>A small anomin lantern hung from the outside wall where she'd left it in the morning. She picked it up to light it with a firestarter, and tread carefully down the muddy steps, avoiding the newly formed dew puddles. Her mind was littered with worries, all of them feeding her imagination of watching Liffa sobbing, fearful, and alone in a cramped machine far away from home. The wind threw a gust at her, and she wondered if it was cold in space. She imagined wrapping her arms around Liffa to keep hae warm, and it made her feel warmer too.</p>
<p>At the foot of the hill was Laen-Laen, rolled up to keep out the cold, and napping as usual.</p>
<p>"Come, Laen-Laen. Let's go home."</p>
<p>He whimpered a little, a suspicious complaint for a freezing saffa.</p>
<p>"Laen, what's wrong?"</p>
<p>He shifted his legs a little to reveal a maman, aged somewhere between a child and an adult, dressed in strange kelp clothing and curled into a ball at Laen-Laen's belly.</p>
<p>"Oh my goodness," she exclaimed, reaching for hae hand, "Are you ok?"</p>
<p>Thi stirred and looked up toward Melna's voice, showing hae eyes flecked with glowing blue spots and a sort of dark haze. By the time Melna had realized the pattern was not a reflection of Ulu, the kaln was scurrying away from Melna and the saffa. But to her surprise thi didn't run away. As she looked closer, thi saw hae face overwhelemed with confusion and bewilderment.</p>
<p>"It's ok. I'm here to help," she comforted.</p>
<p>In the dark, she could see two hand-shaped bruises around hae neck. Her eyes lingered on them, then turned to a strange device around hae left ear. Laen-Laen moved closer to sniff and lick the kaln's head, but thi stayed unmoving.</p>
<p>"I am Melna," she said deliberately. Her hand rose to clasp haes. Thi flinched at first, and softened.</p>
<p>"What is your name?" she asked gently.</p>
<p>The kaln could only muster a whisper through hae raspy voice, so Melna bent down closer to hear.</p>
<p>"Lin… Yu."</p>
<hr />
<p>Melna filled the kitchen mantle with kindling from the garden and pressed her firestarter against it to start a fire. Linyu sat staring at the wall in the dimly lit great room. Thi gasped when thi smelled smoke, remembering the heat of the fire and the screams of panic, but quickly snapped out of it for fear of making hae host suspicious. Melna sensed something off about the kaln and moved to a large dew column at the center of the house to draw two cups of water from the spigot.</p>
<p>"You must be thirsty, Linyu. Have some water."</p>
<p>At first Linyu hesitated, staying still with the cup next to hae eyes, Melna holding them with obvious anxiety. When thi began to reach softly all around for where the cup might be, thi took it and with a small sip, winced as thi began to swallow. Melna immediately noticed, and rose to take the cup down and examine both hae neck and eyes closer.</p>
<p>"You have a lot of swelling here. What happened?"</p>
<p>"F-Fire," Linyu whispered.</p>
<p>"Oh," she said, surprised to hear a lie. "You should know that I'm a great listener. My job is to listen to people talk all day. If you ever want to tell me what really happened, you can say so."</p>
<p>After a moment of thought, Linyu whispered again, "Fire."</p>
<p>There were a million questions hiding in Melna's mind, but her lips were blocking them for fear of overwhelming the child.</p>
<p>"Do you know how you got to Heiko, Linyu?"</p>
<p>Thi fidgeted nervously and stared into the distance, hae eyes unmoving, untelling.</p>
<p>"Why don't you get a little rest, little one. We'll talk more in the morning."</p>
<p>Thi nodded and took one more sip of the cold water.</p>
<p>"You can sleep on the bed, and I'll stay out here in the great room. How about that?"</p>
<p>Thi nodded, not wanting to make any more decisions.</p>
<p>"But first, let's get you cleaned up."</p>
<p>She drew a bucket of water from the dew column and fetched a towel for hae to wash with. There weren't any robes small enough, but Liffa's night robes came close, so she pulled them from the cellar and gave them to Linyu.</p>
<p>"You can rinse yourself in the washroom. These robes will be big on you, but just put them on for now and I can tie them to fit."</p>
<p>Linyu looked up to her mouth with grateful eyes and mustered hae strongest, "Thank you". Melna led hae into the washroom with the bucket and towel, leaving the clean robes just outside the entryway.</p>
<p>"Take your time. I'll be right out here."</p>
<p>"Water?" Thi whispered.</p>
<p>Melna paused in confusion and then realized that the kaln might never have had plumbing before.</p>
<p>"Oh. Right… Come with me."</p>
<p>She led hae to a simple twist valve that fed into a wide plate set into the wall not more than hae own height. With her hand on haes, they opened the valve until a small flow of water exited at the plate and spread evenly across the ground. Thi held out hae hands to feel the drops cover hae fingers and trickle down hae arms. Melna watched as an involuntary smile crept up hae face, and couldn't help but smile too.</p>
<p>"Well I'll leave you to your wash-up," she said and left the room with the towel sitting on a short table near the entryway.</p>
<p>Melna glanced around the room and found the large cushion to the left of the door to sit on. The softness was inviting to her legs, weary from hiking down the hill. She took a second to clear her head, but before she could settle down, the kaln's footsteps emerged from the washroom showing a bare Linyu fumbling with a large pendant and the trinket on hae ear.</p>
<p>Melna averted her eyes and stammered, "Linyu, you shouldn't show strangers your body."</p>
<p>Linyu paused for a moment to interpret the strangeness of what Melna had just said, and then continued setting down the trinket on the ground near hae and then feeling hae way back to the washroom. Hesitantly, Melna moved her gaze to the trinket. It was wooden with metal rod sticking out and intricate carvings on the top that seemed to have survived through a great number of trouble. She turned it over to find three jagged holes drilled into the bottom.</p>
<p><em>What is this thing?</em></p>
<p>She faintly heard some noise coming from it, and hesitantly put it up to her ear. The sound was static at first, but she continued to listen closer as the observers taught her to do with the projectors at the observatory, and through the static she began to make out the tones and rhythms of a voice.</p>
<p>Linyu startled her from a trance-like fixation, standing in front of her with Liffa's robes and hae own wet clothes in hae hands. Thi knew where the listener had gone, and carried a look of consternation. Thi fervidly felt for Melna's hands amidst her confusion and pulled the listener from them, taking no pause to hide it away in hae damp, dirty clothes.</p>
<p>She responded, "I'm sorry, I should have asked first."</p>
<p>Linyu whispered to haeself, "Mom."</p>
<p>"Your mother gave it to you?"</p>
<p>Thi nodded hesistantly, and clutched to it tighter.</p>
<p>"Where is thi now?"</p>
<p>Linyu stared into the void of reality between hae and Melna with eyes like dams holding back a flood of doubt.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, we don't have to talk about that right now," Melna said, but Linyu had already turned away and started stumbling back into the washroom. A thump rang across the room as Linyu slammed the door behind hae and sat against it to block its movement. She picked up the half-emptied water glass from the table in the great room and and reassumed her post at the door. Melna didn't try to open the door or talk to hae – when Liffa's mother had died, she consoled hae through the same thing and learned how important it was to hold a space for grief. It shook her to imagine feeling such a heavy loss while recovering from the brink of death; such that she had forgotten all of her own stresses and focused on the well-being of this one kaln.</p>
<p>"Linyu, may I come in?"</p>
<p>There was no response.</p>
<p>"Knock once if you want me to leave. Twice if you'd rather I stay here."</p>
<p>After a long stillness there came a shuffling and then a knocking against the door. <em>Tap…Tap.</em></p>
<p>Slightly relieved, she responded, "Okay. I'll stay then."</p>
<p>She decided to be deliberate. Another prying question might push Linyu to leave, and it had become far too cold for anyone to be outside for the night.</p>
<p>"I promise that I won't ask any more questions. And I won't steal your device. I just have some water for you here by the door."</p>
<p>Thi slowly creaked the door open just enough to listen for Melna and reach for the glass which Melna gave eagerly. Thi kept the door cracked like this, sipping on water and listening vigilantly for any changes or movements. A crack of light shone through and Melna could see the texture of Liffa's robes clothing Linyu's shoulders.</p>
<p>"You know, my jundmaman…" she began, fighting off her own tears, "Thi used to run to the washroom whenever thi was upset too. I never did a great job comforting hae. The other one was always better at it."</p>
<p>Linyu whispered, "Liffa".</p>
<p>"Yes… That's hae name… how did you…"</p>
<p>Thi slowly slid back the door and reached out a hand in search of hers. Hae hand walked up her arm gently tapping to find its way while thi looked intently at her face. It landed on hae pendant and probed its time-worn shapes and outlines with the fingers of someone who was strangely adept at observing by touch. Thi opened the door wider and moved closer to Melna, touching hae knees to hers. With the other hand, thi reached into hae shirt and pulled out Kipnu's binding pendant. A golden yellow reflection stared back at Melna through the mirror polish she grew to recognize. It was scratched, but only lightly.</p>
<p>"Mel…na," Linyu whispered under hae tear-filled breath. Her hand clutched the pendant and felt the many imperfections she'd grown accustomed to, and for the first time, she sensed that her bunds would not be coming back.</p>
<p>Linyu wanted to say so many things to her; how Kipnu had saved hae life, how he escaped being enslaved and then led a near overnight revolution against the slavers of Ulukoma. But the most thi could muster was, "Kipnu. Love. You."</p>
<p>She held onto hae tightly, as if a great force was pulling them apart, and cried for the first time since losing Liffa to Holrag's ambitions. Linyu was pressing hae hands across her face, absorbing the tears while holding on as well. Thi wanted to tell her so many things, but thi knew the pain would be too great for her to swallow.</p>
<p>Melna fell asleep crying, lying on the ground outside the washroom with Linyu's hand still clutched in her own. Linyu lay awake next to her, thinking about how it must have been for the three of them to live there, how lonely Melna must be feeling now, and how thi felt a bond with her that thi struggled to describe. It was a kind of trust that thi had never experienced before: blind but unwavering in spite of it. But thi knew that Kipnu trusted her with his own life and that made trusting her far easier.</p>
<p>Before sleep, thi interlocked hae hands with Melna's and mouthed to her a silent resolution.</p>
<p>"To save Ara. To save you. I swear to follow you beyond the end."</p>
<p>Thi held a moment of mental silence to internalize the promise, and then rolled back over, thinking about tomorrow.</p></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter16">Chapter 16</h2>
<p>Melna awoke in a dark corner of the great room with a sliver of Ara peering through the windows. For a moment she found herself in that space between dream and reality, imagining Liffa at the front door watching hae garden in the light while Kipnu lay beside her, still sound asleep. The ghosts of tall grasses chirped in her mind. A million thirsty mouths quenched by countless tiny droplets dancing to and fro, dampening the noise of their goings and doings. But something was amiss in her dreams as well: a chill in the air, a dim in the light, a small annoying twist in her tunic. She sat up with Kipnu beside her and looked toward Liffa at the door, looking back at the two of them with tears in hae eyes.</p>
<p>"Kipnu… Melna… I love you." Thi turned and left, shutting the door behind hae.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" She called to hae, but thi had gone and the room was empty. She sat up and looked toward the door, still closed, and found herself on the floor near the washroom, dressed in an overly wrinkled version of the clothes she wore the day before. <em>Why am I on the floor?</em></p>
<p>"Linyu?" She called loudly, suddenly remembering hae. "Linyu?!"</p>
<p>She lifted herself up by one arm and scurried around the house looking for where Linyu might have gone. Liffa's robes had been left in the washroom and there was no other sign of Linyu.</p>
<p>With little time to spare that day, she resolved to carry on with her day and have Thimlu, the operator, send a message to look for hae. Pomri would give her an earful on the whole journey if she was late for her own appointment. She quickly grabbed her senate robes from the bedroom and filled a copper canteen of water, stuffing them in her bag, and walked outside into the foggy morning.</p>
<p>She approached the stable, calling, "Laen-Laen," but she heard nothing. She checked the stable and Laen-Laen was gone.</p>
<p>She panicked and called again, louder and further than before, "Laen-Laen!"</p>
<p>There was no answer, but from a distance she spotted the figure of a saffa lying underneath Liffa's ziyu tree. She ran toward it calling for Laen-Laen once again, and he made three short whoops to wake up.</p>
<p>"Why are you all the way out here, Linyu?" She asked him. Linyu was curled up between Laen's stretching legs, beginning to awaken. The wooden listener was still on hae ear.</p>
<p>"Linyu," she hastened.</p>
<p>Thi started to talk but remembered the pain in hae throat as only a whisper emerged. Thi cleared it gently and tried again.</p>
<p>"Tree," thi said with only the scratch of a voice, holding haeself up against the ground. "Wind. Speaks."</p>
<p>"I was so worried where you had gone."</p>
<p>"Why?" thi asked, and surprised her.</p>
<p>"Because you're… alone and blind. And I have no clue where your parents are and you can't call for help."</p>
<p>"Am. Fine," thi said with conviction. Melna's preplexion was renewed. Such an independent child could surely not have come from Heiko. <em>But then how did thi get here?</em>, she thought.</p>
<p>"Well, anyway, I need to take Laen on a big trip to Shaki today."</p>
<p>"Sha. Ki?"</p>
<p>"Yes. It's quite far and there are a few things I must attend to there, so I might not be back for a while. I know someone in the city who can look after you while I'm gone."</p>
<p>"With. You," thi said.</p>
<p>"You want to go with me?"</p>
<p>Thi nodded earnestly in boundless appreciation of the clarity of a plan and a person to trust, but Linyu had no way to tell her and Melna would never have understood.</p>
<p>"No. It's much too dangerous. It's better if you stay here with Thimlu at the observatory."</p>
<p>Thi stood up now and approached her. "With. You," thi insisted.</p>
<p>She didn't have the time to argue, and thought it might be good to understand more about this mysterious child with a listening device. She stooped to hae height and placed her hands on hae shoulders.</p>
<p>"I don't know how much you remember or know about the world right now, but I need you to understand something if you're going to be traveling with me. I am a fidelant from Heiko. Do you know what a fidelant is?"</p>
<p>Thi furrowed hae brow, and Melna was surprised.</p>
<p>"It means I travel to a big room where all the provinces of the world discuss things, and I represent the people who live here. In that room, a few days ago, I was accused of hoarding food, and I had to give away some of my province's grain. A lot of people aren't happy about that, so we must keep a low profile to avoid danger. That means we have to stick together and stay out of trouble. You understand?"</p>
<p>Thi nodded back.</p>
<p>"Good. Now we don't have much time so let's eat up to prepare. Just follow wherever Laen goes and you'll be safe," she told hae. She ambled across the path and down a shallow slope toward the garden to fetch whatever vegetables might be waiting there, the saffa in toe with Linyu's hand glued tight to his rib.</p>
<p>"You like those, right Laen?" Melna asked him, pointing at the vast plot of pohua. He sniffed the stems, hungry but patient.</p>
<p>"Let's find you a couple big ones…"</p>
<p>She entered a row at a low point in the field and dug at the root of one plant.</p>
<p>"This one seems pretty healthy even in the cold," she said to herself.</p>
<p>The girthy root began to taper in the soil, and she pulled easily on the stems to liberate it from the ground. She hadn't worked the soil since her childhood, as her stance and dress might suggest, but a fidelant was always ready for anything, including the care of her saffa. A few more and and she stored them in her bag for later, leaving two in her hands for now.</p>
<p>She handed them to Linyu and said, "Here, feed these to Laen-Laen."</p>
<p>Thi held them out one at a time and a gentle mouth lifted them from hae hands and chomped down, splashing droplets of a sweet yellow liquid all over. The sweet aroma of fresh pohua and not-so-fresh saffa breath filled their noses.</p>
<p>Melna took this time to find something that she and Linyu could eat, but everything else had seemed to be wilting under the low-light. With each row she checked, her panic mounted. She wondered how many people had moved their plots closer to Ara or faced the same problems.</p>
<p>"Our grain stores are practically empty from ration sharing," she tol a disappointe Linyu. "I guess we'll have to get something to eat in town. The quicker we ride out there, the quicker we get to eat."</p>
<p>She led them to the stable where she fetched a thick linen riding cloth and wrapped it securely around Laen-Lean's back and chest. Once he had finished with his breakfast, he hummed in satisfaction as he sniffed around for scraps that might have fallen between his teeth.</p>
<p>"Here," she said to Linyu, stooping to fetch a small but durable travel bag. "Keep this with you. It's made of mycose, so it's waterproof and keeps its shape well. It's great for storing food."</p>
<p>With a firm grab of his neck hair, she hopped onto Laen's back and settled herself into the forward-leaning position, a little further back than she was used to.</p>
<p>"Come on," she said, holding her arms out to Linyu, "I'll pull you up."</p>
<p>And with a firm grip she lifted hae up to sit in front of her.</p>
<p>"Alright, Laen-Laen. To the station, but steady."</p>
<p>He started walking, still licking his teeth and clearly not focused on the path while Linyu got in some last bits of sleep and Melna focused her mind to the day ahead. Putting pressure on Holrag while they held ultimate power in the senate was a nearly impossible task, but it had to be done.</p>
<p>The station would have been quiet and empty, were it not for a couple of mechanics resting in the corner near the entrance and the old station attendant who found some solace in being there. The ground near the tracks had notices painted on, "No Trains – Provincial Travel Lockdown", in big white lettering, barely visible through the fog-diffused light of Ara. The breath of Ulu loitered in the still air, a sign of an end to morning winds in Heiko.</p>
<p>She strained her eyes to look for Pomri in case she had been waiting elsewhere. The echoes of her voice bounced off of the walls, absent of any people to muffle them.</p>
<p>"Guess I'm not the only late one," she said to herself.</p>
<p>Laen-Laen stooped down, letting her gently off his back. She patted the saffa's cheek and turned to Linyu.</p>
<p>"Stay here, Linyu. I'll be right back."</p>
<p>She approached the station attendant wearing an impeccable posture in lieu of her robes.</p>
<p>She greeted him, "Hi there. Do you know if this is when the train typically arrives?"</p>
<p>He gave her a once-over and said, "I'm afraid there are no trains anymore. No thanks to you."</p>
<p>"I'm just looking for the time," she persisted.</p>
<p>He looked behind her and quickly walked away, ending the conversation. The mechanics from the corner were approaching slowly with a swagger meant to intimidate: a young man in uniform who looked like he hadn't slept the night before and a maman about his height and build, twiddling with a steel bar fashioned with a crook at the end. The attendant whisked himself away, eager to stay out of trouble.</p>
<p>"You look familiar," said the maman. Hae eyes shot toward Melna's bag where her hastily-packed robes were peeking out.</p>
<p>"You're the one who gave away all our food."</p>
<p>Melna suddenly felt her muscles tighten and she glanced back at Laen-Laen who wasn't paying attention to them.</p>
<p>"Wonder if you kept any for yourself," thi said, and thi lunged for her bag. Melna just barely pulled it away from hae fingers, but as she turned to run she felt the cold touch of a steel bar across her throat. She tried to turn around, but the man held his arm against her shoulder to keep her down.</p>
<p>"I have no food," she pleaded, "Only robes and water."</p>
<p>"Your saffa will do", the man said, looking at Laen-Laen. "Call it over."</p>
<p>"You would kill a saffa to eat?"</p>
<p>"We don't have the luxury of choice. You took that from us," he said in his most scornful tone. It was clear he had been waiting for this moment to take his revenge.</p>
<p>Melna looked over to Laen-Laen who was too busy licking his legs to know what was happening. She held a moment for thought, and then raised her hand to her ear and made a peculiar humming sound. Laen-Laen looked over to her for a moment and then slowly started walking toward them, looking cautiously in every direction.</p>
<p>"Hurry it up!" The maman demanded with the bar still at Melna's neck. Melna made the sound again, and Laen-Laen continued, ever more cautious. Before he reached her, Laen-Laen became suddenly happy about something nearby.</p>
<p>A voice called from behind them, "Melna. glad I found you."</p>
<p>The pair turned round to find Pomri, on her own saffa, holding a titanium spear to the man's neck. It was anodized to a deep mauve, the color of Melna's robes, and it shimmered brightly on his chin.</p>
<p>"Looks like you've made some friends," she addressed Melna.</p>
<p>The maman tugged on the man's arm and they dashed away from the station as fast as they could.</p>
<p>"You're woefully unprepared," said Pomri, sheathing her sword.</p>
<p>Melna was stoic. "Those two need guidance not threats, Pomri. Their lives are already filled with fear."</p>
<p>Pomri suspended her disagreement and aimed her tongue elsewhere. "Who's this kaln?" she asked, giving the slightest glance to Linyu, "And what's with hae eyes?"</p>
<p>"This is Linyu."</p>
<p>Pomri patiently waited for more details.</p>
<p>Melna started again, "I found hae with Laen-Laen, voiceless and blind. Now they're pretty much inseparable. I don't know where thi came from, or how thi got into such a state."</p>
<p>"And you're taking this kid with us to Shaki? Isn't there someone here to take care of hae?"</p>
<p>"I think thi might know some things that we don't know."</p>
<p>Pomri wore a blank stare in an attempt to hide her frustration.</p>
<p>"You never run out of strange ideas, do you?" she asked in an antagonizing tone.</p>
<p>Melna let out an exasperated sigh. "My ways may seem strange to you, Pomri, but I am desparate for answers. I'm doing this for the assurance that we tried everything that we could."</p>
<p>"I only hope that we don't run out of time," she rebuked.</p>
<p>"Time… Never been fond of it. A little more, and we'd use it to complain about how little we had."</p>
<p>"Oiii. Sometimes I wonder how you became a fidelant with such terrible quotes."</p>
<p>"There are no bad jokes, Pomri. Only bad people."</p>
<p>"Are you done?"</p>
<hr />
<p>The seldom-seen path along the rail line was littered with withered leaves and stems. Several Ka'To had passed since the line had been laid by the railmakers of Holrag and it showed in these old paths of sand and gravel that had been abandoned soon after the rail was built.</p>
<p>Pomri took out her canteen and gulped a mouthful of water before looking over to Linyu.</p>
<p>"You thirsty, Linyu? Boon-Boon filled up on plenty so she won't be needing much."</p>
<p>Thi didn't answer, but wore a scowl of distrust.</p>
<p>Pomri's hand receded and twisted the vessel closed. "Oh, my water's not good enough for you? Your pride will be your death," she said.</p>
<p>"Oh Pomri, thi's a lost kid. Don't take it personally."</p>
<p>"Lost or not, a gift from a Rudjani is not to be refused."</p>
<p>Linyu's gaze of hearing had already diverted back toward the road.</p>
<p>A soft hand rested on hae shoulder, and thi snapped out of hae thoughts, "Hey, you ok?"</p>
<p>Thi straightened hae back and let out a gentle sigh, bringing a hand to meet hers.</p>
<p>Melna told hae, "Pomri can be a bit difficult at times-"</p>
<p>"-If by difficult you mean honest"</p>
<p>"…But she means well. And there's some truth in her words. We're not quite halfway to Rudjan, and Shaki is still further. We all need to keep hydrated out here."</p>
<p>She extended her own canteen to hae, and thi begrudgingly took a sip, a pause, and then another before giving it back to Melna.</p>
<p>"Laen," thi whispered hae concern to her.</p>
<p>"Saffas drink a lot of water and hold it for much longer. We'll give him some once we reach Rudjan."</p>
<p>Thi leaned forward into his thick fur and held close to his back. Melna briefly let her curiosity wander back to the listener on hae ear; the things she heard, and the things she might be missing.</p>
<p>"Linyu," she began to ask. Thi turned hae head along Laen's back to show thi was listening. The polished surface and patterns in the grain of the listener shone clearer now in the brighter light. She remembered how attached thi was to it, that it symbolized hae mother. There were so many questions she had to ask, and so few ways to ask them.</p>
<p>"It's.. It's nothing. Never mind," she said.</p>
<p>Linyu relaxed again while Melna kept looking toward Rudjan, troubled by a question she didn't know how to ask.</p>
<p><em>When we stop. I need to know.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Pomri was glowing at the first sight of her hometown. The pale orange of Ara splashed its light upon the patchwork of grasses and lakes dotting the wetlands, above which stretched a long wooden causeway proudly laying the path into the city. It was rare that she would be introducing the city to someone, much less a child, so she was filled with excitement.</p>
<p>"Linyu, do you know much about Rudjan?"</p>
<p>Linyu looked in her direction with a vacant face, annoyed that she was talking again.</p>
<p>"Home," thi said.</p>
<p>"Yes, it is my home! Allow me to introduce you to Rudjan, the city of ships!"</p>
<p>She waved her hands as if channeling some sort of illusion in the air.</p>
<p>"Rudjan is a fortress of a city-state on the border of Shaki and Heiko provinces. The settlers found this giant wetland and realized that it would be safe from invaders."</p>
<p>"It wasn't very safe from saffas," Melna butted in.</p>
<p>Pomri shot her a glare, and continued teaching.</p>
<p>"The saffas and tilmarims that inhabited the area did not take kindly to their new neighbors, and almost destroyed the settlement completely. But through ingenuity, we found a way to communicate at a basic level with the animals and bargained with them to live in peace."</p>
<p>"The settlers tricked them into fighting each other," said Melna.</p>
<p>"Goodness, woman, let me tell the story!"</p>
<p>"You're fogging up the water."</p>
<p>"How would you know this story anyway?"</p>
<p>"I hear it everytime I come here with you."</p>
<p>"Good. Then let Linyu hear it too."</p>
<p>Melna kept her face forward with a slight smirk and gestured to Pomri to continue.</p>
<p>"Anyway, after much bargaining we came to a mutual agreement. The stone walls of Rudjan were built to keep saffas and tilmarim out and people in, and we would no longer form trade routes on their wetlands."</p>
<p>"The people were afraid."</p>
<p>"Melna!"</p>
<p>She snickered under her breath so only Linyu could hear.</p>
<p>"Anyway, now that you know about our history, let me tell you about the bridge we're crossing."</p>
<p>Linyu leaned back and looked up at Melna as if to say, "Do I have to?", to which Melna laughed in surprise.</p>
<p>"By Ara, I haven't heard you chuckle once since the Obscura showed up. Some kaln comes along and now you're as bright as glass in the desert."</p>
<p>She looked down at hae and pondered at the mysteries behind this peculiar child dressed in kelp clothing that life had swept her way.</p>
<p>"Linyu reminds me to stay patient. Whatever this kaln went through to be alone in the cold in a foreign province, thi adapted through it all and found others to trust. We should all be so resilient."</p>
<p>They came to the edge of the wetland, and dismounted from their saffas. Before them, a city awaited their arrival, a train awaited their board. But for now the saffas wooped and played in the water of their ancestors, the throngia looked on in glee, and not one among them in this moment of respite felt any worry for the state of their world.</p></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter17">Chapter 17</h2>
<p>A lone citykeeper stood vigil at a row of three ornate black steel gates mounted in the wall of Rudjan. She was bundled up in thick gray cloth underneath a shining steel gorget with a rise to protect her neck and an etching of a ship on the broad front plate. Her broad cheekbones and wrinkled mouth showed that she was of an older age than most keepers would have been but it was clear she could still handle a group of bandits with ease.</p>
<p>"Well look who it is," she scoffed as the group approached her, "The traitor and her band of thieves."</p>
<p>Pomri responded with a fake smile, "Such a warm welcome, Bavle."</p>
<p>"Oh, pardon my manners," she said facetiously. She pointed to the wetlands below them. "Perhaps you'd like a drop of water first."</p>
<p>Pomri banged her spear on the bridge. "Perhaps you'd like this spear down your throat, ya cheeky cunt."</p>
<p>"Pomri, what's this about?" Melna whispered.</p>
<p>But Bavle cut her off, "So tell me why I should let you bastards through."</p>
<p>A lull in the conversation formed while Melna watched their eyes turn toward her. It took a moment for her to realize, then she took a quick breath to begin, "Oh. We are on our way to a senate session. We would like to pass."</p>
<p>"No," said the guard.</p>
<p>"What? Why?"</p>
<p>"Well, you haven't told me the password."</p>
<p>"A password?"</p>
<p>"Oh yes. Every city has them ever since The Band of Thieves infiltrated the gates of Yansha."</p>
<p>Melna paused, trying to understand such a ridiculous requirement. <em>Since when was there a password to enter Rudjan? And who is The Band of Thieves? Why did nobody brief me on them?!</em>. She thought deeply for a long and awkward moment, pondering what the password could be, when all of a sudden she heard a chuckle coming from Pomri, and then Bavle, and then boisterous laughing from the two.</p>
<p>Pomri exclaimed, "Oi! A password? The Band of Thieves? Really, Melna?"</p>
<p>Bavle joined her, "Are all your fidelants so dull?"</p>
<p>Melna was unamused at being the brunt of a joke, not to mention the waste of precious time, but she took whatever humor they could afford.</p>
<p>"Very funny," she said. A glare shot from Melna's eyes toward the still-laughing Pomri, and she quieted down and helped Linyu off of Laen-Laen.</p>
<p>"We have a train to catch," said Melna, "so please let us be on our way."</p>
<p>Bavle approached the saffa while she continued with her friend, "Oh I've missed your ugly face, Pomri. Come back when you're done running around with this dullard."</p>
<p>Melna cleared her throat, uneasy with how brazenly they insulted her.</p>
<p>"Count on it," said Pomri, "Just gotta save the world first."</p>
<p>"Just another day for you," said Bavle with a voice almost motherly. "Well, the dockways aren't big enough for saffas so you'll have to leave them here. They'll be safe on these wetlands as long as they're well trained. And I assume since you made it this far, that won't be an issue?"</p>
<p>"Yes, of course," said Melna, impatient to end the conversation.</p>
<p>"Laen," Linyu whispered to him, keeping a tight hold on his fur.</p>
<p>Melna held her impatience for a moment, for Linyu's sake.</p>
<p>"He'll be fine here," she said. "This wetland is full of saffas and tasty things. This is where saffas come from, after all."</p>
<p>Linyu moved hae hands to Laen-Laen's neck, and scratched him gently, to Laen's chagrin, while Melna faced him and said her own kind of goodbye.</p>
<p>"Hey Laen. We might be gone for a while. You should be safe with the other saffas out here. Make some friends, ok?"</p>
<p>He whooped low, hearing the uncertainty in her tone, but understanding that there were some things she had to do that wouldn't be as fun. She nuzzled him despite his fishy breath and then reached out to Linyu to draw hae away. Pomri finished her own quiet goodbye to Boon-Boon and then led the two down a ramp to a small group of other saffa perched just outside the gate.</p>
<p>"Love. you," Linyu whispered to the air. Laen's scent still lingered in hae nose.</p>
<p>They returned to the center gate to find Bavle kneeling down in front of a small hole in the ground. She produced a short sword with a brass scabbard decorated with peculiar nubbins and grooves and firmly thrust it into the hole. With a loud hiss and a cloud of steam, the gate began to open before them.</p>
<p>"You three keep a watchful eye," she warned them. "All sorts of trouble has been brewing lately."</p>
<p>"Thank you for letting us know. We'll be vigilant," said Melna. Her curious eye pulled her focus toward the woman's clothes, catching a glimpse of a healing wound on her chest. Melna knew now that her words were more serious than her tone suggested.</p>
<p>"Bavle, will you be–"</p>
<p>"Shush," she said. "My place is to protect this gate. Neither fear of death nor promise of reward can take me from it."</p>
<p>"I see," said Melna.</p>
<p>Pomri approached and rose her left arm to Bavle, who hooked her own around it. They stood staring at each other for a moment in solidarity and then loosened their stances to let each other go. Following behind Pomri, Melna bowed in silent respect before bidding farewell to the keeper who had already turned to close the gate. Linyu's blind stare lingered on Bavle in wonder about her face, her story, or whether thi could trust her. But Melna peered into hae blue eyes, and scratched a bit at hae back.</p>
<p>"She'll be ok," she said.</p>
<p>The city opened upon a wide pier of a bustling market full of merchants on small ships. Their bows rose into large upward arcs that narrowed and curled above their heads. From each one, a pendulating brass oil lanterns hung, sending the sweet piny fragrance of anomin smoke into the air. To Melna the boats looked like some sort of firebreathing spirits of the sea, come to join with Rudjani society.</p>
<p>Beyond the pier, an island of tall trees and ruddy lichens supported a great wooden tower. The architecture seemed quite old, from before the discovery of steel in Holrag, but there were clear signs of new wood alongside the old over the years. Melna spotted this pattern in other buildings and imagined that the entire city had been completely replaced over countless generations of throngian history, but that nobody could say for sure.</p>
<p>She paused to take in the sights of this golden city she had only been to but a few times. The city she remembered had more color, with the white light of Ara complimenting the amber glow of the lanterns, filling everything with a sort of warmth. Today, their faces were painted in silhouettes and firelight, though none of them seemed to mind it at all.</p>
<p>"Hey Linyu, have some of this," yelled Pomri from the side of the pier. She had already bought some grilled shellfish on a stick to eat and handed Linyu a skewer of hae own. Hae face showed appreciation instead of reluctance.</p>
<p>"I'm not buyin' for you," she told Melna parenthetically.</p>
<p>"I'm not surprised."</p>
<p>Melna approached a row of merchants selling a myriad of items from the sea or the wetlands.</p>
<p>A man on a steel-clad boat called out to her, "Aye aren't you a beauty. Girl like you could use a pearl or two."</p>
<p>If Melna were just a few Na'to younger she might have found such a compliment endearing, but with age she'd learned to simply indulge in such empty compliments and spend her Shaki money elsewhere.</p>
<p>She approached a fisher's boat where she spotted a grain barrel and asked the maman, "Do you have flatbread?"</p>
<p>Thi replied, "Aye. Make 'em fresh too."</p>
<p>"I'll have six and whatever fish you suggest."</p>
<p>"Alright then. We caught a lot of semah today. Fresh and extra colorful," thi reached into a barrel submerged in the water and pulled out a red fish that was a bit larger than the size of hae hand.</p>
<p>"Do you want it cooked?" thi asked.</p>
<p>Melna was taken aback by the sight for a moment by the thought of death.</p>
<p>"Yes." she replied, not moving her eyes from the fish.</p>
<p>The merchant stunned it with a quick slap on a pipe and gracefully removed its scales and innards. Within seconds, thi had set it onto a larger pipe behind hae that looked to be part of the city itself. Surprisingly, the fish started to sizzle right when it hit the metal.</p>
<p>From a clay pot, thi pulled out a large chunk of dough and set it on a counter, quickly dividing it into six even balls. With methodical and skillful hands, she used a boat paddle to roll them flat, then used the blade end to move the bread onto another part of the hot pipe.</p>
<p>"Ninety please," thi said, wiping hae hands on hae apron.</p>
<p>Melna hesitated, then recalled that she was no longer within Heiko. She rummaged in her bag for two small brass rings with etchings on the inside and handed them over.</p>
<p>"Keep the extra," she said.</p>
<p>"Thank you!" said the merchant in a sing-song voice.</p>
<p>Melna was surprised at the merchant's tone, which matched every other person she'd seen in this city. She said, "You all seem to be doing well even with the Obscura looming over Ara."</p>
<p>"Yes. Well, when the vegetation is scarce, the fish seem to bite at anything. Even if it's in a net."</p>
<p>"But surely, your fish will be next to die. What will you do then?"</p>
<p>Thi moved to turn over the fish and bread on the pipe.</p>
<p>"Then I'll catch bigger fish"</p>
<p>"And when those die?"</p>
<p>"Well, I suppose the Tilmarim would do."</p>
<p>Melna was getting irritated. "But where do you draw the line? How far do you carry on until you seek survival on your own terms?"</p>
<p>"We have enough grain from Heiko to keep us going until Holrag figures out what's going on."</p>
<p>"And what if they don't?"</p>
<p>Thi stared back at her with anger in hae eyes and in hae tone.</p>
<p>"Holrag is in control of the problem," thi whispered loudly. "We must keep faith."</p>
<p>"I see," Melna replied. She had gotten all the information she needed.</p>
<p>Thi went back to the pipe and pulled three long pieces of kelp from a barrel nearby to wrap the fish and bread. Hae gestures were quick and confident, as if hae mind were taking a rest and letting hae hands do all the thinking.</p>
<p>"Your food is ready," thi said politely, as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Melna accepted the three small packages carefully, surprised by their weight. She paused, thinking to say something else, but settled on a simple "goodbye" and departed to rejoin with the others. Upon her return she noticed Linyu stooping in a corner, fiddling with a thin length of copper wire and ignoring Pomri who was trying to make small talk.</p>
<p>"What is thi making?" Melna asked.</p>
<p>"I don't know. A seller had some crispy seaweed hanging on it. Linyu felt it and got all excited. I was still hungry so I just bought the whole line."</p>
<p>She was amused. "I see", she said.</p>
<p>She turned to Linyu and asked hae, "Would you like some bread?" and Linyu's face lit up. Thi immediately put away the copper wire and she handed them both a circle of bread each. Carefully, she opened the wrapped fish and held it out for Linyu to share with her. She fixated on its eyes again, but only for a moment before she took some between two halves of the bread.</p>
<p>"The people here," she addressed Pomri. "They're blissfully ignorant of their impending doom. It's like they aren't prepared at all."</p>
<p>Pomri disagreed with her, "I think you have us wrong, Melna. We know exactly what happens when starvation sets in. Our city was founded on it, but we survived by helping one another. Nothing good ever comes from panic."</p>
<p>"But the founders of Rudjan at least had alternate plans if things didn't go so well, didn't they?"</p>
<p>"As settlers? No. They knew that their lives were in danger by traveling far from Shaki. They might not find food on the way, or they might not find the land they were looking for, or some tilmarims might ambush them in the dark. But they left anyway. Going back was never an option. It's the same now as it was then. We would be better off dead than struggling under someone else's foot."</p>
<p>"I will applaud your peoples' insistence on independence, if they weren't counting on Holrag to fix everything."</p>
<p>"We bow to no one, Melna. Holrag is but a convenient ally during this mess."</p>
<p>"Let's just hope they're as sincere as they say."</p>
<p>Pomri and Melna finished their last morsels of lunch while Linyu had stopped about halfway through the bread to resume hae twisting of the wire.</p>
<p>"Here", said Melna. "You can put the bread back so you can eat the rest later," she said to Linyu.</p>
<p>Thi said, "Okay," hae throat struggling a little less than before.</p>
<p>Melna trimmed Linyu's bread at the biting edge, packed it neatly into the kelp package that the merchant had given her, and nestled it snugly in Linyu's travel bag.</p>
<p>"Before, when Pomri asked you about Rudjan, you said 'home'. Is this where you're from?" Melna asked hae while closing the bag.</p>
<p>Thi stopped fiddling with the wire and looked away, but Melna didn't relent this time.</p>
<p>"Linyu. I know that whatever happened to you must be difficult to remember, but if…" she hesitated to push her own troubles out of her mind. "If your parents or any of your family are out there, they must be looking for you."</p>
<p>"Ulu," thi said, straining through every syllable.</p>
<p>"Ulu? Ulukoma?"</p>
<p>Thi nodded. "Home," thi said.</p>
<p>"Do you remember how you got here?"</p>
<p>"No," thi said, realizing again the peculiarity of hae situation.</p>
<p>"Okay. Let's work backward then. What is the last thing you do remember?"</p>
<p>"Ocean… Kip."</p>
<p>"Is he ok?" She asked, recalling his pendant amidst the flurry of events of the previous night. "Do you know where he is?"</p>
<p>"Mom," thi tried to speak, but hae voice trembled and came out as a whisper.</p>
<p>"He's with your mother?"</p>
<p>Thi looked sternly at her nose, staring at it with those blank eyes illuminating her face like a lantern on the end of a boat, searching for figures in the darkness.</p>
<p>"I. Don't."</p>
<p>The protrusion of the pendant under Linyu's shirt drew Melna's eye, and brought a flush to her cheeks and a tear to her left eye.</p>
<p>"Wherever Kipnu is, he must be kicking up a storm with your mother."</p>
<p>"Yes," thi said, mustering a broken smile.</p>
<p>They held each other in silence, acknowledging their unique connection and the mystery of how it came to be, when Pomri butted in, "Žah-Melna, perhaps we should be on our way."</p>
<p>Melna nodded and reassured Linyu, "Just hold tightly to my hand, and I won't let you run into anything."</p>
<p>"Okay," thi said.</p>
<p>There was a pause and then she inhaled to rise and said "Let's get going."</p>
<p>Melna led the way while Pomri took the rear to keep a sharp eye for trouble. They passed over a bridge to the first island, upon which a public garden was built full of trees that grew high above the nearby buildings. With her hand around Linyu's shoulder, they kept moving away from merchants at the gate and toward the Northern quarter.</p>
<hr />
<p>Melna took a glance at the colors in the sky from behind the nest of wires leading to the conduit. It was nearly time for the train to arrive.</p>
<p>"We must be prompt", she told them. "I'll go to the conduit alone while you two head on to the train station and secure a spot for me."</p>
<p>Linyu looked back with worried eyes, but Melna reassured hae, "I won't be long. Save me a seat near the window."</p>
<p>"Come on," said Pomri. She pulled hae up onto her shoulders with ease, and made her way toward the station before thi could object.</p>
<p>She lingered there watching them but for a moment, then with a swift turn Melna began trotting toward the conduit tower with her mind refocusing on the two observers and the strange dots in the sky.</p>
<p>The door flung open just before she could reach for it and a large man with disheveled robes appeared in the doorway. His face held no expression as he glanced in the direction of the train station, but the sweat on his neck and ears told a story of frustration. Melna noticed that his boots were peculiar. A thickly wound and thickly-grown kelp fabric covered his feet. It wasn't an exact match to Linyu's dusty shirt, but it bore a resemblance she couldn't ignore.</p>
<p>With a loud and quick huff he took off without looking, barrelling straight into Melna and paying her no mind as he kept his path. She looked back at him, incredulous, and said, "Mind yourself!"</p>
<p>But there was no response in either eye or stride. She quickly measured her options and decided that she had just enough time to follow him to at least the center of the city. She could always get word from the observatory from Shaki, and she was suspicious that there was something brewing that an angry man like him could divulge.</p>
<p>She placed her steps as quickly as possible, trying to keep up as they entered a crowded islet near the center of the city. He seemed to move through the crowd without causing a stir, seeing openings in the chaos before they formed. A couple times, she thought she had lost him, but his messy robes made him easy to spot. They had nearly reached the pier to North Harbor before he turned south onto a small dock and slowed his pace to look for boats. Melna immediately took a position hiding behind a large wooden column as she looked on.</p>
<p>"The magistrate hasn't seen them in Shaki either," he said as he approached a boat. <em>Was he speaking to someone?</em></p>
<p>"They must have gone to Heiko, it's the only place left."</p>
<p>Melna could barely make out the whispers of a response, but the boat seemed empty as far as she could tell. She watched him untie the boat from the dock with one hand and step in near the back. Without a pause, a rough shipping bag in the boat begin to move and from it emerged a pair of glowing blue eyes. On the right side of hae head was a terrible gash that was healing. She was sure such an injury would have killed a normal person, but somehow this maman was alive and well. A deluge of questions washed over her, but she resolved to stay focused as long as she could.</p>
<p>"Those idiots. He said the whole place will be rubble by tomorrow."</p>
<p><em>What?!</em></p>
<p>"What are you waiting for?" he barked at hae. "Start paddling."</p>
<p>They paddled off into the canal toward South Harbor while Melna pieced together what she had just heard.</p>
<p>"This trip was doomed to fail," she whispered to herself. "Those projectiles are meant for Heiko."</p>
<p>She tried to remain calm, but her mind refused to be clear.</p>
<p>"I need to find Pomri."</p></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter18">Chapter 18</h2>
<p>She knew that something was amiss when she saw a group of citykeepers leafing through the crowd at the station, looking for someone specific. The members of this crowd did not seem particularly rushed as a normal intending passenger might be, but glanced around cautiously, as if worried that their deepest secrets might become the target of the keepers' inquisition.</p>
<p>She walked along the perimeter of the area, searching for Pomri and avoiding the keepers, but after a long while she discovered no sign of Pomri or Linyu. She found a young maman, asked hae if thi had seen a woman and child, but thi averted hae eyes and walked away.</p>
<p><em>What happened here?</em></p>
<p>From the corner of her eye, she spotted the eyes of an older woman staring back at her from the shadows of an alleyway. She wore a thin ashen gray coat and hae mouth and nose was covered with a thick black cloth that was almost certainly the same material that Linyu was wearing. On her ear was a listener much like Linyu's. Melna planned her next steps carefully, checking every corner and vantage point in the area, and all the while the woman's gaze did not move.</p>
<p>"You are looking for someone?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Yes. A woman and a kaln. Have you seen them?"</p>
<p>"You have a pendant. Show me."</p>
<p>"My pendant? Whatever for?"</p>
<p>She remained silent, staring at Melna with the eyes of a woman who wasn't used to being distrustful.</p>
<p>Melna stood confidently and said, "I am Melna um Heiko. I am bound to Kipnu and Liffa and I don't need to show my most valued traditional heirloom to prove that to some thief. Now please tell me if you know where they've gone or I shall be on my-"</p>
<p>"Come with me," she interrupted, and turned down the wooden alley they stood in. Melna was exasperated. If not for her utter lack of any other leads, she would have turned around and left. But there was something about this woman; like the crucial piece of a puzzle, there was no way forward without her.</p>
<p>"Wait, who are you?" Melna asked as she caught up with hae.</p>
<p>"My name is Fanla," she said, removing her mask. Though it was dark, Melna could see more of the features of her face. She seemed younger than hae eyes would suggest, and her tone more soothing when unencumbered. "I was sent here by Linyu's mother to find hae and get hae to safety. When I finally spotted hae and the woman, they were walking into a trap at the station, but I was able to get to them in time."</p>
<p>"I want to see them. Where are they now?"</p>
<p>"They've fled the city on saffas. They're going back to Heiko."</p>
<p>"What? No! Heiko is in danger."</p>
<p>She stopped walking and Melna stepped and turned to stand in front of her.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" Fanla asked.</p>
<p>"I overheard a man talking about Heiko. He said it would be a pile of rubble by morning."</p>
<p>"Even the greatest army in the world can't take a city in one night."</p>
<p>"Holragi doesn't need an army," Melna said. Her voice deadened the air.</p>
<p>"We must go after them," said Fanla. "They can't have gone far."</p>
<p>"Pomri and Linyu probably took both of our saffas, but there may be other saffas we could convince. Before we go, I have some business at the conduit to attend to."</p>
<p>"It's dangerous to be walking in the city right now."</p>
<p>"I know. I'll be safe, don't you worry."</p>
<p>"I'll wait for you at the gate then."</p>
<p>"No. Go on without me. You need to catch up with them."</p>
<p>Fanla stared back at her with worried eyes, but understood that all other options were exhausted.</p>
<p>"The wind speaks," Fanla said, then receded down the alleyway and turned onto a pier that led to the south gate. Melna pondered at what she might have meant as her feet took her back to the spot where they'd first spoken.</p>
<p>She peered down the wall of the station toward the skies above Heiko, and with her mind she reached out through the dusty path that Pomri and Linyu had traveled. <em>Pomri knows what she's doing</em>, she reassured herself. Yet there was a looming dread hanging in her mind where her guilt nucleated and pervaded her thoughts. Perhaps a more clever leader could have seen these dangers earlier; could have persuaded the senate not to give Holrag such power; could have fought for Liffa to stay here. She stopped herself when small droplets leapt out of her flushed cheek.</p>
<p>"I will find you when this is over," she swore to them. "You will have a home to come back to. I promise."</p>
<p>Her eyes turned back toward Rudjan with all its patches of wooden buildings haphazardly placed amongst the watery foreground, and the keepers littered amongst the crowd, still looking for her. She surrendered all of her worries in order to focus. <em>I need to keep a low profile until I'm gone.</em> She loosened her black shawl and raised it above her head to form a makeshift hood, and tightened it again around her neck. With a quick glance and a first step she headed back to the conduit to get some answers.</p>
<p>Her feet retraced her steps down the pathway toward the conduit building, recalling her run-in with the strange man, and that eerie look of malice in his eyes. Somehow that man knew that Heiko would be destroyed. Somehow the maman knew right where Pomri and Linyu would be, knew to wait for her. There was some sort of network of information that was right under her nose, and she was determined to get to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>"Aey?" she called, but there was no answer. At the operator desk sat a man, tall and exhausted, speaking quietly into the microphone. He glanced at her and quickly murmured something quiet into the microphone and then shuffled from the desk to approach her.</p>
<p>"You can't be here. Please leave."</p>
<p>"The conduit is a public utility."</p>
<p>"Rudjan conduit is closed under order from the senate."</p>
<p>She lowered her hood and said, "I am a fidelant of the senate. There is no such order."</p>
<p>"You leave now!" he yelled, realizing who she was. He ran over to her to push her toward the door, but Melna spun his hands off of her arm and moved further into the room behind the desk, holding her hand out to keep him away. Her other hand hovered over the switch for the conduit, stopping the man in his tracks.</p>
<p>She said, "You seem agitated. Do you have some things to tell the rest of us?"</p>
<p>"Step away from the desk!"</p>
<p>"Ooh so you <em>do</em> know what's happening in Holrag. Maybe you know why they're planning to destroy Heiko. Should I tell the world what you're doing here?"</p>
<p>He didn't say a word, but held his apprehensive stance. Melna glanced at the space across the table, her hand still at the ready.</p>
<p>"Have a seat," she said. "I'd like to talk."</p>
<p>He looked around for help or dignity, both of which he had found himself in a great debt, then kicked a stool out from underneath the table and reluctantly sat down.</p>
<p>She began, "Have you ever been to Heiko?"</p>
<p>He didn't respond.</p>
<p>"Have you ever spoken to someone from our lands?"</p>
<p>"You hoard food and lie to the world. The Holragi have shown the truth. You cannot hide."</p>
<p>"Is that what the operators are saying on the conduit these days? Now tell me. What do you talk about in the more secretive channels."</p>
<p>He hesitated and said, "I have no clue what you're talking about."</p>
<p>Melna was quickly becoming impatient with him. She moved from her spot and pivoted around the table with the microphone in hand, setting it down next to her on the desk.</p>
<p>He spoke between breaths with an unwavering conviction, "You and your people. You're all criminals. Everybody knows it. You'll never succeed as long as we are in power."</p>
<p>"A Holragi controlling the Rudjan conduit, eh? Maybe you know something about why your sociopath ex-fidelant kidnapped my jundmaman?"</p>
<p>"The blood of Holrag flows through Liffa's veins, far stronger than hae Heikoi blood. Thi has shown that thi is a true Holragi, deserving of hae title."</p>
<p>"And what title is that?"</p>
<p>"Martyr."</p>
<p>She leaned forward and stared intensely into his eyes as he smirked back at her. With a quick movement, she lifted a small blade to his neck. He lifted his hands in response, but they were too slow: the blade had already fallen below his head and nestled right into a crevasse in his skin where any movement would surely be deadly.</p>
<p>He laughed menacingly in her face, "It is a fitting end for a true Holragi, a shooting star in the night sky, a symbol of defiance against the Heikoi who squandered hae talents with tradition and sexism."</p>
<p>"You know nothing about Liffa."</p>
<p>"What sort of home cages its people in houses and families, eh? What sort of home forces someone into a job because their family did it?"</p>
<p>"Liffa wanted to carry on the tradition."</p>
<p>"Nobody wants to be a farmer. Especially not one who is destined to be a hero."</p>
<p>"And what about you?" she asked, leaning in to him a little bit more. "Do you call yourself a hero? Sitting here in your comfy chair, passing little secrets to your Holragi friends. Doesn't it sicken you to coordinate the deaths of tens of thousands of people?"</p>
<p>"Heiko is a scourge on the world. You deserve what's coming to you."</p>
<p>"Your own people are plotting to conquer the world!"</p>
<p>"And the world will fall to its knees and beg for it!"</p>
<p>She maintained her scowl, her entire frontal lobe holding back from slamming his head against the table repeatedly until she felt better, but she knew this wasn't the time. His words were committed to the parts of her memory that were padded and padlocked and armored against the most difficult of truths. She simply lifted her foot from the switch of the microphone, and allowed the clamor on the line to inform the operator of what he'd just done.</p>
<p>"Heiko is a warm place," she said quietly, "Full of beautiful places and generous people. But I want you to remember this. We know when we have been betrayed. We may suffer but we will rebuild. And those who rejoiced in our suffering will be the first to fall upon our blades."</p>
<p>She gathered herself, glancing again quickly at the mess of rails and wires that filled the upper half of the room and took a step toward the door as he lifted himself from the chair.</p>
<p>When he had stood up, she turned her head and said, "You <em>will</em> regret this day."</p>
<p>"I would quicker forget you," he chuckled quietly.</p>
<p>The floorboards creaked loudly under her feet as she quickly moved to the door and jolted it open it to leave, turning to take one last look at the operator and his room before closing the door behind her.</p>
<p>What he didn't know is that she had traced the rails of the conduit and discovered one that did not emerge from the roof where the other cables did. And that waiting at the gates was a woman who could hear everything.</p>
<p>"It's Tunbe," said the operator. He spoke with a muffled voice but Fanla could hear him as clearly as if he were standing right next to her. "Melna knows. We need to move fast."</p>
<p>A man's voice came on the line in anger, "Of course she knows! The whole world knows! Why couldn't you keep your damn mouth shut?!"</p>
<p>Tunbe was silent.</p>
<p>"Where is she now?"</p>
<p>"She's–"</p>
<p>"Escaped, hasn't she? You <em>do</em> want to be part of the Red Circle, don't you?"</p>
<p>"Y-Yes, žah," said Tunbe, quivering.</p>
<p>"Good. Then find Melna and bring her to my ship once you arrive."</p>
<p>"It shall be done."</p>
<p>"Žah… if I may, I've also heard word about a kaln who can hear our radio. Thi escaped from Ulukoma through the chaos."</p>
<p><em>Linyu</em></p>
<p>"No one would take some kaln in kelp clothing seriously. Focus on your duty."</p>
<p>"Yes, žah."</p>
<p>"The plan begins at aphelion. Melna had better be there."</p>
<p>"You have my word."</p></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter19">Chapter 19</h2>
<p>Melna's fervid limbs slipped through the crowds of Rudjani who remained blissfully ignorant and powerless to the greater changes happening around them. It was clear that nothing could stop them from filling the docks of the merchant's quarter. They would sooner go hungry than surrender their sense of normalcy. A feeling of disdain washed over her for their ignorance, but she reminded herself of the law of self-determination. That one's impulse is merely the a result of the world around them, and Melna was partially responsible for that.</p>
<p>She was cautious as she approached the gate. There weren't any signs of a trap, but the quiet and the absence of merchants gave her pause.</p>
<p>She called from the inside, "Fanla…", but there was no response nor sign of anyone. She glanced at a strange wooden object on the ground near the gate and found Fanla's listener, placed gently on the ground, out of the way of passing feet. From the direction of the bridge, the sound of footsteps and a coy man's voice broke the silence. Melna hid in between gates, sitting casually against the wall so as to avoid suspicion, but listening intently to the voices on the other side.</p>
<p>"You're the 'sworn keeper' of the south gate?" he asked.</p>
<p>Bavle responded with a tone of defiance. "My oath is to the land of Rudjan, not to you."</p>
<p>"The land," he scoffed an Melna imagined a smirk, "Let's see if the land can save you in prison."</p>
<p>"Those women weren't hurting anyone, they just wanted to go home."</p>
<p>"That's not for you to decide. Soldiers, you know what to do."</p>
<p><em>Neither fear of death nor promise of reward</em>, Melna recalled Bavle's pride in that declaration and a wave of dread washed over her. The sound of an unsheathing sword punctured the air, followed by two others, and Melna got up to look. Bavle was in a defensive stance with her sword glistening in the reddened Ara light. The way she stood, it was as if she'd fought a thousand battles and practiced ten thousand more.</p>
<p>The man scoffed at her again. "You think you can threaten me with that decorative stick you call a sword? It's duller than that old head of yours."</p>
<p>Bavle smirked. "I could take you down with my bare hands but a stick would be more fun."</p>
<p>The three jumped into their match, and Melna looked for a lever or a rope, hoping there was more than one way to move the gate. She found no switch, but took up a few chunks of brick that had broken off from the wall and waited for an opening. Bavle was unfettered by the soldiers' advances, dodging each of their attacks with a swift and steady bend of her body. It was apparent that her age had no bearing on her acuity.</p>
<p>The strange man looking on was becoming impatient. He reached for something in his breastpocket but before he had a firm grip, a rock struck his knee and caused him to yell in pain. The soldiers were distracted by the commotion, and Bavle took the opportunity to land quick slashing blows to their inner legs, sending them to the ground. But before she could move to her last target, an explosion erupted from his hand and she felt a disturbance in the air near her face. She turned and ran as quickly as she could as he pointed a strange metal pipe at her. Melna threw another rock and knocked the pipe clean from his hand and into the water below.</p>
<p>"Keepers, get that woman!" he cried, and suddenly two people ran from a kelping ship toward Melna. Without hesitation, she ran swiftly away from them toward the harbor. She was keenly aware of how little time she had: the entire city was becoming an elaborate trap and like a fish caught in a net, it was only a matter of time.</p>
<p>She scaled the gates and walls with her eyes, looking for openings and niches to hide in, but the wall was built flat in every way, and dutifully maintained over countless generations. Even the streams to and from the wetlands outside traveled a torturous path of steel bars spanning the thickness of the wall.</p>
<p><em>A ship will have to do</em>, she thought.</p>
<p>She rounded a corner of the wall, temporarily putting her out of site of her pursuers, and stumbled onto a small dock that ran parallel to the harbor. A small island with a garden interrupted the dock about ten paces ahead, so she quietly slipped herself into the water and swam toward that shoreline. Through the water, she could see the passing of four feet between the wooden planks. She stopped just short of the island, still hidden by the pier above her, and watched them from afar.</p>
<p>One had the demeanor of a hard-worker, the portrait of a man whose zealotry for the ideals of justice kept him trapped in his job. He had an angry mumbling tone to match as he addressed a maman who stood in the garden.</p>
<p>"Speak, maman! Where did she go?"</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>He was held back by his calmer partner, a taller woman of cleaner look and sharper thought.</p>
<p>"She came right through here. You couldn't have missed her."</p>
<p>"I wasn't looking," thi told them with a confident tone, neither defensive nor pleading.</p>
<p>"She's a woman in fine Heikoan dress. You don't miss someone like that."</p>
<p>"All sorts of people come through here, I wouldn't have-"</p>
<p>The man. "This isn't just anyone. She could be a spy. You better not be a sympathizer!"</p>
<p>He charged in and grasped the maman's hair, but the other pulled him away.</p>
<p>"Just tell us where she went," she said, "and you won't have to deal with us anymore."</p>
<p>The maman sighed as if annoyed by these petulant children bothering hae. "Perhaps you'd like to bring these baseless accusations to the Clerk of Trade? Surely he'd help you more than I."</p>
<p>The keeper paused and measured the weight of hae challenge.</p>
<p>"This is going nowhere," said the impatient keeper. "I can't be the only one who saw her come this way. And I don't take any of that kanosin shit."</p>
<p>"Maybe you did. Maybe you didn't," she said. "Either way, it's a dead end."</p>
<p>She started walking back to the gate while her partner yelled at her, "Are you quitting? What if she's that fidelant we've been looking for?"</p>
<p>He sulked in disbelief, as the maman he tormented stood behind him, holding hae head in pain. With a sneer, he took off toward the harbor, leaving the maman to the garden.</p>
<p>"It's clear now," thi said to the air, and Melna paused as if to wonder if thi was talking to her. Slowly, she moved away from the dock and approached the maman with caution.</p>
<p>She saw hae holding hae head. "Hey, are you ok?" she asked, reaching her hand out to the maman's shoulder. Thi looked up at her with a face that had long internalized the folly of trust. But hae mouth still mustered a smile of gratitude.</p>
<p>"It will take them a bit more than some roughing to hurt me," thi said.</p>
<p>Though it was dark, Melna could clearly see the features of hae face. Thi had round cheeks and a small nose, but hae eyes and hair were more clever than any she'd seen before.</p>
<p>"How could they harass you like that?"</p>
<p>"This is Rudjan; strength and money are the law."</p>
<p>"Where I come from, the law is decided and enforced by the community."</p>
<p>"And where might that be, darling?"</p>
<p>She glanced around for anyone who might have a keen interest in her origin.</p>
<p>"I am from Heiko," she said quietly.</p>
<p>The maman was a bit confused but said, "Are you afraid the keepers will hear you? They're gone now."</p>
<p>"Yes, but… there are always more."</p>
<p>"This little garden island has no place to hide but the very place you found. Nobody would give this place a second thuoght."</p>
<p>Melna felt a little safer with hae, but kept a conscious eye on the docks for anything lurking in the shadows.</p>
<p>"They told us your government was hoarding grain," thi said, "but I don't buy it. What would a little bit of extra food buy you? You're still going to die."</p>
<p>Melna did not admire hae cynicism, but appreciated it nonetheless. "You're the first person I've met that believes in us," she said. "Many even from Heiko are unsure."</p>
<p>"Fear leads to foolish thoughts and desparate decisions."</p>
<p>Melna offered hae some water from her canteen and thi accepted it graciously.</p>
<p>"Thank you, darling."</p>
<p>Melna hesitated to introduced herself, but decided it was in her best interest to make at least one ally at this point in her journey.</p>
<p>"I'm Mel-", she rethought her words, "ka. Melka."</p>
<p>"Me'ka. A wonderful name," said the maman. "I'm Shimba, the great merchant-chemist of Yansha, captain of the Silver Saffa. We're about the depart to Yansha, but, I think we have room for one more."</p>
<p>"Actually," she said graciously, "I <em>am</em> looking for a way back home."</p>
<p>"To Heiko?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"But we're going to Yansha."</p>
<p>"I understand, but I hoped that you might take a desparate fidelant to Heiko on the way."</p>
<p>"No. It's too dangerous," thi said, seeming uncomfortable for the first time. Melna figured that thi didn't want to let on what she already knew.</p>
<p>"I know the danger that lies ahead. Whatever you think I'm blind to, I assure you, I know."</p>
<p>"Then why do you insist on going back?"</p>
<p>"To save my people."</p>
<p>"You can save your people from a safe distance."</p>
<p>"They would dismiss me as a coward before I could say anything."</p>
<p>"That's their problem."</p>
<p>"No, it's mine too. I've dedicated my life to the problems of the Heikoi. They've pledged their fidelity to me, and I to them. If it takes my life to win back their trust and save theirs, then I would gladly make that exchange."</p>
<p>She kneeled close and took hae hands in her own, pleading to hae for help. "Please take me to Heiko. I would be immensely indebted to you."</p>
<p>"And you will die before you can repay it."</p>
<p>"I assure you, you will be paid without regard to my–"</p>
<p>The maman shushed her and looked around for some keeper or spy lying in wait.</p>
<p>"You're asking me to do something impossible," thi said. "The whole peninsula will be blockaded. No one can leave or enter."</p>
<p>"Blockaded?" Melna was incredulous. This was no longer just a simple evacuation. "Just take me halfway then. I can make up the rest on foot."</p>
<p>"Do you understand what a blockade is? A wall of soldiers and ships stands between you and your people, and they would love nothing more than to turn your death into a show of force."</p>
<p>The air was still and filled with tension. Melna looked through her mind at all of the imaginings of her own end, and, for just a moment, thought of her own self-preservation over the safety of her people. Perhaps someone in the Heiko intelligence network knew of the blockade. Perhaps Pomri and Linyu and Fanla would make it to Heiko in time to prepare everyone. Or perhaps not. The thought turned her stomach.</p>
<p>"Alright I'll take you," said Shimba with some reluctance. Melna's face lit up with excitement. "I'll find some way through the blockade, but for now keep your head down and your wits about you."</p>
<p>Melna took Shimba's hand and hae face showed that thi too understood how important this was. Without a word, the two walked cautiously toward the harbor piers, looking around every corner for any keepers that might be lurking about. Melna felt a peculiar sense of dread and worry with each step, as if she'd left something between them unspoken. "Shimba," Melna began, "I hope you don't mind me asking, but why are you helping me? A Rudjani merchant always negotiates, but you haven't."</p>
<p>Thi looked at her with surprise and an expression of earnest importance.</p>
<p>"My time has come and passed. Peoples' lives have passed through my ledger, and let's just say not all of them were in the righteous light of Ara."</p>
<p>Hae eyes were narrowed into a scowl as if remembering something painful.</p>
<p>"Call it atonement, if you will. Of a rebellious kind."</p>
<p>Melna usually knew a truth from a lie, but this one she couldn't decipher.</p>
<p>"Well, shall we?" asked Shimba.</p>
<p>The "Kutsa um Yansha", as Shimba called it, was larger than she had imagined, outfitted with four large foldable sails, two to a side, and three pairs of risers for power in a headwind. The forward hull was adorned with brand new plates of steel which set the ship low in the water. But the crew didn't seem bothered by the clearly worrisome display as they played some sort of game on a crate on the dock.</p>
<p>"What are those plates for?" She asked Shimba as she got closer.</p>
<p>"Ice. The ocean is full of it now. We need something to break through the larger chunks so they don't damage the rest of the boat."</p>
<p>"Ice? In the ocean?"</p>
<p>"There's always been an ice line but it is far beyond where most explorers have gone. Ever since the obscura, it's been moving closer as the skywinds from the desert lose their speed and heat."</p>
<p>Melna was in awe at Shimba's depth of knowledge, chocking it up to one of the many things a kelper needs to know to survive in the ocean.</p>
<p>"Crew!", Shimba addressed the crowd of around twenty. The volume of hae voice shocked Melna out of her daydream. "This is uh.." Thi leaned toward Melna, trying to remember her name.</p>
<p>"Melka-", she hinted to hae, "Belka!" thi shouted confidently. "A traveler from Rudjan."</p>
<p>They all greeted her out of sync with boisterous "Oy!"s and "Ai!"s. She smiled through the noise, too paranoid to say anything about it, too ashamed to look them in the eye.</p>
<p>"Belka will be joining us for a short trip to the blockade before Yansha."</p>
<p>"Heiko?" A maman approached the two, doing a once over of Melna with a disgusted look before thi ignored her and addressed Shimba. Thi spoke under hae breath but Melna could still hear hae.</p>
<p>"Have you gone mad?" thi asked. Melna thought that her cover might have been blown, but Shimba remained unfazed, unwavering.</p>
<p>"Oh shut up, Panna," Shimba snapped in an oddly reassuring way. "Your worries will kill you before anything else gets a chance."</p>
<p>Thi shot back, "Maybe if you weren't so obsessed with that maman from Rudj–"</p>
<p>"–I'm with Belka," said a man at the back. He had an aloof tone and an air of entitlement. "We'll drop her just short of the blockade, and then be on our way."</p>
<p>Panna made a strange sound with the tips of hae tongue, then turned hae gaze toward Melna.</p>
<p>"You bring us anything?" thi demanded. Melna's cheeks flushed in embarassment, not knowing that she would be expected to bring something.</p>
<p>"Didn't think so. People like you get everything handed to you. Our generosity doesn't come for free."</p>
<p>"That's not how generosity works," Shimba said.</p>
<p>"Then what's the point?" Panna turned back to Shimba. "We all need something."</p>
<p>Melna saw the exapserated look on both of their faces, searched for some answer to quell their needs.</p>
<p>She offered them a deal. "I… have very little with me. But I can ensure an eternal welcome to all of you amongst the people of Heiko."</p>
<p>"A welcome, eh?" said Panna. "That supposed to impress us?"</p>
<p>Her mind raced to find an answer, but she had no time to think before the man from before butted in.</p>
<p>"Ah, but Panna, never underestimate the power of a welcome. You never know when you'll be running from the only place you've ever called home."</p>
<p>Melna glanced at Panna, saw hae looking around at nothing in particular as if avoiding bringing attention to haeself.</p>
<p>"Renga. Um Shaki," he introduced himself. "Or these days, I might as well say I'm from Ulukoma. So many people are fleeing to the place, I had to see what all the rage was about."</p>
<p>"Ulukoma!" she bought herself some time to formulate a test question.</p>
<p>"Do you know someone named Kipnu?"</p>
<p>"No," he responded with no sign of deceit or impropriety. "Can't say I've heard of him."</p>
<p>Shimba looked past Renga with a different sort of agitation. Melna knew something wasn't being said, but she thought it best to wait to dig further.</p>
<p>"Well let's get you downstairs," thi said clutching tightly to Melna's arm. "We're about to set sail and you don't want to be in the way."</p>
<p>"Nice to meet you," said Renga. Melna moved her lips to respond in kind but her uneasiness stopped her. Instead, she gave a quick nod and walked off with Shimba. Panna had all but disappeared before she could say anything to hae.</p>
<p>The door to stowage was more of a hole that happened to have a flap of wood sitting on top, and the stairs were no exception to the now apparent rule with its steep incline and the first step missing entirely.</p>
<p>"I'll leave you here with just one piece of advice," said Shimba. "Don't let that man anywhere near you."</p>
<p>"What did he do?"</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it just…" thi hesitated, looking off into the distance as if something might be watching hae. "Just get below deck and we'll talk about it later. There's a lantern down there somewhere; just look."</p>
<p>She barely had time to find the floor when Shimba moved the wooden flap back on top of the hole, and left her to the dark.</p>
<p>Melna found a clearing amongst the tarred crates and oiled bags in the stowage area below deck. The space was dark save for a few round glass windows to the outside, but Shimba had promised a lantern. One tiny lantern in a room the size of the ship. <em>A short time</em>, she repeated to herself to convince her reluctant mind.</p>
<p>Through the muffle of a wooden celing came the sound of innumerable footsteps; of people shouting, and machinery clanking; the well-tuned psyche of a team coming alive as they began to push off from the dock. They cleared the harbor and a subtle scraping sound filled the air outside as the engine below her whirred alive, vibrating the whole ship with its starting. They were on the path toward Heiko.</p>
<p>Melna's mind wandered to Kipnu, remembering how fearless he was through his sentencing and even in the stories that Linyu told her about him. And Liffa who she had heard from the furthest reaches of the void, still living breath by breath. She removed Fanla's listener from her satchel and lifted it onto her ear, once again searching for some sign of Liffa, but there was nothing but static. Her fingers moved to her pendant instead, and imagined some otherworldly strength hidden inside that could be conjured from its curves and niches.</p>
<p>She moved to a window and eyed the bridge over the wetland delta, still proudly stretching across the horizon as the idle train rail rested in the distance. Her mind wandered to Fanla and her clever voice, to Pomri and Linyu and Laen, and she sunk once more into anguish. She had led them to Rudjan, and Rudjan had divided them all. And now she was alone in the darkness.</p>
<p>At least, she believed that she was.</p>
<p>From the corner of her eye, she saw the slightest movement of a large woven bag that was haphazardly placed in the corner of two crates. It was strangely alive –&nbsp;not the movement you'd expect of something reacting to the ship's movements but adjust to them. She got up and took careful steps to walk toward it.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" an invisible voice pierced the silence.</p>
<p>Melna was startled. "Are you hiding?" she asked, still eyeing the bag. It began to rustle and a pair of illuminated eyes emerged from the top and stared at her knees.</p>
<p>"Linyu?" she said, but the figure didn't respond, and slowly the features of a strange maman became more obvious. Hae hair was knotted and unkempt, and hae face was weary with exhaustion.</p>
<p>"How did you come to have eyes like that?" Melna asked in a kinder voice, but still thi didn't respond.</p>
<p>Melna was reminded of the maman with blue eyes on the strange man's canoe and wondered if this scared maman was one in the same. She checked first for the presence of some figure of a man she might've missed, casing the area near them, but saw nothing.</p>
<p>"My name is Melna," she said coming back to the maman, "I met a kaln last evening with eyes quite similar to yours."</p>
<p>"This kaln… also has blue eyes?"</p>
<p>Melna cautiously moved her hand closer while thi crawled out of the hiding bag. Through the darkness, she could see the outline of the maman's body and the soft rays of Ara landing on hae skin. Hae skin was thin, nearly void of water, and Melna immediately withdrew her canteen to give hae a drink. The maman was wary of the strange object Melna was handing hae, but quickly bowed to desparation when thi realized that the object was full of water, and took it eagerly.</p>
<p>"Are you from Ulukoma?" Melna asked.</p>
<p>"I think so?"</p>
<p>"Have you met a man named Kipnu?"</p>
<p>"Kipnu?" thi seemed more confused than before.</p>
<p>Melna apologized, "I'm sorry. He is my jundman, and I was hoping that you might have…" She paused. Hearing herself say it out loud made her realize how ridiculous her question must have been.</p>
<p>"I have very few memories," thi said, beginning to cry, "I remember a sea of lights, millions of them dancing in the warm water. I remember waking up, yesterday on this ship, in this itchy bag. I was blind and had a terrible headache. I met a man named Ramne… And then I met him again, and a third time… I remember it hurting more each time I woke up. We went into a town of some sort. At least I think we did? But now I've met you."</p>
<p>"Are you injured?" Melna asked, recalling the wound on hae head.</p>
<p>"Yes, on my head. I think it's why I don't have any memories."</p>
<p>"Here, let me see."</p>
<p>Melna gently pulled hae closer to the light through the window and saw a strange circular ridge marking on hae head, but nothing that might suggest there was a wound there. The rest of hae body told a different story; There were bruises and wounds marring hae arms and torso, as if she'd been in a horrible struggle of some sort.</p>
<p>"My goodness. How did you get all of these?" Melna asked as she pressed gently near a few of the newer wounds to feel for any foreign objects. Thi winced uneasily at each one.</p>
<p>"I don't know," thi said, "But whoever I was before, I don't want to be hae anymore."</p>
<p>Melna felt her face flush with sorrow. She told hae, "Your body is a vessel for the many lives that may fill and empty through it. Whatever may have filled it before does not affect the indominable spirit that fills it now."</p>
<p>The maman smiled. "I've never hear something so pretty," thi said with a cracked voice. "I hope the rest of the world is so beautiful when I get to see it."</p>
<p>Melna smiled and fought back the deepest sorrow she'd ever felt.</p>
<p>"Come with me to Heiko," Melna begged hae. "I think you're in terrible danger."</p>
<p>"But… I've heard there's danger in Heiko as well."</p>
<p>"Yes. Terrible danger, but we can escape and build a new life somewhere else."</p>
<p>"Escape?"</p>
<p>"Hope I'm not interrupting anything", called a man's voice. The sound struck fear in the maman's heart, and thi hid haeself under the fabric of hae old home while Melna walked toward it. Ramne stood on the first full step, his figure traced out by the dim red of Ara through the hole in the floor he was climbing through.</p>
<p>"You looked familiar up there", he said as he got sight of Melna, "Have I run into you before?"</p>
<p>"So you don't remember me yelling at you?"</p>
<p>"Maybe I didn't hear you."</p>
<p>"Maybe you didn't listen."</p>
<p>"You know, you seem an awful lot like a man I used to know. Thought he was above everyone around him." he paused to lean on a pillar next to him and look closer at Melna, "Didn't work out so well for him."</p>
<p>She felt a wave of disdain wash over her.</p>
<p>"You seem to think better of yourself," she said coyly, "So tell me, Ramne, why aren't you the captain?"</p>
<p>He laughed, "Shinna thinks thi runs this ship. But it won't be long before thi understands who's really in charge."</p>
<p><em>Shinna?</em></p>
<p>He took two steps toward Melna, coming uncomfortably close to her and stood facing her eye-to-eye.</p>
<p>"But don't worry about hae. Worry about yourself. Because you just met my little blue-eyed monster, and that bothers me. I rather like keeping that thing a secret."</p>
<p>"Thi is a person. Just like the rest of us."</p>
<p>"Sure it looks just like one of us. But it isn't."</p>
<p>He reached for the bag where the maman hid, but Melna stopped him and pushed him away with his own weight.</p>
<p>"Heh," he laughed off her move. "Maybe you're one of them too."</p>
<p>"One of who?"</p>
<p>He walked toward her and tried to lift her by the shirt, to which she promptly responded with a punch in the ribs. But his clothing was thicker than she imagined and it cushioned the impact of her hit. He calmly shrugged it off and threw her to the ground, then grabbed the bag again and lifted the blue-eyed maman out of it by hae hair, holding hae face over Melna's like a puppet. The blue light of hae eyes filled hey sight and illuminated his face as he spoke.</p>
<p>"Let me tell you a story. A maman named Ginnu used to own this body, but Ginnu died trying to betray me. That damn idiot turned hae against me, so I did what I had to do. But then this demon, this <em>thing</em>, woke up in Ginnu's body. I tried to kill it, but it <em>just won't die</em>. This thing <em>stole</em> Ginnu's consciousness. It is a monstrosity, a wicked distortion of the sacrament of life!"</p>
<p>Melna stared into the maman's eyes, and felt hae pain and her anguish. Thi wasn't dead, thi was alive. She backed away, still lying on the ground, and he dropped the maman hard on the floor. She searched in the dark for a weapon, but there was nothing but barrels and bags far too heavy to move. Ramne suddenly lunged for her but she dodged out of the way just in time and ran for the stairs to the upper deck. But before she could reach the top, a hand grabbed her ankle and sent her tumbling back down.</p>
<p>The weight of a body pinned her down as a damp cloth covered her face. She fought to push him off of her, but it wasn't long before the last light of consciousness left her eyes, leaving only that sickening look of a madman's face seared into her memory.</p></div>

<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter20">Chapter 20</h2>
<p><em>Th-Thump. Th-Thump. Th-Thump.</em></p>
<p>The sound of her own pulses filled her head. She found herself standing in the dark upon some kind of metallic shell, staring at the little dots of light in the space around her. She took a step forward and the ground stepped forward with her, keeping her feet firmly held to the shell. Ahead of her, rays of light danced where the ground gave way.</p>
<p><em>Th-Thump. Th-Thump. Th-Thump.</em></p>
<p>A warm breeze sighed across her face and hair as she peered over the precipice and into the light. It was Ara, only brighter and more magnificent. She clambered over the edge and set her foot on the bottom of that metal shell. A familiar face took her hand to help her back up.</p>
<p>"Melna. It's been a while."</p>
<p>"Kipnu? Is that really you?"</p>
<p>"You're in great danger, Melna."</p>
<p>Her mouth and lungs moved through no action of her own. "You don't belong here," she said to herself.</p>
<p>"What is this?" she asked him, panicked, but he took her hand and held her close. He pointed at a shining speck of light drifting at their feet.</p>
<p>Liffa's voice cried out all around her, "Kipnu… Melna…"</p>
<p>She looked up to see hae sitting in the air where Kipnu had been before, but thi couldn't see her. She tried to reach out to hae, but her hand hit an invisible wall that kept them separate.</p>
<p>"I'm here! I'm here!" she cried out to hae, banging on the invisible wall, but Liffa was unreachable.</p>
<p>"I don't know if I'll make it," thi whispered to the air, "I should have listened to you, Melna."</p>
<p>"No, no, you will make it Liffa. Don't talk like that."</p>
<p>"I feel…" thi hesitated as her image began to fade into the light. Melna looked for hae face but it was empty.</p>
<p>"warm."</p>
<p>Then the light around them began to brighten and time began to stutter and skip as everything melted away in the white light. She saw herself a child, insignificant in this infinite abyss.</p>
<p><em>Th-Thump. Th-Thump. Th-Thump.</em></p>
<p>"Melna, what are you doing? Get out of there."</p>
<p>"Just leave her. She can't stay in there forever."</p>
<p><em>My parents?</em></p>
<p>"We're going to be late. Come out now."</p>
<p>"Melna, you're making your nather angry. OUT!"</p>
<p><em>Th-Thump. Th-Thump. Th-Thump.</em></p>
<p>"OUT!"</p>
<p>She was jolted awake by a hard tug on her left arm. A cold tingling sensation filled her body like billions of tiny electric currents as she slowly regained her sense of touch, of balance, of reality. She searched for her bearings and recognized that downward was behind her, with her back planted against the damp floor. <em>I'm not dead.</em></p>
<p>She perused the abilities that she did still have. Her arms wouldn't respond to her commands, but she could feel them just fine. She hoped that it might be temporary. She could feel some kind of vibration through the floor and two ringing noises in her ears: one was of her own physiology, a reminder that something terrible had happened to her. But the other was much lower: the whir of a tireless machine and the wet of the ocean. <em>A ship. I'm on a ship.</em></p>
<p>Faintly, she could hear some rustling of another and then she remembered Ramne, the rage on his face so brightly lit by that maman's eyes as he spoked with an inhuman rage. A wave of nauseous fear shook the rest of her body awake and she sprang her head up and observed her surroundings. She found her shirt had been torn from her body and her arms and legs were loosely tied with a strong kelp rope to two wooden pillars on either side of her. With her eyes opened narrowly and her faculties not fully returned, she peered into that hazy darkness and found the faint glimmer of a window through which only a sliver of the sky could be seen.</p>
<p>"You're finally awake," Ramne's unmistakeable voice broke the darkness, and she looked up and back to find his feet upside-down.</p>
<p>He continued, "Had me worried. I need you alive, you know."</p>
<p>"Fuck. You."</p>
<p>He chuckled, "Still alive, and just as profitable. You should have mentioned you were the fabled fidelant from Heiko. I'd have been a bit more considerate when I stopped you on that stairwell."</p>
<p>"Fuck. Your consideration."</p>
<p>"Come now, I've apologized, haven't I? You're one of the few that's had such a treat. You should be more thankful."</p>
<p>"If you were sorry, you'd untie me."</p>
<p>"Oh those are for my protection. I know my ways can be a little crude to some people, but where you're going, you'll wish you were back here with me."</p>
<p>She stayed quiet as he made a rustling noise and his boots knocked against the creaky floor. Step by step, he moved slowly toward her, and came to rest at her side. She glanced around for a pair of blue eyes, but didn't see any sign of the maman. A faint whirring sound of a firestarter being warmed startled her and an oil lamp lit up, showing Ramne's smug face and a carnal pair of eyes staring at hers.</p>
<p>"Holrag is looking for you, you know," he said. "And they're promising a hefty reward."</p>
<p>She laughed at her own naïveté. "Shinna's idea, I suppose. What makes you think they'll actually pay it?"</p>
<p>"You see these crates all around you? This is what keeps civilization from toppling on itself. The sweet blue nectar that brings such peace and sustenance to those who imbibe."</p>
<p>"You keep them enslaved."</p>
<p>"If kanosin is so bad maybe they should stop begging me for more."</p>
<p>"You would be the first to die if they could stop."</p>
<p>"But they can't," he laughed, "They can't stop, and that's the beauty of it."</p>
<p>He tilted the lamp over the ground between them and watched the flames crawl down the stream of oil and onto a growing pool on the floor. The smell of anomin filled the air as flames bit at her side, inching ever closer. She tried her best to think clearly and focus on escaping.</p>
<p>"The senate. It doesn't have any real power, does it?" he spoke softly. "The people give you the power to choose and you use that power to enact the will of whoever has the most power over you."</p>
<p>He poured out a little more and the flames began to singe her skin a little. She let out an agitated whimper but caught herself to avoid giving him the satisfaction he so desperately craved.</p>
<p>"But you don't have money in Heiko. No promise of riches can buy your favor, only the people of Heiko have that privilege."</p>
<p>He leaned in closer and pulled Melna's face to look at him in the eye.</p>
<p>"You don't know my power yet. It goes beyond money, beyond politics. Beyond even the obscura. The last people on this planet will become desparate and hungry, and then they <em>will</em> turn to me."</p>
<p>He moved the lamp over her, taking some perverted satisfaction in watching her squirm.</p>
<p>"They <em>will</em> know my power."</p>
<p>He poured the hot oil down upon her chest and it boiled the water in her hydroderm and singed her outer flesh. She shrieked in agony and gesticulated against her bindings, trying desparately to get the oil off as the flames spread across the surface and consumed her body. Her skin hissed with pressure and burst in small pops that bled water onto her and let the oil inside. And all while her burns grew in intensity and size, Ramne held a sadistic smile on his face.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a flash at the other end of the room and then a shuffling of feet. The lantern moved away from her and jumped about the room in confused flickers. Melna was focused on her burns so she didn't notice when the lantern fell and a crate was engulfed on the other side of the room.</p>
<p>A blanket fell on her and a pair of hands smothered the fire on her body. She cried out from the sting of the pressure, but the blanket came off quickly after and the fire had been put out. She looked up, relieved, and saw the massive fire roaring behind two familiar eyes that were no longer blue.</p>
<p>"You can see," Melna said confusedly.</p>
<p>"We don't have much time," the maman said as thi was untying the binds around Melna's arms. "We need to get out of here before the smoke suffocates us."</p>
<p>Melna's hands became free and she immediately lifted herself up and roared through the pain at the movement of her skin. Smoke from the wooden crate was beginning to fill the air and warn them that they had little time. The maman untied Melna's ankles from the post and helped her to stand up. She glanced back at the fire and didn't see Ramne anywhere, but had no time to ask qustions. Hastily, they climbed the stairs as quickly as they could and opened the door to a chilling wind and the dimmest light of Ara to guide them. Glass lanterns were hung where the crew had staked their claims on the deck. Melna looked further toward Ara and saw the shape of the land at a distance. She estimated it to be swimmable, but only just.</p>
<p>"Can you swim?" asked Melna.</p>
<p>"It's the only way," thi said. "There are no boats here."</p>
<p>They snuck quietly to the side of the ship and looked down into the dark water below.</p>
<p>"Do you have the strength?" Melna asked hae.</p>
<p>"I am not afraid to die," thi said with conviction as thi lifted herself onto the railing, "I am afraid to stay."</p>
<p>Melna nodded again and lifted herself onto the railing as well, imagining for a second the pain she would feel with salt on her wounds. A shout came from behind them saying "Stop!" It was Shinna but thi was too far to stop them.</p>
<p>Melna turned to the maman and in a moment, passed her pendant to hae and said, "Don't wait for me. Find a silver-furred saffa once you reach land. Laen-Lean."</p>
<p>"What are you doing?"</p>
<p>"GO!" said Melna, and she pushed hae off the railing, ensuring thi had safely surfaced before turning to face Shinna.</p>
<p>"Don't jump, Melna! All of us can outswim you," Shinna yelled. Thi was standing only a few paces away from her. Melna looked down at the water, at the maman who was waiting for her, and imagined jumping in after hae. But Melna knew that it would only bring more trouble for both of them. She waited until she saw the maman swim off toward land and then let herself down off of the railing. Shinna could see her scars now, and hae face was full of horror.</p>
<p>"I trusted you," Melna said. "But I was never more than a ransom to you."</p>
<p>Her tones were stiff and incisive, like the bristles of an anomin pine in the desert.</p>
<p>"We all need something," said Shinna. Hae expression was an attempt to be stoic, flushed red with relentless tension and unquestionable doubt.</p>
<p>Many of the crew had rushed to the doorway to stowage to investigate the source of the smoke, but Shinna wasn't going to let her out of hae sight.</p>
<p>Melna said, "Whatever Fajro promised you, it isn't coming."</p>
<p>"We will all be part of the Red Circle," thi said with a broken voice. "The first colony in the desert."</p>
<p>"How many people do you think he's made that promise to?"</p>
<p>Thi stayed silent, more unsure of haeself than thi had ever been before, but too engrossed in the plan to give up now.</p>
<p>"I am responsible for the survival of my crew. Nothing else matters. You will be sold to Holrag and that is final."</p>
<p>Shinna took the coat off of hae back, tossed it on the ground in front of Melna, and then turned around to help hae crew. Melna quickly took the coat and laid it over her body as she curled up against the railing, looking on at the busy people before her. Three people rushed into the smoke with buckets of ocean water reserved for fighting fires. They stopped and waited for a woman and a maman carrying Ramne out of the smoke. He was barely aware of what was happening, turning his head left and right, trying to find his bearings.</p>
<p>He yelled, "Ginnu. Melna. Where are they?"</p>
<p>They laid him down against the railing on the side of the ship opposite Melna. Through shifting legs and feet she could see a giant burn against the right side of his body as if the lantern oil had been intentionally spilled on him.</p>
<p>She couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>Shinna came back to Melna and said, "You nearly destroyed half our cargo"</p>
<p>"And we almost got the sack of shit we were aiming for."</p>
<p>Melna kept her eyes fixed on Ramne, never letting his new disfigured form out of her memory.</p>
<p>"And where is Ginnu? He's convinced thi was here." Thi paused for response but Melna was silent, never taking her eyes off of Ramne. "Are you hearing me?"</p>
<p>But Melna could sense that something more about Ramne. That there was still more he was hiding behind that smirk of his.</p>
<p>"A man like that is worth dying to kill", said Melna. "Don't you agree?"</p>
<p>Shinna looked at Ramne and back at Melna, with a look of anguish on hae face. Perhaps thi knew something to.</p>
<p>"I had the chance many times… I'd have done it if my own life didn't depend on keeping him alive."</p>
<p>"Someday, your life will depend on his death, and you'll wish you'd done it already."</p>
<p>Thi rose hae voice suddenly, "Shb'paahh! Don't you think I know that?". Melna could see a tear forming in hae right eye, but Shinna turned hae head away to spare her the sight of it. And with hae hands on hae head in exasperation, thi receded to a dark corner of the ship to be alone.</p>
<p>Melna kept her gaze fixed upon Ramne as he slowly regained his bearings. The crew crowded around him, giving him water and nursing his wounds and it made her sick to watch them pander to him. She stood up slowly, holding the coat tightly to her chest, and looked down at her hand, where an empty glass vial tinted with a green film sat, a keepsake that the maman had given her just before thi left. She looked out on the water again. There was no sign of hae. Just the dark outlines of waves.</p>
<p>"Live well, my friend. You've earned it."</p></div>

<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter21">Chapter 21</h2>
<p>The contours of Heiko center crept up on the horizon, stippled with the yellow-orange beacons of a hundred thousand lanterns burning through the darkness. She hadn't seen such a sight since her first twelfth harvest festival, in the time before the electric rails had come to Heiko. It was a welcome sight, regardless of the circumstances by which Melna was arriving. She knew that it meant they were awake.</p>
<p>Melna felt the muffled thud of a bag landing next to her, and looked up to find Panna standing above her.</p>
<p>"Your bag, žah-fidelant," thi said mockingly. Melna opened the singed flap of her bag and rummaged through it, finding her fidelant robes and garb still intact and folded neatly. Underneath them was Fanla's listener, a warm glass bottle of water, and a bundle of flat kelp ribbon.</p>
<p>Thi began to walk away, but Melna reached for hae tunic.</p>
<p>"Panna… sit with me."</p>
<p>Thi hesitated, looked around for conspicuous lookers-on, then chose a spot some distance away from Melna to avoid giving the wrong impression. Thi averted hae eyes as Melna disrobed from Shinna's coat. Through sharp pains and clenched teeth, she poured the water on her burns and began to wrap the kelp ribbon around her torso.</p>
<p>"Can't you go any faster, woman?" asked Panna.</p>
<p>"It would be a lot quicker with some help."</p>
<p>Panna looked at Melna with a half-lustful half-disgusted gaze that wasn't lost on Melna.</p>
<p>"I'm not your nurse," thi said, and then thi shuffled over and took the bandages into hae own hands as Melna sat up straight with her hands above her head. Panna began quickly and roughly, making sure the kelp was tight and well-mended to each other piece. But Melna's face turned red and dewy; even the hardest of sailors knew when to stop.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Panna," said Melna after thi had finished tying the end. Her face was still flush with pain. Panna didn't respond, but went right back to hae spot a distance away.</p>
<p>When she was ready, Melna opened her bag again and removed the robes she had been carrying. This would be the last time she could fulfill her role as a fidelant, she figured. She would wear them proudly, in a symbolic stance against whichever of Holrag's sharks were coming for dinner.</p>
<p>Her hands moved gracefully and proficiently despite her burns, recalling the movements from some distant but tidy corner of her memory.</p>
<p>"Panna", she called over her shoulder, "Could you help me with these waistropes?"</p>
<p>"Fidelants. Can't even dress themselves."</p>
<p>"These are my last moments in friendly company. I don't want to waste them getting dressed."</p>
<p>Thi made the strange ticking sound with the tip of hae tongue again and walked over slowly, making sure that Melna knew thi was annoyed. Thi took the ropes lazily from her hands, and eyed the quality of the rope and length to work with.</p>
<p>"Gently please," Melna said, "The wound is still fresh."</p>
<p>"Big project, this… blockade," thi asked while starting a square knot. "You think any of your people will make it out?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," she said, her voice belabored. "Holragi has a far stronger military presence. I don't know what we can do."</p>
<p>"Eh, those Holragi dogs don't care about their jobs. Everyone is enslaved to someone else out there."</p>
<p>"It's not the soldiers I fear. It's their children, their siblings, their friends and lovers. A soldier fights harder if there's something to lose." she said.</p>
<p>"I guess it's an even battle then."</p>
<p>Thi tried to tidy up the knot on her waist, but quickly found that nothing could right its skew.</p>
<p>"It's fine," said Melna, but Panna loosened the knot and tied it again to get it right.</p>
<p>"Shinna sees I tied a knot like this, thi'd throw a tantrum."</p>
<p>"What was that?" asked Shinna as thi approached the two.</p>
<p>"I said you'd throw a tantrum," Panna said louder. "You know, like a baby?"</p>
<p>"One more time, Panna, I swear."</p>
<p>"That's what you said last time. And the time before that–"</p>
<p>"And I fucking meant it now go clean up the mess from the fire."</p>
<p>"Fine," said Panna taking a few steps away, "Got a few knobs to polish down there anyway."</p>
<p>"Shbpaaah," Shinna exclaimed under hae breath, and took a long deep breath to forget about hae.</p>
<p>"You look like you're about to save the world," thi said, looking at Melna up and down.</p>
<p>"I am," she said without a beat.</p>
<p>"In any other time, what you're doing would be considered legendary. I fear that no one will be around to tell your side of the story."</p>
<p>"If none of my people survive, then such a title would be undeserving, don't you think?"</p>
<p>Shinna held haeself from saying the multitudes of apologies and praises that thi wanted to say. Thi knew none of it would seem genuine from hae in such a moment.</p>
<p>"We're almost to the blockade. Are you ready?"</p>
<p>"Could I perhaps… ask a personal question first?"</p>
<p>"No," thi responded, but Melna continued anyway.</p>
<p>"Is it fear that makes you tick? Is the whole world really fighting for a chance to live in the desert?"</p>
<p>Shinna sighed as if to prepare to tell a long story. "When I was a young kaln, everything seemed simple. There were good people and bad people. Law and lawlessness. 'Us' and 'them'. We both may be young for who we are, but we both know by now that all simple things are lies that someone has sold to you. Every good intention, every tenet of philosophy, every teaching from wise people in a time of prosperity. They all mean nothing when death is staring you in the eye. It could be holding you up by neck with a sword to your chest. Or slowly gnawing away at the bones of your starving children. Or it could be some weird dots in the sky shutting off Ara. If you were given a choice to let a million strangers die or watch everyone you love freeze to death, you will always. Always. Save your own."</p>
<p>Melna sat with what thi said, and vehemently disagreed in her mind. But she figured it was best if she kept her thoughts to herself.</p>
<p>"You think anyone in Heiko knows?" thi asked.</p>
<p>"We are a clever people," she said.</p>
<p>"Clever, maybe. But can anyone lead them right now? Someone like you is hard to come by."</p>
<p>"Heiko is full of astute planners, strong fighters, and persuasive leaders. But a truly great leader trains even better leaders for their inveitable absence."</p>
<p>"Doesn't sound like any leader I know."</p>
<p>Melna's memory conjured a memory of Liffa helping her fasten her robes in the windowlight. And Kipnu nuzzling her in the doorway. And in a daydream she wished for it all again. To relive that day and tell them that it was okay. That they had nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>"You know," she started to formulate why she disagreed with Shinna, "I loved once. Not long ago. I lost them trying to bring peace to the senate. In the end it was worthless. Holrag's insatiable hunger brought us here: blockaded by a superior force while we try to flee for our lives from certain destruction. I want you to remember whatever happens here today. If you truly believe that we are beyond saving, that all the worlds' nations and tribes must fend for themselves, then surely you will be next."</p>
<p>Shinna's attention had been pulled away by hae thoughts, and Melna took the moment to toss her satchel onto her shoulders again.</p>
<p>"Maybe you're right Melna," said Shinna. "Maybe they're leading us on. But the only other option is certain death."</p>
<p>"No. Not death," she said, grasping at hae hand. "A fight is not death."</p>
<p>"All the world against the Holragi? We'd be doing the obscura a favor."</p>
<p>A man from the top of the bow called out, "Ship approaching!" From the darkness of Ulu, a great volume of water was split clear in half as a huge mass of black steel breached the water. From Melna's estimation it was nearly twice as long as Shinna's ship, and some unfathomable length underneath. The crew immediately sprung into action, taking in the sails and stabilizing the rudder to avoid a collision.</p>
<p>Three silhouettes appeared from the towering dark and stood looking down at them. "Hoy!" Shinna shouted to them with a voice louder than any Melna had heard at the senate. But the phantoms didn't respond, they kept looking down and talking amongst each other.</p>
<p>"What.. is that thing?" Melna asked.</p>
<p>"A submersible. They float just below the surface to stay invisible. I've seen a few but never one this big."</p>
<p>"What would they need with something like that?"</p>
<p>"It's a deterrent."</p>
<p>"There's no ship in Palinan nearly that size. It's a weapon of conquering, not of defense–"</p>
<p>"Permission to board!" Thi interrupted her, calling out to the people on the submersible again. "We have the Heikoi!"</p>
<p>The people on the tower spoke amongst each other, and Melna saw their relationships. The left and right were soldiers by the stance and their armored look. In the center was a man with a lantern, someone of status, giving orders and guiding the operation. He clambered down a ladder with the lantern in his teeth and then gestured to Shinna to hold steady.</p>
<p>Shinna glanced at Melna. "Don't go anywhere," thi said.</p>
<p>"Really?" she asked rhetorically.</p>
<p>Shinna disappeared into stowage, and Melna saw a new dark figure emerge from the tower. It was cloaked in something heavy that nearly reached the floor, but Melna couldn't make out anything more about it. Suddenly, bright white lights from the giant submersible began to flip on one-by-one, illuminating everyone on the deck in a cold blue-white light.</p>
<p>"How are they doing that?" Melna asked aloud. She looked up at the rails above her to make sure they hadn't strayed from path, but she knew they would be there. There was nothing but dread in her heart as she stared into the blinding light.</p>
<p>Shinna appeared from stowage with a hand at hae forehead, trying to find hae bearings. Thi caught sight of Melna's figure in the light and ran back to her with something hidden in hae hand.</p>
<p>"Take it," thi said abruptly, reaching around her back to push something cold against her side.</p>
<p>"What is-"</p>
<p>"You'll need to defend yourself. Take it."</p>
<p>She hesitated, confused.</p>
<p>"Take it!" thi said under hae breath, and Melna move her left arm to receive the small knife from behind her. It was covered in a waxed cloth, perfect to blend with the cloth she was wrapped in. She discreetly slipped it inside the bottom of her robe at an angle where she could reach it easily, and drew a circle of gratitude on Shinna's back with her finger.</p>
<p>Shinna came forward and addressed the negotiator, "I am the captain. We request boarding to negotiate the fidelant's release."</p>
<p>But the cloaked figure on the tower seemed to hear hae clearly, and spoke silently into an instrument without pause, and the negotiator responded soon after.</p>
<p>"Only the fidelant will board. There will be no negotiation," he said.</p>
<p>"We were promised a position in the Red Circle."</p>
<p>"We will confirm you when she boards."</p>
<p>"That's not good enough," Shinna insisted.</p>
<p>The cloaked figure spoke again and the soldier responded accordingly. "You have one minute to accept or your ship will be destroyed."</p>
<p>The entire crew looked to Shinna who paused to wonder if they would really do such a thing. Melna's convictions were becoming truer with each passing minute and thi was scared of what that might mean.</p>
<p>Ramne approached them, limping through the pain, a streak of blue surrounding his wounds.</p>
<p>"What are you waiting for?" he said, anxiously. "Send her up!"</p>
<p>"Hold on," Shinna said sternly, and turned to address the silhouettes once more.</p>
<p>"I will board with Melna. I come unarmed."</p>
<p>"You and the fidelant. No more. We will search your person upon arrival."</p>
<p>Shinna turned to Melna with a smile and whispered, "See that? The great negotiator of Yansha just saved your ass." But secretly, thi was terrified that hae bluff was called.</p>
<p>The negotiator yelled "Make way!" and the crew backed up as the soldiers on the tower threw giant metal hooks with cables attached across the water and onto their deck, securing them on the railing. Mechanical pulleys dropped down each of them and came to rest at the edge of the Kutsa.</p>
<p>"Proceed!" he said, then climbed back up the the ladder he'd come down on.</p>
<p>The bright lights from the submersible followed them as the mechanical pulleys pulled them up and over the water on steel cables. Melna caught a glimpse of the submersible at the edges of hae shaddow. It was indeed made of plates of steel with strong rivets all across the hull, and not a window in sight. There was no deck to speak of, just the one tower that jutted out of the hull like a tall tree searching for light. As she neared the top, Shinna had already arrived on the tower and was being searched by the soldiers.</p>
<p>"I'm not leaving her here!" thi said.</p>
<p>"You certainly won't be leaving here then," said the cloaked figure, and Melna knew his voice like a cruel nightmare come to haunt her again.</p>
<p>"Get away from hae, Fajro!" she said. Shinna ducked behind the steel railing to help Melna up onto the tower when all at once, Fajro reached into his jacket for a strange steel weapon and pointed it at Shinna.</p>
<p>"Go!" Melna said to Shinna, but a great blast cracked the air above them and set their ears ringing. Shinna had jumped out of reflex, loosening hae grip just enough for hae to begin falling. Melna grasped for Shinna's arm as quickly as she could, and it held strong. With hae momentum, she lofted hae high enough to reach the pulley thi had arrived on.</p>
<p>The odor of burnt sulfur and soot filled the air as Fajro pointed the weapon at her head. Melna moved herself onto the tower and stood in front of Shinna to block his line of view.</p>
<p>"No! Don't go! They'll kill you!", Shinna screamed. Be she knew her fate. She knew that anyone who tried to save her would not be spared. She pushed gently on the pulley behind her and sent Shinna back down the cable.</p>
<p>"No!" Shinna screamed, "No!" but hae voice disappeared into the cold air.</p>
<p>"First time seeing a gun, I take it," said Fajro with an air of arrogance.</p>
<p>"Come, Melna," he gestured toward the hole he'd come out of. "We have much to discuss."</p>
<p>She looked back at the ship that brought her here, at Shinna, and the conflict thi held within haeself, who was scrambling to climb back up the rope as Fajro's soldiers cut the lines and Panna held hae back for hae own safety. And the crew who saw her only as a token in exchange for their lives. They would have been fools not to take it from anyone else.</p>
<p>Fajro smiled as he looked her up and down the way he might inspect a prize-winning saffa. There is no displeasure quite like the stare of an impudent stranger. But there are some who cast their delusions onto the skin of others and fill them with the rot that lives inside their hearts. Fajro was one of them.</p>
<p>"You look like you turn a few heads in the senate," he said, eyeing her up and down. "It's a shame we never worked together."</p>
<p>"Truly a shame," she replied, "I could have turned yours right off."</p>
<p>His frown took a moment to form, and then he sighed and changed the subject, "Shall we?" as he gestured with his cane toward a large circular metal door in the floor. With a clank and a squeak, the door swung downward, and a platform rose to fill the gap. Without protest, she stepped upon it with Fajro and his soldiers close behind, and they descended into the belly of that mechanical beast.</p>
<p>The inside was a maze of tunnels with opened doors as thick as her hand every twenty paces, and walls lined with glass bulbs that glowed that same blindingly bright bluish-white color. They sucked the warmth out of both the greased steel walls and the knurled red iron that made up the floor. It disgusted her to imagine living here for several days, as undoubtedly many of those onboard had done.</p>
<p>Fajro led her down a meandering path that she was convinced was meant to scramble her sense of direction. After wandering through what felt like the entire ship they arrived at a large room with rows of desks and pale white lights from the ceiling. At even spacings were flat glass bulbs that protruded from the desks, and a well-dressed person at each one, moving their hands across the multitudes of knobs an buttons on their desk. The back of the room was lined with a row of countless metallic controls set into metal boxes. Among this mess of instrumentation sat three operators with long black cables leading to listeners on their ears and microphones in front of them. She slowly reached into her satchel for the listener, but stopped. They didn't yet know that she could hear what they could hear.</p>
<p>"Do you know why you're here, Melna?" Fajro asked her rhetorically</p>
<p>"We are about to make history," he said with open arms to sing the praises for this place. "Liffa is about to meet the obscura and open our eyes to who they are. I wanted you to see this in person; to see first-hand what kind of work we're trying to do."</p>
<p>He turned to her with a face full of conviction.</p>
<p>"I dream of a day when we can look back on this time as nothing but a short blip in history. A cold spell in a time of prosperity. But for this to happen, we need strong leaders. People like you and me. We cannot stand idly by and watch the obscura destroy us. We must take action."</p>
<p>He took her hand and spoke with the odor of Heikoi grain on his breath. She felt her skin crawl, her pores closing.</p>
<p>"You and me, we're not so different, you know. We're both visionaries fighting to save this world as it teeters over a dark cliff."</p>
<p>"We are nothing alike," she said. "Your actions help no one but you."</p>
<p>He laughed through his nose as a father might to his child, "The survival of everything on this planet depends on the success of this plan. Unfortunately, this is not a problem that can afford debate. Dissenters must be silenced for the greater good. You understand."</p>
<p>She was done with his words. "So, what's the offer?" she asked in her most diplomatic of voices. She wanted to catch him a little bit off guard.</p>
<p>"Always in a rush, you younger ones."</p>
<p>"I can tell when a man is stalling. Tell me how I fit into this plan of yours."</p>
<p>He snickered amusedly. "I applaud your enthusiasm," he said.</p>
<p>"Oh don't get me wrong. I still think these deranged ideas of yours are nothing more than the musings of a man so wet with power that he's given up on the social pact he swore to protect. I just want to get this overwith."</p>
<p>"Everything I do is <em>for</em> the pact. It is <em>for</em> the provinces. <em>You</em> have been standing in the way–"</p>
<p>"–No, I get it now. You want to be the one everyone remembers as their heroic savior. The man who thwarted the obscura and the evil Heikoi at the same time. You want to think you're in the right, that people truly think well of you. But through all this power, your weapons, your labor camps; you still can't see past the illusion that the fear you see around you is protection."</p>
<p>"They fear the obscura. I am their salvation."</p>
<p>"They are afraid of you and you are their last resort."</p>
<p>"My legacy is written in steel, not blood."</p>
<p>"Steel," she laughed. "And who forged it into your rails, twisted it into your cables, cast it into your weapons? What kinds of stories do you think your slaves tell about you? What do they think when they polish your guns?"</p>
<p>"You're wasting your breath."</p>
<p>"Your days will dwindle as you clutch tighter, and by the time you've realized how powerless you've become, a new master will have risen."</p>
<p>"You will stop at once–"</p>
<p>"You'll be dead to them. Replaced by a child of the revolution, someone who promises that your atrocities will not go unpunished."</p>
<p>"You're not listen–"</p>
<p>"You'll beg and grovel for their attention, rotting in an underground pris–"</p>
<p>He took her by the neck and pinned her against the wall of the radio room to silence her, spitting to her, "You have no idea who you're dealing with. Your people will worship the stone that I tread, the air that I breathe. You'll wish you had died here while everything you love turns to ashes in the blink of an eye!"</p>
<p>Through the unproductive gasps for air, she managed to put on a smirk. Fajro looked around through labored breaths as his self-awareness gradually resurfaced, and he took his hand off of her, embarrassed that his crew had seen such a belligerent outburst.</p>
<p>A radio operator called to him, "Žah-Fajro," and with a furious look on his face, he approached the operator, yanking the long corded listener from hae ears. Sloppily, he raised the microphone device to his face and pressed a button that had been directly fastened to it.</p>
<p>"Liffa," he said, pretending to be settled. "Glad to hear from you."</p>
<p>Melna breathed heavily to replace her lost air, but steadied her breathing so she could listen closely as they continued.</p>
<p>"Right," he said, "She's here now. But it's time– what's that?…" he walked to a corner of the room, and an operator quickly picked the cord off the ground. It looked as though he was trying to hide something from her, but he had forgotten that fidelants knew how to read lips.</p>
<p>"She's fine," he said under his breath. "Liffa, this is not the time. You just have trust me."</p>
<p>He glanced impatiently at Melna and she felt a sensation come upon her that she hadn't felt in a long time. She knew that I felt it too. The rush of feeling in control, even just for a brief moment. Maybe some instinct from the hunters who came before us, buried thick in layers of philosophy. Melna suddenly felt the words she'd wanted to say flow through her mind like a morning breeze.</p>
<p>She interrupted Fajro mid-sentence. "Let me speak to hae," she said.</p>
<p>He continued his fruitless tirade, ignoring her entirely. But she took a step. Just one step; as much as the soldier that held her would allow.</p>
<p>"I said. Let me speak."</p>
<p>He stare at her, contemplating his options for a moment. "Bring her here, dammit!" he barked at the soldiers. "What are you waiting for!"</p>
<p>One of them pulled her by the arm, dragging her to Fajro. He came uncomfortably close to where she stood.</p>
<p>"This isn't catch-up time. You get a few conversations, thi acknowledges you're here and then you're done."</p>
<p>She nodded coldly. Fajro waved his hand in the air and an operator near to Melna gave the strange listener apparatus to her, while another much further away rested hae fingers steadily upon a brass switch.</p>
<p>Melna gathered every portion of her mental fortitude to protect herself against Fajro's games. With her left hand, she positioned the listeners comfortable on her ears. Across that vast unfathomable expanse, Melna heard the burdened breaths of the maman she swore her life to. The lever sank underneath her thumb and her breath began to fog up the air and mix with Liffa's. She thought of something to say, but every word in her head felt wrong, distant, disingenuous. But breath spoke multitudes more.</p>
<p>"Say something," Fajro interrupted them. But they didn't dare say a word.</p>
<p>There was a long, confused pause as the tension in the room mounted. Fajro reached for the listener, but Melna turned out of his way and held her hand out to fend against him.</p>
<p>She said that "The wind speaks."</p>
<p>And I told her that "Ulukoma listens."</p>
<p>A soldier that had led her there pried the listener off of Melna's head, her fingers off the microphone lever while she fought to remain on the line. She got a finger onto the microphone as it lay on the floor. "Liffa!" she cried, but the soldier had already gotten a hand on her leg and was pulling her back. An operator gathered the microphone and listener from the floor and held them up to Fajro, hae head down in submission.</p>
<p>"Why did you wait to stop her?" he growled at hae. Impatiently, he took the listener and microphone, not once looking hae in the eye. The operator's hands had an almost imperceptible tremble to them as thi grasped onto hae seat and sank into it. Melna could see the anguish in hae posture, the avoidant focus of the other two operators. <em>How could a team like this accomplish anything?</em></p>
<p>Fajro gestured to a man with thick gloves on at the far side of the room, and he approached, reaching carefully into a bag for a length of razor vine. Melna fought to free herself from the clutches of the soldier, but she was stopped with a foot on her back, pressing her burns against the floor. The man loosely wrapped the vine around her neck while she fought to avoid him. The stinging needles pierced into her skin and filled her neck and arms with their poison. She felt her muscles lock up and her reflexes told her to keep pushing, to break free of this trap. But she knew that any movement, even speaking, would be excruciating and futile.</p>
<p>Fajro spoke to her calmly, "I didn't want to resort to this, but you've disrespected me and everyone in this room. Your misguided tongue must be kept silent."</p>
<p>She stared at him intently, trying to forget the pain across her chest, the sting upon her throat. <em>He needs me,</em> she thought. <em>Bringing me here. Speaking to Liffa. There's a purpose to all this.</em></p>
<p>He turned toward everyone in the room as they sat looking to him and Melna. "We are about to make history as the first people to make contact with life outside of our own planet. You all play a vital role to the survival of our species. In our mission, a mistake will cost you your own life, your families lives. Everyone you know will cease to exist."</p>
<p>He held a moment of dramatic silence</p>
<p>"For Ara!" he growled.</p>
<p>And the room bellowed in unison, "For Ara!"</p>
<p>He gestured with his hand in a twirling motion and they all returned to their bulbs and paper.</p>
<p>"Operator, public," he ordered.</p>
<p>Thi flipped a switch and the room filled with static and the sound of my breath in the capsule. Fajro lifted the microphone to his mouth again and glanced back at Melna to ensure she saw that he was in control.</p>
<p>"Liffa, you're about to pass to the other side of the obscura. Describe to us what you see."</p>
<p>"Y-Yes sir," I said. "I've been watching the obscura closely now. It… looks a bunch of circles. They're all growing outward from their centers."</p>
<p>"And how large are these circles?"</p>
<p>"No larger than a train car. But there are so many. More than I can see. More than I can count."</p>
<p>"Can you see the beings?," he asked pointedly.</p>
<p>"I… don't know."</p>
<p>"You have to give us more than that."</p>
<p>"I can't see very far," I told the truth. "My vision… It's blurry."</p>
<p>He was doubtful, but continued.</p>
<p>"Just tell me what you can see then."</p>
<p>"I'm just a few thousand paces out now; velocity relative to the obscura is low… I think I can see some detail in the shapes."</p>
<p>"What do you see?" He spurted with an eager breath.</p>
<p>"These circles, they have barely any thickness at all."</p>
<p>"There must be something building them."</p>
<p>"They appear to be… unraveling. Like some sort of fabric."</p>
<p>Every eye in the room looked up at once, silently processing what such a thing could mean. For themselves, for their families. They were all convinced that this enemy lived like them, thought like them: hostile and intelligent, surviving within the confines of whatever planet where they came from. But no one knew what to make of this.</p>
<p>"Liffa, have you tried the signal?"</p>
<p>"I tried it a bit further out. Let me try again."</p>
<p>Fajro took his finger off of the microphone lever and yelled across the room, "Kavva, how close is Liffa to the obscura?"</p>
<p>"About 800 paces, sir," he yelle in response.</p>
<p>He paused a moment then with a hurried voice he said, "Liffa, is it done? What do you see?"</p>
<p>"The fabric… has torn. Right where I'm headed."</p>
<p>"Torn?"</p>
<p>"I can see Ara now. Oh it's so bright! And the shapes, they don't end… they're -o…"</p>
<p>"Liffa? Liffa, are you there?"</p>
<p>The line went turbulent with static and shreds of Liffas voice.</p>
<p>Melna wanted to cry out hae name, to embrace hae and tell hae it was okay; that thi didn't have to face the end alone. But the stinging pain around her neck took her words, like Ramne had taken her agency.</p>
<p>Fajro switched off the microphone and signalled the operator to switch off the speaker. The room was dead with every eye glued on their dear leader, looking for answers that were not there. He put down the listeners and paused for a moment. Then he walked over to Melna and carefully removed the razor vine from her neck. She breathed deeply for a moment, catching the depth from all her shallow breaths.</p>
<p>"I was prepared to offer you a deal, Melna. The chance to join me in welcoming our hero back home from a glorious victory against the obscura. But this… can never leave this room. Please understand."</p>
<p>She caught his meaning immediately, and in a moment she knew what to say.</p>
<p>"How long do you think it will be before your cover is blown?"</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?" He barked at her.</p>
<p>"You think people will believe that Heiko was destroyed by a paper lantern in the sky? That you came to our rescue just in time? You're not the only ones with eyes on Ara or ears to the air. The truth doesn't need to leave this room for it to see the light of day."</p>
<p>He chuckled menacingly, "You're more clever than you look. Perhaps you're right. The observer you sent to Holrag was quite astute; a man like him could arrive at the truth on his own. But what good is that truth in the hands of a nobody?"</p>
<p>"You underestimate the power of our principles, Holragi."</p>
<p>He eyed her up and down, measuring the weight of her wager.</p>
<p>"You have a deal in mind," he asked coyly, "let's hear it."</p>
<p>"An address. To my people."</p>
<p>"How stupid do you think I am?"</p>
<p>"Deeply – if you thought that Heiko would run to you with open arms."</p>
<p>"The threat of imminent death will be all the motivation they need."</p>
<p>"We are a fiercely loyal people; a slaver could ever take that from us. You wish to extract labor from us, then you need someone to ease the transition. You need me."</p>
<p>"Your people hate you."</p>
<p>"They hate you even more."</p>
<p>He paused, turning the deal over in his head, and pacing away and back toward Melna.</p>
<p>"Unification. You may doubt me when I say this, but that's all I ever wanted when I joined the senate, and I was willing to wage a war to do it. But the senate didn't like it when I told them that. They convince people to stay in line, to stay comfortable, to stay feeble. They convince every nation to act in the service of peace. But peace is a veil, Melna. It keeps us from our true potential as a species. Peace is what put us in this situation - cowering in the dark, out of options. War is where heroes are made. Where civilization itself is tested."</p>
<p>"War is where civilization goes to die. Innumerable lives are lost, families are shattered, the principles that keep our society safe from itself are forgotten. The senate maintains peace because the alternative is senseless death."</p>
<p>"Look around you. We are standing here at the gates of the enemy, debating amongst each other while they siphon off every resource we have. Talk is dead. We need the collective force of all of Palinan to work together if we are to survive."</p>
<p>"With you at the helm?"</p>
<p>"Well, frankly," he stopped and lifted his arms as if holding up the universe as evidence. "Yes."</p>
<p>The pale white light illuminated the creases of his face as he took one last look at her. She met his gaze, wondering how it all came to this.</p>
<p>"Shall we?" he asked.</p></div>

<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter22">Chapter 22</h2>
<p><em>Plink… Plink.</em></p>
<p>A steady drip of water counted time on Melna's forehead during the short ride to Heiko in a small submersible. Her mind wandered to the people she'd stumbled upon in her path, all the secrets she'd been told and technology she'd gained, and that mysterious maman who couldn't die. Jumping off of Shinna's boat, swimming in a cold that most Throngia would perish in. She wondered if the ocean fables were true, that in drowning your spirit is infused with the ocean. She imagined the maman swimming through the tallest waves, sweeping fishers and kelpers off their feet when they aren't paying attention. They would know hae well when thi came around. They would fear hae as thi spoke.</p>
<p>Perhaps thi was there with her, in the drops of ocean from the broken door of that small submersible. Or perhaps thi survived, hiding in the space between Heiko and Rudjan; a whole life waiting for hae in the last remnants of the light.</p>
<p>"When we land, we head straight to the conduit," said Fajro, repeating himself. "I'll speak first."</p>
<p>"You're nervous," she observed.</p>
<p>"Don't get cheeky," he said without looking at her.</p>
<p>She paused to look at him closer, peered into the deep fissures and splotches of his face, the marks of a man who had worked hard for the privilege of working harder. And she saw something else.</p>
<p>"When did the paosin stop working."</p>
<p>He immediately shot her a scowl and said, "You'll learn to keep your mouth shut, woman."</p>
<p>"An ex-fidelant using illegal narcotics. Now that's quite the scandal."</p>
<p>"I know my limits. And that's far better than I can say for Heikoi. One giant Paosin den, the lot of you."</p>
<p>"We take care of every one instead of letting them spend the rest of their lives in a haze."</p>
<p>"And how does pandering to the socially inept help anyone?"</p>
<p>She knew the conversation was a dead end, so she held her tongue.</p>
<p>"Those who cannot control their own minds deserve to perish by them," he said as he kept his gaze fixed upon the small window at the front of the craft, where he sat.</p>
<p>"A society that refuses to help its members in need deserves to perish along with them."</p>
<p>"The wicked belong to the soil. The worms would make better use of their bodies."</p>
<p>The hull of their vehicle scraped against the sand as it came to a stop. The crashing of waves and a murmur of the Heikoan accent told her that they'd arrived near the city.</p>
<p>The pilot rose from hae chair and stood in front of Melna, turning a knob to open the leaky door above her. She thanked hae as thi turned back to hae seat, and thi gave a nervous glance of acknowledgement.</p>
<p>"After me," Fajro told her, waving his hand as he stood up and moved just below the opened hatch. A rope with a loop was lowered into the vessel and he placed his good foot into it, using the loop as a sort of stirrup. A soldier pushed Melna toward the hole to get ready for the next rope. She felt an intense wave of anxiety when she thought of showing up with such news and under such circumstances.</p>
<p>She held tightly to the rope and emerged on the top of a metal vessel, just a step from a small pier in the harbor where hundreds of Heikoi ships lay sleeping at their docks. But all along the sand, nearly sixty other ships like theirs had landed on the shore and emptied their Holragi occupants onto the beach; all of them armed with guns and dressed in thick armor made from the feathers of the zaikara bird. The night air was still with the aroma of anomin smoke, telling of the lights she'd seen from afar.</p>
<p>Above her, already on the pier, Fajro had a smile on his face as he watched his soldiers storming the city.</p>
<p>"You've certainly brought some friends with you," she said to him soberly, unbothered by seeing her home overrun.</p>
<p>"Just cooperate," he said, "and no one will come to harm. This partnership will be the first of many–"</p>
<p>"This is an invasion, not a partnership."</p>
<p>"Well now," he said, turning his head toward the city. "I suppose that's up to you."</p>
<p>He held out his hand, pointing toward the road that led to the station square, signalling for Melna to walk in front of him.</p>
<p>"What better place than the place of your oath-taking. They will be reminded of your authority."</p>
<p>"A fidelant holds duty above authority. They will be looking to me for answers."</p>
<p>"So let them be reminded of your importance while they do."</p>
<p>"žah-Fajro, you should like to remember that the Heikoi do not measure the value of a life. I am no more important than the farmer selling hae harvest nor the doctor minding his patients."</p>
<p>He tossed up his hands and said, "Fine. Where is good for you then?"</p>
<p>She smiled as if conjuring some plan in her head. "Here. Where the ocean weathers the sand. I'll speak upon the pier there." She pointed toward a wide, wooden deck that towered over the water below. A broad sloped clearing of stone was set into the sand where several piers adjoined the land, with room for thousands in a crowd.</p>
<p>Fajro gestured to two soldiers and they ran toward the station square.</p>
<p>"But the order remains," he commanded, "I speak first."</p>
<p>"Yes. Of course," she said.</p>
<p>"Remember your place in all this, Melna. The wrong words could cost you everything."</p>
<p>"And the same goes for you," she responded with a tone of confidence. Without looking, she knew that a scowl rested upon his face. She wondered if he knew.</p>
<p>The sand on the beach had always been kind to tread upon but now it filled her feet with the sort of cold that travels along the empty spaces in bones and freezes in the joints. As they approached the larger pier, disparate groups of throngia and saffa began to gather. She watched with anger as the soldiers corralled them with loud orders and cracks in the air. Many were in the first stages of malnourishment, with their eyes sunken and their limbs trembling in the cold.</p>
<p>When the Heikoi saw her, they were aghast at seeing their fidelant dressed in robes amongst hostile company. Some of them stared at her with hostile eyes, not seeing anything that would calm their concerns. Still others held their arms out and cried for her, still holding on to the hope that Melna could help them. Her own face flushed with small droplets from the pores in her hydroderm, but she quickly stopped herself; they needed to see her strength to know their own.</p>
<p>From the crowd she spotted Jathi and Thimlu who put their hands on their chests in solidarity with her. She wanted so badly to run to them, to hold their hands in communion and tell them everything she'd learned. But a nod would have to do, she thought. A nod would be enough.</p>
<p>Upon the first few staves of the pier, a small group of soldiers had gathered around a table to set up some strange electrical equipment that had wires running to their small submersible back on the beach. Through the crowd, the soldiers were handing out small devices that resembled listeners.</p>
<p>"The whole world will want to hear what we have to say," said Fajro.</p>
<p>Melna's stare was focused on her people. From her satchel, she produced the wooden listener that Fanla had dropped for her at the gates of Rudjan, and surreptitiously placed it on the ear furthest from Fajro. There was a pattern in the static that she hadn't heard before.</p>
<p>A soldier came up to Fajro and said, "Sir, we are ready for the broadcast."</p>
<p>"Yes," he said, adjusting his coat impatiently. "Yes, let's begin."</p>
<p>He moved to a position in front of the table, with the people of Heiko before him and took a microphone from a table near the equipment. He waited with a patronizing smile as all of the crowd anxiously put the listeners to their ears for the first time. At the back of the crowd, Melna spotted a familiar face meandering through the people to get closer to Melna. She thought she was seeing things, but once she had come close enough, Pomri's smile became unmistakeable. A wide, broken smile beamed across Melna's face for the first time in what felt like an eternity. Without taking her eyes off of Melna, Pomri settled into a pocket of the crowd near the front.</p>
<p>"Good evening. I am Fajro um Holrag. Former fidelant for Holrag and primary benefactor of the Holragi Spacerail. I stand before the people of Heiko today, with your dearest fidelant Melna, to bring great news to both our peoples. We are also broadcasting this over the air to every conduit in the twelve provinces. This announcement will truly be a pivotal moment in the history of our world."</p>
<p>He smiled at the crowd, expecting the sounds of awe and wonder, but there was only one emotion on their minds at that moment: worry. Melna could still hear the pattern in the static of her listener, but Fajro's voice was absent. <em>Curious</em>.</p>
<p>"On behalf of my colleague Melna, I would like to announce that Holrag has uncovered the secrets of the obscura, and we are now planning countermeasures to fight off our mutual enemy."</p>
<p>Some in the crowd grew excited at this news, but most remained skeptical, waiting for Melna to comment before judging its trustworthiness.</p>
<p>"As you know, this enemy is like nothing we've ever seen before. And to fight it requires us to cooperate in radical ways; to pool our resources into a project larger than anything our planet has ever seen. Now, Holrag and Heiko have had our differences, but we knew that we had to work through them, that there was no time to quarrel over details. In a bold act of unity, Melna has pledged the services of Heiko to the Holrag, forging a strong alliance to help us all accomplish this herculean effort in time."</p>
<p>He waited for some sort of excited sound, but the crowd remained silent, trying to fully understand what he was telling them.</p>
<p>"Together, we will build a fortress in the sand: a shelter for all the world's inhabitants where we can wait comfortably until the obscura subsides. There is no greater cause than the survival of our species, and I am immensely proud of all of Heiko for answering the call. I'd now like to invite Melna who will speak about this historic alliance."</p>
<p>He passed the microphone listener to Melna who manufactured the best smile of acceptance she could muster. He walked behind her, standing very close in case she tried anything again. To his right was the operator who he'd berated for acting slowly. He whispered to hae, "Be ready to cut on my signal."</p>
<p>Melna rose the microphone to her mouth and looked at her people. <em>This will be my last address</em>, she thought. <em>Best not to hesitate</em>.</p>
<p>She began.</p>
<p>"Friends. Heikoi. Pangum of Palinan."</p>
<p>Pomri suddenly stood up and permeated the crowd, slowly weaving in and out of people and whispering something to them. On the listener, the pattern in the static was louder, but she paid no mind to it.</p>
<p>"There's something I've always admired about our spirit," she began. "We don't give up in the face of adversity. We commune with each other to accomplish a greater good. And most importantly, we sacrifice everything to do what is right. For years, we throngia fought each other for land on this precious ring of life. But at some point we realized we would all be much better off if we shared it with each other, and through diplomacy we achieved lasting peace in the senate. This new enemy believes themselves superior to us. We cannot reason with them, for they refuse to communicate. We cannot trade because they would rather destroy everything that we have. Survival will require change. To abandon our old lives and embrace the new, however strange and painful it may be. But whatever comes, we will not back down, no matter the circumstances. We will survive this together."</p>
<p>Some in the crowd cheered, and Fajro went to pull the listener away, but Melna stepped away from him, toward the crowd as if to join them. By now, the beating hum in her listener was much louder and clearer, and she could almost make out the sound of a woman's voice calling amongst splashes of water. "Steady! Hold formation!". She spoke with fire and conviction, and filled Melna's heart. Melna caught sight of Fanla, her eyes flowing, a torrent of unspoken words. And suddenly, she understood what she had to say.</p>
<p>"Behind you is Ara. It has long been a symbol of life and vitality, but now it is dying and there is little we can do to stop it."</p>
<p>Fajro called loudly behind her, "Melna, there is no time for this," But she persisted. This was her moment.</p>
<p>"As you look to me for guidance, I want you to stand tall and look further, for I will no longer be with you. Before you, I stand on a pier that harbors ships into the cold, dark sea of Ulu. It has always been a dangerous and unknown place, but I need you to trust me when I tell you that the future of Heiko is waiting for you behind this fog."</p>
<p>"Cut it!" Fajro yelled to the operator, but thi was caught as if in a trance. Fajro reached for her, but she dodged him and lifted the dagger from her robes all in one swift movement. His momentum sent him to the ground and a dozen soldiers ran to his aid, but they were all too late. Melna lifted Fajro by his coat and held him against her with the dagger at his neck.</p>
<p>"Run! Run! Run!" Melna yelled into the listener as she slowly backed away down the pier with Fajro in her arms. As if on cue, the crowd immediately ran to the beach, fighting and pushing any soldiers that were in the way. A few Heikoi guards were busy holding off the soldiers behind them while Pomri kept the soldiers closest to Melna busy. The sound of guns and clanging upset the air as Heikoi and Holragi fell, spilling their blood and water across the stone.</p>
<p>From the sea, thunderous horns filled the air as an armada of glowing blue lights appeared from the mist of the night: paddlers cutting through the water as if it were air. They poured themselves onto the beach, tossing metal balls into the submersibles that exploded on impact and helping people onto their canoes. A handful of Holragi soldiers rushed to the remaining submersibles, escaping under the water where they couldn't be seen.</p>
<p>"You've doomed us all," Fajro spoke roughly as she pulled him down the pier. "We could have had something great."</p>
<p>"There is nothing greater than being free," she said.</p>
<p>She could feel the burn on her hydroderm opening up, and all of the blood that had gathered there began to seeping. She winced with each step backward, trying to focus on getting Fajro to the edge of the pier. In the distance, Pomri was being pushed back toward the others, and a pair of soldiers had turned their focus back on Melna.</p>
<p>"The ones who come after will do what we couldn't. They will learn to temper their differences. They will be better than we could be."</p>
<p>"There will be no after," said Fajro. "You know just as well that the obscura is immovable… impenetrable. Death is all that awaits us."</p>
<p>"If death is to come for us all, then let us show our courage, and not our cowardice. Let us stare into heaven and dive into the sea. Until we know that death is all there is."</p>
<p>He smirked, "You sound just like Liffa," he said. "Believing in the cause. Becoming a hero. The truth is, it didn't matter what thi saw up there. The rail was always a weapon, and Heiko its testing ground. The obscura was a convenient excuse to that end. I only wish it had been a little smaller.</p>
<p>"You have forsaken your confidence, and sullied the name of the Fidelity. Your secrets end here."</p>
<p>With a sudden jab of his elbow he pushed her knife away and twisted out of her chokehold, narrowly missing the blade, and tumbled toward the edge of the pier, narrowly falling off but for a hand on the deck. Melna saw that she was vulnerable and ran after him amidst a flurry of gunfire and jumped off the pier, catching his leg on the way down to pull him off with her. The salt stung against her newly-opened burns and she screamed out in pain as they fell deeper, but still she held tightly to Fajro's leg, fighting his kicks to reach the surface. There was a sudden tightness in her side, and then a searing hot sensation and a radiating warmth in the water. She let go of him to cover the wound, but there was no time to look – she had to finish what she'd begun. She spotted Fajro surfacing above her and tugged hard on his leg, sending him under again. Her grip released and took his arm instead, holding it true and letting her other hand lay the blade to rest upon his neck. It was done.</p>
<p>The soldiers were recovering his body when she last saw his lifeless face staring back at her. In the shallows beneath the pier, not fifty paces away, she lay upon the sand, clinging to the wound in her side and looking out toward the water. The morning light had begun to form filaments between the rafters as the wind picked up and the fog dissapated. Cutting through the shallow waves were the canoes, filled to the brim with terrified Heikoi whom Pomri was amongst, she was certain. In the distance, the forward ram of Shinna's ship played with the light as it channeled the wind to dodge the movements of the Holragi behemoth.</p>
<p>She smiled.</p>
<p>Just before drifting off, she whispered a silent benediction to the people she had never met who risked their lives to save her people. All around her, she felt Kipnu's warm embrace in the waves as the last words from her mouth transpired into the wind.</p>
<p>"Lovely morning, Liffa."</p></div>

<p><em>Log 31 - 2:4:0:5</em></p>
<p>The light was everywhere.</p>
<p>It was beautiful, serene. It was warm, overwhelming, as if the whole universe were embracing her all at once. Thi was ready for the end.</p>
<p>Thi drew a breath, then turned a knob near her head and a brass tumbler near hae head began rotating from beneath a glass window. Thi flipped a switch labelled "etch" and a small needle came down onto the tumbler and began making markings.</p>
<p>"I don't know if you can hear me down there but I'm still alive."</p>
<p>"It's been two–"</p>
<p>Thi choked back a tear and listened to the stale echo of hae voice in the cabin.</p>
<p>"Two days and Four va'la… since launch."</p>
<p>"This is my first" <em>last</em> "… first log since radio silence. I passed through the obscura with only no deviation in my trajectory. It was like breaking through a delicate piece of fabric: I barely knew it was there. Some of it stuck to my craft; I can see it on the windows, but it doesn't seem to be doing any harm."</p>
<p>"Of course, you know by now, that the obscura is surrounding all of Ara like a shell. Even if we could blast away the portion nearest us, it would rotate and rebuild and we would be right back to where we were. We never stood a chance."</p>
<p>Thi adjusted haeself in the craft.</p>
<p>"When I look out the window, All I see is light. I can't look for very long. It's so bright."</p>
<p>"I had to push the walls to orient the window away from Ara. But the obscura is still… it's everywhere I can see and incredibly bright. A pale red-infrared sky below me."</p>
<p>"It's beautiful in a way… In it's own way. I never knew something so destructive could evoke such beauty. I'm not sure these things understand what beauty is. I don't imagine they care."</p>
<p>Thi paused and drew a gulp of water from the water tank. It cooled her head and throat.</p>
<p>"The obscura… I don't know of a good way to describe them other than thin rocks that seem to be assembling themselves into extremely flat and thin surfaces. I can't imagine how it might do such a thing. As to whether this is natural or not, I believe that is so far beyond our understanding that the question is meaningless. In my prior logs, I talked about communication, what I might say to these imaginary beings that we made up on the ground, how I might learn their language, form a connection. It seems so silly now, but I think there may be something. Not through sounds, or movements. But through something else. Maybe they can hear me now, speaking into the void."</p>
<p>A sigh and a sniffle rattled the air as thi wiped a tear from hae face.</p>
<p>"Whoever is listening to this… I want you to know that I'm not afraid of what comes next."</p>
<p>"My nather taught me to befriend my fear, so I know when it's betraying me. But I don't feel it now. I know that I should be afraid. It's strange that I'm not. But this place, this vast sea of light: it makes me feel at ease. I know that I will be remembered. That's all anyone can ask for when they leave."</p>
<p>A high-pitched twinkling sound entered hae sound field. The binding pendant around hae neck was floating in front of hae.</p>
<p>"We were just regular people… We got swept up in the chaos of it all. Kipnu and Melna and me. I could say that we didn't deserve to die. But doesn't everyone deserve to live? We stuck our heads where others buried theirs. I'll never know if our efforts mattered. But honestly, I don't give a damn. We tried."</p>
<p>"…Well," thi dotted the silence, but nothing else came to hae.</p>
<p>"It's getting rather hot up here. Think I'll spare you the details."</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter23">Chapter 23</h2>
<p>"So that's how it happened?"</p>
<p>"I did what I had to."</p>
<p>My nather and I sat in the darkness and the deafening snow, leaning against a Ziyu that stood watch above the reconstruction of the Great Pavilion of Ulukoma. This was the place where she last saw Kipnu; where a woman named Fanla had kept her alive.</p>
<p>"And mom?"</p>
<p>Setre sighed and looked down.</p>
<p>"You promised to save hae. Where were you?"</p>
<p>"Everything was on fire, Lin. It was–"</p>
<p>"You. Promised." I glared at her, my face much closer to hers than I remember from standing under her before Shinna.</p>
<p>She tried to put a hand on my shoulder, but I was stubborn, shrugged her hand off.</p>
<p>"Linyu, I did what I could. The fire… surprised everyone. We were already engaged by the time-"</p>
<p>"Fuck the fire," I growled and stood up. "My mother was willing to die to restore justice to Ulukoma. When we left, you promised me you would never let it come to that."</p>
<p>"Linyu," she called to me as I stormed behind the ziyu, "stop this nonsense."</p>
<p>I turned and screamed at her, "Everyone I love has died! How dare you call my feelings nonsense?"</p>
<p>She looked at me, speechless, in a sort of way she reserved for no one else. As if to remind me that she was still my nather, that a good kaln would not take her patience for granted. But we both knew the truth. She was my nather, but my mother raised me alone.</p>
<p>I raised the microphone on the ziyu and spoke.</p>
<p>"Liffa. I don't know if you can hear this. I want you to know, that you are not forgotten. I'm trying to figure out where you'll land so I can get to you. If you can hear this… please send some sort of signal."</p>
<p>The silence and static in my listener grew but my finger lingered on the speaking lever, waiting for a moment of hope. It didn't come.</p>
<p>"That's enough," Setre said. "They'll find us here if you keep that up."</p>
<p>"So let them! We can fight!" I responded. "What good is sitting?!"</p>
<p>She looked at me in a way she reserved for no one else. As if to remind me that she was still my nather, that a good kaln would not take the patience of hae nather for granted.</p>
<p>"Lin. What did your mother teach you to do with a problem?"</p>
<p>"Don't talk to me about my mother."</p>
<p>She paused and looked to the side, softened her voice. "She meant a lot to more than just you, you know."</p>
<p>Still I couldn't look her in the eye, but I felt a small pang of guilt.</p>
<p>"Solve it," I answered her.</p>
<p>"Before that."</p>
<p>"…Understand it."</p>
<p>"And how do you understand a problem you've never seen before?"</p>
<p>I caught her meaning, but late.</p>
<p>Her voice had calmed to a cajole, "By talking to the people around you. We'll never get anywhere fighting, so let's look ahead and try our best."</p>
<p>"You're just looking to shirk your responsibilities. Be honest, you didn't grieve when thi died."</p>
<p>She raised her voice again, "I can't afford to grieve!" It was broken, and it was hurt, and I regretted what I had just said.</p>
<p>With a loud thud of her spear against the ground, she lifted herself and stormed off toward the crowd, leaving me to my own thoughts. I looked out into the active crowd, mostly of Heikoi refugees. They were huddled around small fires dotting a wide stone basin where the eternal flame used to dance. A few adults were treating the wounded near a larger fire, making use of its bright light and sanitizing heat. Their spirit reminded me of Kipnu. When I woke from death that night on the beach of Ulukoma and the first thing I saw was his face and the unwavering concern for life. These were truly strangers in this place. They were displaced and came to us out of necessity. And yet the looks on their faces told me that they still felt uncomfortable around a people they were taught to distrust.</p>
<p>"Setre, we need to talk," said Pomri, approaching her. I kept my position by the tree and listened closely.</p>
<p>"Pomri," she spoke her name with a solemn pity, empathizing about Melna's loss, trying to keep her voice from breaking again. But Pomri was focused on her people.</p>
<p>"Heiko has just been wiped away. Half of our people have been captured or killed. Why are we just sitting here?", Pomri asked, incredulous, "We should go back. Look for survivors, recover what's left of our homeland."</p>
<p>She heard Pomri, and wanted to believe her, but she knew the power of the weapon that had been used on Heiko. How unlikely it would have been that anything recognizable would remain. But she couldn't say that to Pomri as much as she wanted to.</p>
<p>"No. It's too dangerous. The Holragi may have returned."</p>
<p>"Why would they do that? They've already finished with us. What could they possibly still want with Heiko now?"</p>
<p>"They will not stop. Not until everyone is under their thumb."</p>
<p>"Then let us prick the thumb," she said, "'til there is no more blood to spill."</p>
<p>Setre let out a sigh, seeing that she wouldn't be able to convince her that easily.</p>
<p>"Setre," Pomri said, "This is for closure. We need to be able to say that we did all we could in the aftermath."</p>
<p>"You already know what I'm going to say."</p>
<p>Pomri cursed the wind and turned away, looking at nothing in particular.</p>
<p>Melna tried to persuade her, "Let's give our people some rest for a time. "They've been through a lot."</p>
<p>"Do you think any of us can rest at a time like this? Every idle moment could be a life saved from the rubble–"</p>
<p>"Or a life lost chasing the dead."</p>
<p>"If even one is alive, it will have been worth it."</p>
<p>They stared at each other intensely, knowing they were not likely to reach an agreement. But Setre had authority with the shipkeepers of Ulukoma, and she would never send them on a suicide mission.</p>
<p>Setre spoke with gravity, as if to lay a blanket upon the conversation, "We're staying here."</p>
<p>Pomri leaned back without breaking eye contact and gave Setre a sardonic look.</p>
<p>"I understand," she said coldly. And without hesitation, she walked away and sat back down with a group that had kept space for her beside a fire. I jolted forward to walk with her, but my nather held me back, saying "Don't follow her, Linyu. Her judgment is clouded by anger." But I knew Pomri, had seen her act and heard her think. I knew that her judgment was not clouded, but could do nothing to change my nather's mind.</p>
<p>Setre moved to stand upon the lip of the fire basin and took a blazing branch from the largest fire. The crowd, thousands strong, spared no time in quieting down to listen to what she had to say.</p>
<p>"Alright everyone, it's time we explained to you what's happening."</p>
<p>Her voice was strong, but carried the slightest hint of quiver. Unnoticeable to the crowd, but obvious to anyone who knew her well. <em>She still doesn't see herself as a leader.</em></p>
<p>"You are currently sitting upon the grounds of the Great Pavilion of Ulukoma. You've been brought here by those who call this place home. Not as slaves, but as refugees."</p>
<p>Her eyes darted across the area in an awkward silence, trying to think of what to say.</p>
<p>"I probably don't need to tell you that everything you knew is likely gone. This was not an accident. A man named Fajro has been consolidating the world's sccientists and engineers. And this was their first move: a coordinated assault by sky and by land meant to force your people into submitting to slavery. Consider yourselves lucky to have a leader as clever and selfless as Melna."</p>
<p>My eyes found Pomri's and peered into them. The fire before her cast glintlights off the water forming on her eyes. Her expression fell into that constellation, fervid and tenacious, taking Setre's words and purifying them in the blinding rage within her.</p>
<p>"This is not the first time the engineers of Holrag have waged war in the name of ambition. Many tribes of Holrag faced the same decision many Ka'to ago. Those who resisted-"</p>
<p>Her voice broke a little but she maintained herself. I squeezed her hand a little harder and she squeezed back.</p>
<p>She cleared her throat, and spoke again. "Ulukoma is a place of rebirth, renewal. You can live out the rest of your days here, fishing, kelping, rebuilding, leaving a legacy to the survivors of the obscura. But to get to that point, we need to take things a day at a time. Right now, we need to figure out how to feed everyone and rebuild shelter from the snow."</p>
<p>She pointed to a group of Ulukomai near her, focusing on a man and a maman, both of them fit enough to carry an entire tree between them.</p>
<p>"Kinsho will lead the fishers. Senri, the kelpers. Fanla will continue with the medical team. Rev'i and the other guardians, resume your patrols. If you are a constructor, come to me."</p>
<p>Kinsho and Senri nodded together in affirmation.</p>
<p>"Okay. Let's not waste any time then. Go!"</p>
<p>"Fishers!" Kinsho called out with a booming voice, and hundreds rose to meet him.</p>
<p>"Kelpers with me! Kelpers!" called Senri with a higher pitch, but just as loud. They walked in opposite directions, drawing eager people away from their grief, their paralysis, leaving only the doctors and the infirm. Pomri and a few from her group stayed with the doctors, helping wherever she could.</p>
<p>My nather's hand led me along toward the snow-covered pillars that would soon be the entrance of the new pavilion. Only a handful of Heikoi had joined her group of Ulukomai builders. I assumed that the rest must have stayed in Heiko, protecting the city they had built. My mind wandered to Melna, seeing her and Fajro fall into the water. Of my nather keeping her ship a safe distance away while Pomri fought off solider after soldier on the shoreline, trying to get to Melna, but being pushed into the water instead.</p>
<p>"This is all we have?" she asked the group.</p>
<p>"Yes ma'am," said a maman. Thi had shell-shocked eyes and was shivering slightly in the cold. "The engineers are bound to protect the city. We are just apprentices."</p>
<p>Melna looked frustrated. <em>What a ridiculous law</em>, she thought.</p>
<p>"Very well. What do you know how to do?"</p>
<p>"We can quarter saw. Salt seal."</p>
<p>"That's it? What about Trussing? Joints? Cranes?"</p>
<p>All in the group hesitated, and Melna grew more frustrated. This was basic work in Holrag, they should know this by now.</p>
<p>"Okay. Come with me."</p>
<p>She led them for a few steps to two trusses that had been placed before they had heard news of Heiko, and I saw them off before joining the doctors around the large fire. I know my nather saw me. She always saw me.</p>
<p>Pomri was crouched over an unconscious maman laying on a makeshift bed of salted kelp and preparing to inject kanosin into hae neck near the spinal column. She was visibly hesitant but an older woman assured her that the drug would work.</p>
<p>"Kipnu taught me for only a moment, but I've had a lot of practice over the past few days."</p>
<p>The old woman's eyes looked closer at me for some sort of answer, and saw my eager face.</p>
<p>"Would you like to help?"</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>She shifted herself without standing, waving at a nervous Pomri to stop, then took my hand and held it steady against the maman's back.</p>
<p>"Hold hae body like this so I can make the injection. Steady now."</p>
<p>The needle was as thick as the wires I used for listeners, but the tip was precisely machined and oxidized a pale green. Shaki titanium. She placed it at the base of the maman's neck, angling it to inject toward hae head, and I watched as the blue liquid disappeared into the body of the maman. With a final push, her hand finished and then gently extracted the needle. Some small remnants of kanosin were pushed into hae hydroderm where they glowed and spread across it like a flow tattoo. Instinctively, I took small coal from the fire and quickly pressed it hard against the wound to stop the bleeding. Pomri stared in disbelief.</p>
<p>"You've… done this before?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," I said coldly.</p>
<p>I gently laid the maman back down and took up the syringe for rinsing and sanitation near the fire. Pomri followed me as I moved.</p>
<p>"What is this drug we're giving them?"</p>
<p>"Kanosin," I said, slowly rinsing the syringe in a basin of ocean water. I pulled the plunger out to fill it and pushed it again to empty.</p>
<p>"What? That's a drug! Why are you using it on the injured?!"</p>
<p>"Because it works."</p>
<p>She gaped, both astonished and deeply horrified. I stopped the rinsing and walked a few paces to fetch a long monobodied forcep, placing the syringe into the end and immersing it into the fire. I didn't speak. My mother had taught me to be discerning about who I told about Kanosin; only those those who would use the knowledge well and accept its truth deserved to know. Pomri would barely accept what she saw herself.</p>
<p>"Where I'm from, you would be banished for doing that."</p>
<p>"Where I'm from, A person's life is worth more than a day off from consciousness."</p>
<p>Pomri was taken aback, unsure of what to say, but still immensely curious.</p>
<p>"How does it work?" she implored.</p>
<p>"I don't know," I said. A practiced lie, but a good one.</p>
<p>I removed the syringe from the fire and looked closely at the tip. A film of char covered it, showing that it had been sanitized. I searched for the basket of syringes I had seen before and spotted it near to an old guardian of Shinna's who was tending to a famished skeleton of a throngia. But before I could move, Pomri took up my free hand and wrapped her own around it.</p>
<p>"Come to Heiko with me," she pleaded under her breath. Her eyes had a fire to them I hadn't seen before: determined and brazen.</p>
<p>I glowered at her, at the ease with which she went behind my nather's back. But she saw that I was old enough to have my own thoughts, knew that I needed closure just as much as she did: a closure that Setre could not be persuaded to allow.</p>
<p>"Mid-day's nap. Find me on the beach where we landed."</p>
<p><em>Why did I say that?!</em>, I thought. But I didn't stop myself. I wasn't bound by regret, only worry for my nather. She nodded back with that same intensity.</p>
<p>Pomri returned to the maman she was monitoring to take hae vitals and ensure thi was warm. With a quick twist, I secured a cover onto the syringe and placed it in the basket with the others, giving a nod to the old guardian. A deep sense of guilt overshadowed my thoughts and drew my eyes toward the pavilion. Impatiently, she darted here and there like a tilmarim in the dark, teaching people how to construct a truss from tarred wooden posts. For the moment I let her fire into me, felt it cleanse the guilt from my heart. Our divergence was inevitable, but I remembered that we had the same goal: to outlast the obscura.</p></div>

<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter24">Chapter 24</h2>
<p>Pomri was late, naturally, but she came prepared with a small anomin lantern in hand, and a large durable bag on her back. When she arrived, she produced a rope from the bag, tying it first around herself, then around me.</p>
<p>"In case you fall in," she said. I remembered what it felt like to drown, and wasn't keen on doing it again.</p>
<p>"Are you worried?" I asked as we pushed off.</p>
<p>"About what?"</p>
<p>"What if we find her?"</p>
<p>Pomri paused, distracted.</p>
<p>"That's what we're here for isn't it?"</p>
<p>My silence agreed.</p>
<p>There was a certain guilt I carried onto the boat. The kind of guilt that fills your belly with vines, pretangled and on fire. A guilt that made me turn around and look back to the shoreline of Ulukoma as it sank under a patchwork of ice and waves that composed the horizon. I did not long for my nather in particular. Nor for anyone back there. But the waves and the salty air made me miss that home.</p>
<p>Presently, Kipnu came to my mind, then Melna. I imagined them side by side in the water, their eyes open, unmoving. Their spirits reached out, draped in water. They played in our wake, climbed the hull, hung from our paddles. But the gaze turned something inside of me. Those vacant eyes, peering into the void from their pale faces, the water covering them just so. And at once I was among them in that viscous ether-ocean with the bubbles and froth tickling my skin, my body unmoving and my eyes locked in that same vacant stare.</p>
<p>"Oi! Kaln! You paddling or napping?" she asked me.</p>
<p>"Sorry," I said hurriedly, and snapped out of my trance.</p>
<p>Our breaths were punctuated by gentle strokes of a two-sided paddle. With each one I could feel the boat inch ahead and new air fill my lungs. I sat behind, adding my effort and trying to keep up with Pomri, but her height and strength eclipsed my own. We paddled until a sliver of the remaining light of Ara peeked through the horizon, a signal for Pomri to call for a break. I happily took my paddles into the boat and caught my breath.</p>
<p>"You ought to be stronger than me," she said to me, hardly winded, "kaln like you has unlimited energy."</p>
<p>I finished catching my breath and responded, "I'm not tall enough."</p>
<p>"Bah barely an arm between us," she balked, "You spend too much time with those wires, 's what I think"</p>
<p>I was annoyed but I didn't take it seriously. She meant well.</p>
<p>My eyes wandered off toward the horizon to our right. There were faint signs of life in the distance, the ten thousand lantern boats of Rudjan calling to the north. And to the south, a towering shadow, darker than the dusk that hung everywhere else, hanging still in the twilight above where Heiko center should be.</p>
<p>"It's so dark," I said, looking for an answer.</p>
<p>We paused to absorb the reality that came with that cloud.</p>
<p>"When I–," her voice cracked.</p>
<p>"When I heard the explosions… paddling my heart out in the thick fog… All I could think of… was Melna. Nothing else… Nothing else mattered to me in that moment."</p>
<p>My mind recalled the moment she spoke of. I knew Melna had accomplished her goal. I knew that she wouldn't have had it any other way. But I thought of no one but Laen-Laen.</p>
<p>"Love is weird like that," I said. I tried to break the dark mood, but secretly, I also felt it.</p>
<p>But she sustained it, "Love," she exhaled as if to simper, stuck in some moment from the past, "There were times… where it must have come to that."</p>
<p>I placed my hand on her back, letting her fix time for a moment of solace. I added no more pondering than deserved it.</p>
<p>"Love is why we're out here in the cold. To give closure to the ones that stayed behind. To the ones who didn't get to say goodbye."</p>
<p>"Right…" her words drifted and made room for calm, "Right."</p>
<p>She removed her canteen and handed it to me, and I took it eagerly.</p>
<p>"We've gone pretty far south," she said, "but I think this is far enough. We don't want to get caught by some Holragi troop headed for the epicenter. If we turn toward Ara here, we can find our landing somewhere north of the city."</p>
<p>Ara. I didn't give it much thought before; it was a clock, a direction, a fixture in the background. But now every one of its last rays had become precious warmth. I wondered how we would find our orientation after Ara was completely shrouded. Would the waves still swell, and the wind still gust? Maybe orientation wouldn't matter in the dark.</p>
<p>"Linyu," she tapped my shoulder to wake me from my daydream. "Shall we go?"</p>
<p>I nodded and she turned back forward to resume her posture.</p>
<p>She told me over her shoulder, "We're entering a dangerous place. There may be looters or Holragi soldiers searching for survivors. The land itself may be fragile and broken. You'll have to keep your wits about you at all times."</p>
<p>"Got it," I said. <em>I hope I do.</em></p>
<p>"We have about two va'na of paddling left. Can you make it?"</p>
<p>"I'll try."</p>
<p>"Push through if you can. The time we have to rescue people is wearing thin."</p>
<p>I nodded and my resolve was affirmed. There was no turning back.</p>
<p>A firm command from Pomri, and we took up our paddles again, resuming the slow cadence of wood against the water.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Waves," I said, "Hitting land. Over there."</p>
<p>I pointed to the right just in Pomri's view, and she paused to listen closer. <em>Resonance.</em></p>
<p>"A cove," I said, to her surprise, "We can find cover for our boat."</p>
<p>Pomri asked out loud, "How could you possibly?.."</p>
<p>But she didn't wait for me to respond, just shook her head in disbelief, and resumed her paddling.</p>
<p>The opening of the cove was wide and tall enough for a whole freighter. It opened to the ocean like the mouth of a colossus slowly swallowing us whole. It sent a shudder through me and my arms grew weak, but Pomri stilled me. "Aey-Aey," she said confidently, and my muscles responded with the last reserves of their strength. We had gone just a few tens of paces in and the water had died down, and now Pomri began to reach with her paddle to find land in any direction. I followed her lead despite my shortness, but neither of us had found anything.</p>
<p>"Oi, let's head toward the wall to the left," she said, "This place is big."</p>
<p>We turned and paddled softly, but it didn't take long for us to hit ground. The boat slid ashore onto a sand-and-pebble jetty with a loud <em>shhhh-ch</em>, and stopped abruptly. Pomri wasted no time untying the rope and hopping out.</p>
<p>"Let's go," she said, already off the boat, and I instinctively clambered to the front, trying to keep my balance. I could tell she was agitated, that she felt vulnerable in a place like this.</p>
<p>"Aye. I'm coming," I said.</p>
<p>Before I could set foot on the ground, I heard movement: footsteps on pebbles echoing from every wall. I stopped in my tracks to listen. They weren't deliberate and quick like a bandit or an assassin – more uncontrolled, and barely hanging on. Pomri was equally startled and moved closer to hold me back. With a swift gesture, she held her hand out in front of my mouth mouth, a command to stay quiet.</p>
<p>At the edge of the outside light, I saw two giant silhouettes of saffas, perched at the mouth of the cove and looking in just out of the light. But somewhere between the saffas and us, that cadence of slow footsteps rattled off the walls. If it were just a throngia, we could push the boat off and paddle away. But a saffa can swim and run much faster than we could ever hope to paddle or run.</p>
<p>Pomri began to approach, to put distance between me and the walking sound. She was deliberately slow and silent. Only taking a step with each wave that boomed into the mouth.</p>
<p>But then the footsteps stopped with a larger thud, as if the mysterious person had plopped all their body weight on the ground. <em>We are intruders here.</em></p>
<p>Once she was close enough, Pomri spoke up, "We don't mean any-," but before she could finish, the person in the dark had found Pomri and held a long wooden pole to her chest. She took a step back and tried to force the pole away, but it had disappeared into the darkness as the shadow fled back toward the saffas. I ran after, evading Pomri's hands and protests not to go. <em>This isn't an enemy, It can't be.</em></p>
<p>The stranger passed between the saffas, and out of the cove where the remaining Ara-light shone against hae back. I was aghast at hae feeble figure, hydroderm swollen with cold and sunken with hunger. But before I could reach hae, one of the saffas had turned and picked hae up, while the other stood ground guarding their getaway. Through the growling and shuffling of feet, I heard a sound I'd not expected to hear: the ringing jingles of a binding pendant as it rocked this way and that around the saffa's neck. And then I saw him – the thick fur and the big ears and the myriad different mannerisms that were unmistakable for anyone else but my best friend.</p>
<p>"Laen! You're alive!"</p>
<p>He hesitated, judging the voice against my motion, but then he sniffed a little and he at once he knew. He instantly let out a loud "Woop!" and rushed toward me with his big fuzzy face and his breath of stale fish. I hugged him warmly at his neck and he plopped an ear on my head while he coo'd his relief.</p>
<p>Behind, Pomri cried out in an exhausted voice, "Laen? Is it really you?"</p>
<p>But Pomri was not one to celebrate before it was due. She asked him, "Laen, who is that maman?", and he replied with an undulating "wOOooOOoo", a sound of sorrow, not of fear. I took a look at the pendant that was tied up in his chin fur and felt for its telltale shapes and edges. It felt familiar in my fingers, much like Kipnu's did upon my own neck.</p>
<p>"Whoever thi is," I said, "Thi knows Melna."</p>
<p>"Then I bet that other saffa is Boon," she said.</p>
<p>After a pause, she called us to action again. "Come, let's get out of this cove."</p>
<p>We followed Laen out onto beach where the light seemed brighter and bluer than before, a trick of the eyes. The smell of soot and ash hung on the air, a harbinger of the dark cloud that towered over Heiko. High above, it lofted into the coldwinds and hotwinds, spreading both toward and away from Ara in shades of gray ochre. Perhaps bits of it lifted into stellar space, reaching out for Liffa. But there we stood, at that imperceptable edge between dark and light, life and death, and we were in it.</p>
<p>"We'll lose our bearings in this dust," said Pomri, "Let's head to the road."</p>
<hr />
<p>Our feet took us to the traveling path and we soon reached the 1 lao'ka marking rock where we got our bearings. While Pomri and I looked for tracks, Laen had chosen a spot at the edge of the path, trying to find warmth in the thin light. He had begun to sneeze a bit and I looked back toward him, concerned.</p>
<p>"Cover your face," she told me, holding a shawl. I wrapped the shawl over myself and waited for her to do the same with a piece of fabric ripped from her coat. I couldn't help but look at Laen again.</p>
<p>"I don't have anything that could protect him," Pomri explained, "He'll have to stay here."</p>
<p>"I know… I just wanted to say goodbye."</p>
<p>"Make it quick. We still have quite a hike before we reach the pier."</p>
<p>I took the shawl from her hands and walked over to Laen with his ears perked up in anticipation. His gaze was trained upon me, yearning for answers that I couldn't find the words to explain.</p>
<p>From a satchel, I pulled a morsel of roasted seaweed I had brought from home and offered it to him.</p>
<p>"You hungry?"</p>
<p>He wasn't, but he took it gently out of respect and placed it on his left paw for later.</p>
<p>"WoOoo," he said in a grateful tone.</p>
<p>I found the spot on his back where he loved to be scratched and ran my fingers through his fur. His reflexes shook him with satisfaction. Then I stopped and laid my head and hands against him and he rested his head on the ground and tilted it to the side to better hear me.</p>
<p>"I'm so glad we found you, Laen."</p>
<p>He didn't respond, just took in the moment.</p>
<p>"Now… we have to go on, and it's too dangerous for you to come with us."</p>
<p>I spoke with a heavy heart, but Laen seemed to already know. He held his eyes open just enough to see me and closed enough to enjoy our time together peacefully.</p>
<p>"You have to take care of yourself now, okay? Your home is…"</p>
<p>I paused to stop my words and Laen made a long sigh, feeling the weight of them anyway.</p>
<p>"Maybe you'll find Boon and that maman again. Or maybe we'll be back soon and then you can stay with us. In Ulukoma."</p>
<p>His ears perked up a little bit more, in calm excitement at the thought of a new home.</p>
<p>"You'll have lots of fish. And that pohua stuff that grows in the dark. I know you like that."</p>
<p>"oomm," he said with his mouth closed.</p>
<p><em>What will you do now?</em>, I wondered. <em>What will I do?</em></p>
<p>My face flushed in sadness and I laid back against him, putting the future out of my mind. I took one look at Melna's pendant, still twisted and tangled in his fur. I put Kipnu's up to it as well, listening to them jingle together. And then a thought came over me, and I pulled a listener from my satchel. With a careful braiding of metal wire and tufts of fur, I braided it in just below his ear, making sure it wasn't so close as to damage his hearing.</p>
<p>"The wind speaks," I whispered to him.</p>
<p>"Ooo-Ooo," he responded. He didn't know the words, but that was okay.</p>
<p>"Oi, kaln," Pomri called, "It's safe for us to head in now. Let's go!"</p>
<p>"Coming!"</p>
<p>"I love you Laen," I said solemnly to him before I left.</p>
<p>He replied with a proper lick.</p></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter25">Chapter 25</h2>
<p>The rubble was everywhere. I would never have believed that something so simple could haunt me as much as that path toward Ara. Everywhere we walked, our journey was punctuated with sharp edges and unstable footing. We could barely see our feet but for the faintly ambient glow of Ara bouncing through the neverending cloud of dust, and the small lantern that Pomri had to continuously wipe clean. I was glad of her foresight.</p>
<p>"These tracks are headed toward Rudjan," she said, observing carefully. "The children who couldn't swim that distance. They would have been captured by the blockade – never had a chance."</p>
<p>I imagined myself part of that swarm of children, running for our lives as rocks and ash came tumbling down from the sky and the ground, and then a regiment of Rudjani soldiers comes to scoop us up. Would we be sold into slavery to work in the desert?</p>
<p>"Bavle said you were a traitor," I began. "Why did you choose to fight for Heiko?"</p>
<p>An anxious pause suspended her mind.</p>
<p>"They turned their backs on me. So I did the same."</p>
<p>"What did you do?"</p>
<p>Another pause held her.</p>
<p>"I killed a maman."</p>
<p>Suddenly I saw Pomri in the light of danger. I tried to imagine her killing someone and failed. But somehow the way she said it was believable. In a subtle way, too subtle for me to be aware, my muscles began to tense.</p>
<p>Pomri explained, "A merchant. Thi wasn't a criminal by the word of the law, but thi knew how to use peoples' consciousness against each other. Thi sowed seeds of hatred amongst the merchant guild to harvest them for her own personal gain, and quickly became the most wealthy trader in Rudjan by far. The government recognized what was happening, but refused to do anything about it. They were probably getting a cut too, petty cowards."</p>
<p>She paused to lift her mask and take a drink.</p>
<p>"At the time I was one of five commanders of the army, the only one to openly speak out against hae. I decided to take things into my own hands. In the dark of the night, I pretended to do a customs check of hae ship. I planted paosin below deck and arrested hae under suspicion of smugglng."</p>
<p>"But that's unlawful," I objected.</p>
<p>"Sometimes the law isn't enough to protect us. Anyway, the magistrate investigating hae shipment ledger found no evidence of smuggling and decided to exile us both. I knew the only justice that would come for hae was my own, so I triple-dosed hae with paosin patches while thi was shackled on the ship to Ulukoma. I went to Heiko and never looked back."</p>
<p>"How do you know thi's dead?"</p>
<p>"I guess I don't."</p>
<p>"Do you regret it?"</p>
<p>"No. Thi was a menace to Rudjan. Our city would be reduced to a corporate puppet if we let hae continue."</p>
<p>Her story didn't sit well with me, but perhaps I knew inside that something of the sort was in her past. I wondered if Melna knew this story. Perhaps Pomri was comfortable telling it now that the law had become meaningless.</p>
<p>She quickly changed the subject.</p>
<p>"When the road ends, we turn and continue toward Ulu."</p>
<p>"End? Wouldn't the road end in…"</p>
<p>But the obvious answer came to me. I had imagined it as an explosion, a big fireball followed by a massive plume of smoke. But this was a giant chunk of metal, a spear the size of a ship, and it was falling – straight down, from far above the sky. I imagined its speed: faster than a train or a saffa, faster than I've ever seen anything move. I imagined it boring through the center of Palinan and coming out the other side. <em>It couldn't do that… right?</em></p>
<p>"Pomri..?"</p>
<p>She glanced at me, hearing my curiosity.</p>
<p>"What exactly happened to Heiko?" I asked, anxiously.</p>
<p>She looked at me again, this time she held her stare.</p>
<p>"A damn metal ball hit it. Why do you ask such questions?"</p>
<p>"I meant… after…"</p>
<p>"You'll find out soon enough. Best not to dwell on thoughts like that."</p>
<p>"Maybe we can find survivors quicker if we can figure out what areas were hit the hardest."</p>
<p>She turned to stop me with a palm on my arm, clearly agitated, not annoyed.</p>
<p>"Look around, Linyu. You think someone could survive this chaotic mess?"</p>
<p>She lifted her hands and turned back toward the darkness.</p>
<p>"We're here for confirmation. To pay our respects and provide closure for the people who left loved ones behind. Nothing more."</p>
<p>I wanted to cry, but I had come to despise the wastefulness of tears.</p>
<p>We followed the crater edge toward the harbor, making a note of its size by tracking our paces from the long road to the Ulu road. The immensity of the crater was unsettling. If not for the dust, an absence the size of a city may have paralyzed me. But Pomri kept me going. And I wondered what kept her.</p>
<p>This place seemed so alien to me, even though I had been there just a day before. I struggled to understand even the minute parts of it: why were the rocks so jagged and the dust so incessant? were there others like Jathi, living only to die slowly? But I knew that if I asked she would say <em>"Oi, kaln. Now is not the time."</em>. So I did what my mother taught me to do once. I closed my eyes and saw myself through the dust from above, weaving perception together with inference to hold all of Heiko in my awareness. I saw it as I understood it – in the absence of sight, I could paint the image of my world on my mind. I saw a deep hole; as deep as the tallest tree is tall. A sword falling from the sky, turning the earth into dust, pushing it out in every direction. It was the concrete of their homes, the boulders upon which they built, cracked and heated and pulverized into trillions of rocks and pebbles and specks of dust. We were but a ship of the living making our way across an ocean of the dead.</p>
<p>"She's in there somewhere. I have to find her."</p>
<p>I snapped my eyes up and saw Pomri's lantern-lit eyes. The sound of waves and an odd rushing of water filled the air behind her, and I saw the crater bowing its proud lip into the ocean, having erased any memory of the harbor that came before it. save for a few jagged, broken posts. The dust was thinner here, as I assumed that the ocean was acting as a sponge, but a giant cloud of smoke stood directly between us and Ara, shortening our visibility to less than a Lao'ta.</p>
<p>She had stopped halfway through a stride, holding her lantern up to see.</p>
<p>"Ay. Damn this thing." The flame began to flicker and fade. "Never enough fuel."</p>
<p>I moved closer to her, suddenly aware of my dependence on her light. She glanced back at me as if she was surprised, expressionless, before the lantern fizzled out and we were stuck in the muddy twilight, unable to see where the path ended and where it began.</p>
<p>"I am not wasting my life because of a damn lantern," she said, setting it down harshly. I could tell she wanted to toss it into the crater, but she settled for staring at it in angry deliberation. My own deliberations were fixated on a few glass ampules and a syringe in a small writers bag in my satchel. I wasn't sure if this was the best use for them or what Pomri would think, but somehow I found the bag in my hands anyway holding them out for Pomri to feel for.</p>
<p>"What is this?"</p>
<p>"Kanosin."</p>
<p>"Oi put that away! What would you bring something like that out here for?"</p>
<p>"It can light the way."</p>
<p>"What are you on about now?"</p>
<p>She watched patiently as I pulled the ampules out and neatly injected one into the hydroderm on my left shin. From the point of the syringe the kanosin glowed and permeated the vasculature, filling every water capillary in my entire lower leg with a bright flow tattoo. I did the same to my other leg. By the time I finished the entire ground around us was pale blue and I could see Pomri's eyes in the illumination, wide-eyed and unbelieving.</p>
<p>"W… What is this?"</p>
<p>"My people live in darkness. We had to find some way to see light."</p>
<p>"So you used Kanosin?"</p>
<p>"It has many uses."</p>
<p>"And Fajro used it to enslave the tribes of Holrag."</p>
<p>"But, Fajro has never been to Ulukoma."</p>
<p>"He didn't need to."</p>
<p>She eyed one of the ampules in my hand. I held it in my hand with much deliberation, gesturing for her to take it – an offer to which she obliged, holding it up to her eye to look at closer. Her nose was widened through the liquid, and I laughed to myself.</p>
<p>"What is Kanosin?" she asked me.</p>
<p>I hesitated, remembering my mother's strict instruction not to tell anyone the truth about Kanosin. But I felt that I could trust Pomri.</p>
<p>"It's a compound. From kelp."</p>
<p>"Yes but… what does it actually do?"</p>
<p>"It…"</p>
<p>"Go on."</p>
<p>"It reverses death."</p>
<p>Pomri paused, doubtful. "Kanosin… makes you immortal?"</p>
<p>"Not exactly."</p>
<p>"And you use it as a flow tattoo?"</p>
<p>"We had no other light. How else would we continue?"</p>
<p>She held her head in disbelief. "You could save countless lives with this. Why aren't you sharing it with the world?"</p>
<p>"This world can't be saved. The obscura was a convenient distraction for Holrag. Now they control everything."</p>
<p>She grasped my arm, trying eagerly to be convincing, "Who are you to judge the future of the world? There are people in Rudjan who despise the Holragi. People that could be saved from the obscura."</p>
<p>"They can't! They can't be saved!" I plead.</p>
<p>"Why not?!"</p>
<p>My face flushed with frustration. I had learned of the dark side of this world from my parents and all the stories told by the forgotten people of Ulukoma.</p>
<p>I said, desparately, "The old tribes of Ulukoma discussed this long ago and we reached a conclusion. My mother's research on Kanosin is far too dangerous to spread beyond Ulukoma."</p>
<p>"Your tribes cannot be the gatekeeper of life and death."</p>
<p>"We must," I said. "If more people discover what we know, the Holragi will get wind of it and invade. They will take everything we have including the land we live on. Then they will be the gatekeepers."</p>
<p>With great anxiety I stood up, sinching my satchel closed while Pomri sat stewing in rage. I didn't have the strength to look in her eye. Instead, a strong urge to get away from Pomri was growing, deep within a pool of guilt. And so I left the vials, the syringe, and began to walk.</p>
<p>"Where are you going Linyu?"</p>
<p>"Back to Laen-Laen"</p>
<p>"We aren't done here."</p>
<p>I didn't respond.</p>
<p>"Just like that? You're going to walk away like you never knew me?"</p>
<p>Her voice started to break.</p>
<p>"You could have saved Kipnu! You could have saved Melna!"</p>
<p>"You're no better than the Holragi!"</p>
<p>A boulder appeared a few paces ahead, big enough to sit and hide behind, and I nearly ran to it in panic. Such words could be taken easily from a stranger, but not from a friend. I opened my hands and looked at the empty ampules. I had found them so often as toddler in Rudjan. My mother was too absent for even her best intentions to manifest. Kanosin had become an enemy. But when I met my nather, I was in awe at the brightly colored flow tattoos on her chest. She told me stories of fetching drowned fishers from the darkest waters, lit only by the light from her skin. She brought their bodies to my mother who cleared the water from their airways and recalled them back to life with kanosin. Eventually, I would have dismissed the stories as hyperbolic, but experience has only reinforced them for me. <em>Kanosin is a beast, not a demon,</em> I recalled one of my mother's sayings. <em>We must tame it, not destroy it.</em> I looked down at the bright streaks of kanosin on my legs, so alike to the patterns of my nather's skin, and I felt no shame.</p>
<p>Curiosity turned my eyes backward, where I saw her stumbling in the dark down the crater toward the last remnants of the harbor. Very faintly, I saw a blue light radiating from her left foot and left arm.</p>
<p>"There's nothing left," I said to myself. But I had to follow her to make sure she was safe.</p>
<p>She made a turn toward the water, bounding down the outside of the crater as if to notice something specific. Her steps were deliberate and painfully blind. But with great patience, she navigated through the rubble of steel and rock and made it to the waterline.</p>
<p>Into the frigid water she stepped and waded out until it covered her legs and wetted her waist. Ahead of her, the stub of a wooden column pointed toward the sky where the pier used to be, its proud top severed and washed away. Alone it stood as the last of its kind. She let her hands and head rest softly against its side, and spoke to an old friend she'd lost too soon.</p></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter26">Chapter 26</h2>
<p>In the distance, the somber cries of a man resounded from the crater, interspersed with fits of coughing. I stopped in my tracks and looked to Pomri who was close behind. She hadn't heard a thing. At first I thought my ears betrayed me, but as we kept walking, the sound grew in volume and I was compelled by instinct to run toward the cry and help. Pomri was behind me screaming "Wait!" but I did not stop. It was merely a lao'ta before I saw him through the dust, knealing with his hands behind his head and nodding his torso back and forth. I came upon him, yelling, "Aey. you alright?" but there was no answer. It was no longer clear if he was laughing or crying.</p>
<p>I illuminated his figure with the light of my legs. Deep scrapes and cuts marred his clothes and skin. Some were superficial, but most showed signs of blood loss. His eyes were bloodshot, and his face caked with black ash. It took him a moment to stop his nodding and realize my presence.</p>
<p>Through trembling lips, he stammered, "W…Who..?" but his eyes only fixated on the light. Suddenly, his hands lurched forward and grasped my ankles tightly. A reflex jolted me backward, falling to the ground, with half of my body hanging over the crater edge, my hands scraping and clambering for a solid bit of land. I looked below me into a black void, its depth was unknowable, but I knew I would certainly die if he let go.</p>
<p>"YOU DID THIS!" He roared at me as he pushed me away.</p>
<p>For a single point in time, I hung in the air, the assurance of death pulling me down to its bosom. I knew this feeling when my legs went numb in the waters of Ulukoma. When I first experienced Kanosin as a curious child in my mother's bedroom. It was familiar, neither friend nor enemy. An apparition that revealed itself on occasion. But each time a hand would reach out, pulling me from the figment of death. Setre, Kipnu.</p>
<p>This time it was Pomri, grasping my wrist just in time. She barely exerted herself pulling me up with one arm, and quickly pivoting to restrain the mysterious man. She grappled him by his arm and he panicked, stumbling on himself and wheezing heavily as he tried to get away.</p>
<p>"Speak!" she demanded, but still he didn't respond.</p>
<p>"I have nothing to give you, Holragi scum," he said staring at her feet. "Take my life or leave me to my suffering," he said.</p>
<p>"Jathi?" she asked, bewildered at seeing his face again, "Is that you?"</p>
<p>He remained there, motionless, fighting back a cough and holding his right hand to the back of his head.</p>
<p>"How did you survive?"</p>
<p>But still he did not move.</p>
<p>"He can't hear you," I chimed.</p>
<p>Pomri glanced back at me, apprehensive. Instead of fighting with her, I approached him slowly and held out my hand, to which he responded with his own. Upon his palm, I placed a finger and drew the words I wanted to say. <em>L-I-N-Y-U</em>, first, and then pointed to myself. Then <em>P-O-M-R-I</em>. His eyes lit up ever so slightly as if he knew that name, but he didn't look in her direction, only at me.</p>
<p>"I know Pomri. She warned us early. Got most of us out."</p>
<p>"Jathi… how did?" Pomri said. She was moved to tears.</p>
<p>It occured to me that he may not yet have realized that he had gone deaf and partially blind.</p>
<p>"Ask him what happened," Pomri asked.</p>
<p><em>W-H-A-T-H-A-P-P-</em>, he paused me, signaling that he understood.</p>
<p>"I was at the observatory–," he winced at some pain in his body. "…Holrag. Had a m-m-message t-to send; a m-m-m of great importance. I didn't make it, did I?… That's-s okay though. Now you're h-h-here."</p>
<p>"That's great, Jathi," said Pomri, "What was the message?"</p>
<p><em>W-H-A-T-W-A-S-M-E-S</em></p>
<p>"The message?… The mess-KA'TOVA-essage. Many. Message… M-m-many ka'tova -essage."</p>
<p>"Ka'Tova? What about a Ka'Tova?" said Pomri, urgently.</p>
<p>She moved closer to him, holding the illuminated hand to her face so he could read her lips.</p>
<p>"Try to remember," she demanded.</p>
<p>"S-sai-sll," he cried under his breath. "I can't…can't…"</p>
<p>"Sail? From a boat?" she asked, "What does a ka'tova have to do with it?"</p>
<p>"Remember… rem -m -m."</p>
<p>He began to hit his head in frustration, but Pomri held his arms back after a few hits, and he stopped gesticulating. Instead, his pupils began to constrict and we watched as his mind began to slip backward in time.</p>
<p>"Come on," she said, worried, "Stay awake."</p>
<p>As quickly as he slipped under, he slipped back into reality.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" he demanded, "…I-I have nothing to give – go away!"</p>
<p>He turned and shuffled away from us with his hand still holding the back of his head. A fit of violent coughing overcame him as if he had been struggling to hold it in and he was forced to rest against a boulder to regain his breath, still holding his free hand out to ward us off.</p>
<p>"Leave me be," he growled, almost whispering.</p>
<p>Pomri was insistent. She approached him, trying to reassure him that she was not there for malice. But he refused her, curling up into himself. With each refusal, she broke down a little bit more until she finally knealt before him and wept. At a safe distance, he resumed his nodding and gesticulating, a hand still behind his head.</p>
<p>I knealt near Pomri a while with my hand on her back, imagining the kind of man he might have been, who he might have loved. I didn't know Jathi, but Pomri seemed to hold him in high regard.</p>
<p>"There is no justice to deliver," she said under her breath. "No greater good that could ever make this right."</p>
<p>I could feel the weight of her words stirring the same fire and vitriol that she felt in her own heart. If this was the end of life on Palinan, we would not surely not go out as a flickering flame, but as frozen statues on a battlefield of our creation.</p>
<p>Then Pomri asked me, "Linyu. Do you have any more kanosin?"</p>
<p>I hesitated, confused for a moment.</p>
<p>"It… it won't work"</p>
<p>"Won't work. What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Kanosin… can reverse death. But memories…"</p>
<p>She spoke in earnest, "He can make new memories. In a new life. One without pain."</p>
<p>"Without pain…" I murmured.</p>
<p>I dug into my satchel, ensuring that there was only one left and I produced it with the accompanying syringe. I filled the syringe while she tore off a large piece of her guard trousers, exposing more of the leg she had illuminated, and wiped it clean from ash. A brief struggle found him on his side as she bound his arms behind him and elevated his head with her satchel below his neck. He no longer fought. Perhaps he had come to accept his anticipated death. She accepted the syringe from my hand with no sign of reluctance. Perhaps she had come to understood that the virtue of a thing is in its use.</p>
<p>"The left heart, five fingers from the center," I said, reassuringly. "Directly in."</p>
<p>She nodded, measuring with her fingers, priming the syringe, and plunging the needle into his heart. Jathi's eyes began to dilate as a faint blue glow, obscured by skin, filled his body and all of his muscles settled into the land.</p>
<p>"What happens now?"</p>
<p>It was best not to tell her the truth.</p>
<p>"Sleep. For a whole day."</p>
<p>"And then he rises?"</p>
<p>"And then he rises."</p>
<p>Pomri unbound his wrists and wrapped the cloth around Jathi's head to cushion against the wound. With a quick lift, she lofted him up and let him rest gently over her shoulder.</p>
<p>"Let's take him home."</p>
<p>The blue light in Pomri's hand illuminated a heavily damaged sign beside the path. <em>eik…servato… Ara</em></p>
<p>She looked it over in detail and said, "looks like it's far enough from the city that the explosion left it intact for the most part."</p>
<p>"I've been here before," I said, remembering bits and pieces from the night I was found.</p>
<p>"Melna mentioned that she found you somewhere around here."</p>
<p>She approached the sign and prefaced her actions</p>
<p>"Before we go…"</p>
<p>With one hand, she broke off the long piece of wood that said <em>eik</em> and cut it into a thinner piece with the blade of her spear, making sure to smooth out any potential splinters or hanging sharp bits.</p>
<p>"Use this for stability," she said, holding one of the pieces out to me. I took it in my hands and looked for the word. It too, had been smoothed out.</p>
<p>"Come on," she said. "The quicker we move, the quicker we rest."</p>
<p>My legs ached twice as much when I presented them with the idea of walking upward, but I regaled them with thoughts of soft chairs and warm beds and we reached a arrangement.</p>
<p>The mountain was dead save for a few blots of shrubbery that grew in the crevasses facing Ara. They were on their way out. The absence of wind is what took me by surprise. No cold bites or violent gusts. Just stagnant air and the dust that hung upon it. Ahead of Pomri, my legs lit the way. In a way, her presence behind me was my motivation to push through the aches in my legs and feet. I feared her anger.</p>
<p>At a wide area of the cliff, we paused for Pomri to take a break and change her carry.</p>
<p>"The mountain was shorter a day ago," she said, as she laid Jathi down with the gentlest of movements.</p>
<p>I was confused. "Shorter? How?"</p>
<p>She chuckled as she took a sip from her canteen. "No.. It's a joke."</p>
<p>"I don't get it." I really didn't.</p>
<p>"It's…" she sighed, "Nevermind."</p>
<p>I pondered how a mountain could grow overnight. <em>Pomri is so weird.</em></p>
<p>The view from up here was clear, facing to the south, toward the bay and eventually Holrag. I could see patterns in the land: rocks that had tumbled across the landscape, carving lines and divots that all met at the center of the crater. There were some trees dotting the land between farms, but a particular tree caught my attention. It stood tall, guarded from the blast by the hill and home adjacent. Its branches grew wide in a semihemisphere with leaves that were densely packed though many had begun to fall. I knew the patterns of this one when I had met Melna.</p>
<p>"Pomri, is that where Melna lives?" I pointed to the place in question.</p>
<p>She looked for it for a moment and understood what I was pointing toward.</p>
<p>"Yea! That's where she took you the night she found you. Good eye."</p>
<p>"About Liffa… Did thi know about radio?"</p>
<p>"Radio? No, no one's been talking to trees that I know of. Apparently it has a song in the mornings though, when the dew is beginning to evaporate."</p>
<p>"The mornings," I said. "My mother used to sing in the morning too when we lived in the forest."</p>
<p>"Thing's been singing and growing for at least three generations. Looks to be even older than that. Sort of a legend in town – Glad it survived."</p>
<p>With the same gentleness she had shown him before, she took Jathi upon her back while I stared at the tree.</p>
<p>"Oi. Come on," she beckoned.</p>
<hr />
<p>The observatory was not as I expected it. There were no windows to be broken or walls to be split. It had been built into the ground, or perhaps the ground had been built around it. A set of three large metallic hatches protruded from the ground on the side facing Ara, closed to the elements. On the Ulu-side was a simple-looking wooden entryway with a wooden bell hung from a thick rope. Whether out of habit or the desire for some normalcy, Pomri jostled the wooden bell three times. Eager to rest, I lifted the latch and opened the door before she could finish her announcement of arrival.</p>
<p>I found a warm area in middle of the room, where a carpet had been laid between two chairs, and sprawled out on the floor, removing my shawl and bag after.</p>
<p>"I'm sooo tiiiired," I said, stretching my limbs. My heavy breathing was more noticeable in the quiet of the place.</p>
<p>Pomri knealt down beside me and gently rested Jathi on the ground. She ventured to some dark corner of the room, as if distinctly familiar with this place, and returned with a pillow in her hands. Slowly, her hands raised Jathi's cold glowing body and gently rested it upon the pillow.</p>
<p>"You can sleep later," she glanced at me with her voice. "Come, we need to look for the message."</p>
<p>Her dark lantern rocked about with a subtle metallic creak as she rummaged through the place, moving quickly in the dark but never missing a step. A modest hearth with an empty pot took up the back side of the one room building. To the left and right was the rest of it, mostly instruments and tools and shelves full of records.</p>
<p>"Ah!" she exclaimed, moving to a workbench. From a cabinet underneath, she pulled a large, thick, glass canister and popped a cork with her fingers. As she poured its contents into the lantern's upper tank, a distinctively floral aroma filled the room.</p>
<p>"What <em>is</em> that?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Oil of Anomin. It's a thick oil from the bran of anomin grains. We use it to lubricate machines, and to do this…"</p>
<p>With a firestarter just above the oil pool of her lantern, she lit the flame again and the area around her was instantly illuminated. Shadows of kanosin blue and a firey red were cast against the wood of the table and the floor, reflected on the water of her skin, swallowed by the deep black of the painted wall.</p>
<p>"Right then. Let's find this message."</p>
<p>I groaned in agony. She took a moment to glance at me, as if to hurry me without words.</p>
<p>"Sorry, o supreme leader, but your nap will have to wait."</p>
<p>She walked to the back of the room, where the strange protrusions from the outside entered the room as a row of metal cylinders. Below each one was a large table, their tops made of smoothly ground patternless stone. Pomri's hand found a mechanism that was built into the ceiling, and a faint circle suddenly appeared upon the table in front of us.</p>
<p>"This is a telescopic projector for Ara. I haven't the slightest clue how it works, but maybe you'll find something if you just play around with it."</p>
<p>She turned to move away, but stopped herself and said, "Oh, and don't put your fingers on anything glass. Jathi would be furious."</p>
<p>The knobs and levers had been polished with use and gleamed in the faint light on the table, and I looked up to her in awe. She snickered and left me to my devices while she moved to a different desk with a mess of papers that seemed to have been left in a hurry.</p>
<p>I peered at the circular light cast on the table with a discerning eye – just a blob of light; nothing particularly interesting. Just above me, a thick dial jutted out of a sturdy metal box attached to the cylinder. On the visible part were numbers that went up and down by tens. In my fingers, the dial turned smoothly and the projector seemed to slowly reveal a pattern when this dial was turned to a certain number, but I could barely make out what the image was.</p>
<p>Next to the dial was a red metal lever that seemed to fasten something. I pulled the lever and it released with a <em>tang</em> that reverberated through the metal cylinder and loosened something hidden inside. Gently, I pulled on the loosened bit and uncovered a beautiful disc of glass set into a large rectangular metallic frame. I held it up to Pomri who took a break to look my way. Through the glass she was far-away and upside-down, and to her I suppose my eye was as big as the lens itself. She may have giggled in the dark and bore a smile for just a moment, but if she did, I couldn't tell.</p>
<p>I set the lens down and searched for somewhere I might find more. Below the table was an unmarked wooden crate worn by decades of use. Inside of it, a neatly-arranged assortment of lens frames, all with varying writings on their kelp-paper envelopes. Some had much thicker lenses in them, some were tinted, and others were completely black. I inserted a few that seemed thinner and saw them make smaller, brighter circles on the table, so I decided to go the other way. At the other end of the box was the thickest lens of them all. The writing on the envelope said "First Obscura Observation | projector 4 | 5/2/11/5 6-to 12:4:0". I carefully swapped out the thin lens with this heavier large lens, making sure not to put my fingers on the glass, and closed the lever again. And When I turned the dial again to focus the image, a small but clear pattern emerged.</p>
<p>"Pomri," I called to her fearfully.</p>
<p>She came to my side and looked intently at the table. Thousands of miniscule circles of light dotted the table in a staggered formation.</p>
<p>"What kind of lens is that?"</p>
<p>"It's… a plain lens."</p>
<p>She gasped. "That's. The obscura?"</p>
<p>She moved closer and turned the focus knob to clarify the image, looking for some detail to make sense of the pattern.</p>
<p>"By Ara…"</p>
<p>The perfection of the shape, the enormity of the structure, it was like a dream of surreality within reality. The obscura was merely a figment before, some cartoonish cloud in space. But this is the moment when the weight of the obscura was unmistakeably, suffocatingly present. This was not a passing phenomenon; there was no enemy to fight or details to negotiate. This was an insuperable wall without a builder, and we stood alone in its shadow.</p>
<p>Pomri whispered, "Liffa."</p>
<p>Confused, I looked up to watch her staring deeply into the light, her finger pointing to one of the circles near the center. I leaned in to get a closer and sure enough, I saw a dot in front of one of the circles.</p>
<p>"Liffa," I said in response. "Liffa is coming home!"</p>
<p>"Jathi," Pomri had a smirk on her face, "That bastard always had an eye for hae."</p>
<p>"You don't suppose that was the message, do you?" I asked.</p>
<p>"'A message of great importance'," she said out loud. "It must be something else. Did you see any papers on this table?"</p>
<p>"I saw a black lens in the box," I told her. "There was a lot of writing on it."</p>
<p>"Show it to me."</p>
<p>I went over to the box again and pulled out the lens. It was in a darker kelp envelope with an ashwritten table of numbers on the one side. <em>Ash. A strange choice.</em> The other side was blank.</p>
<p>"Days and times," said Pomri, "What were they tracking?"</p>
<p>Her eyes moved to the last known values in the table. They were circled and seemed to be increasing.</p>
<p>"Something happened recently," she said, "Linyu, put this into the chamber. Let's see what Jathi and the others saw."</p>
<p>I took the lens, consciously feeling its weight to ensure I didn't drop it, and noticed that it was lighter than the others. Raising my hands, I prepared to take the big lens out but before I pulled the lever I noticed another one, blue and apparently new, hidden in the darkness further up the cylinder. I stared at it, confused.</p>
<p>"Everything ok?" she asked.</p>
<p>"It's a strange lens, this black one. Don't you think?"</p>
<p>"Very strange. Never seen it before. Must be a custom piece that Jathi had made recently."</p>
<p>On a gut feeling, I held the black lens up to the light shining on the table, and all of the light disappeared, as expected.</p>
<p>"This doesn't make sense," I said.</p>
<p>Pomri moved the envelope closer to read the table again and find some sort of clue and at the corner, a green speck of light appeared where the projector had shone before.</p>
<p>"Pomri! Move the envelope into the light," I said.</p>
<p>and as she shifted it, the same patterns as before began to emerge in green light, but blurry and hazy.</p>
<p>"Ah!" I said as I turned to reach for the blue lever. With a great deal of effort, I flipped it open to reveal an empty chamber and loaded the black glass. Immediately the pattern emerged on the envelope in the same green hue.</p>
<p>"Invisible light," I said aloud. My mind was full of connections.</p>
<p>"Hm. What's this?" said Pomri, her hand in the envelope. A collection of blank papers appeared in her hand, with a mess of indents that seemed to suggest that there was some sort of writing on it.</p>
<p>"Put it in the light," I suggested. She did so, and the writing appeared on the papers in that green hue.</p>
<p>Pomri read the messages out loud:</p>
<p>"</p>

Jathi,

I found your message and made my own projections. I am sure that we came to the same conclusion. Hopefully you abandoned your quest to find me and told someone else, but in case you haven't, I am leaving now to deliver the message to whoever I can find in the city. Hopefully the Holragi haven't gotten to it first.

I've double-checked my calculations and assumptions, and they must be correct. I still struggle to wrap my head around the immensity of the scales we're dealing with.

Lab Note

Two tova-na ago, I measured it again. The ultraviolet emission of Ara is increasing while infrared decreases, noting a shift in temperature toward a hotter star. The surface area of the obscura continues to grow linearly as well. I have no doubt that the two are linked.

I took your advice and devised a projection of what would happen to Ara if the obscura is actually a sphere instead of the disc that the Holragi observers seem to report. Your hypothesis that the stellar wind pressure would rise exponentially was correct, but the time scale is staggering. It would take many ka'tova for the temperature to rise high enough. I am just an apprentice observer, and certainly am no engineer, but I believ that there is a point at which the obscura can no longer hold itself together and it will break. The exact timing of this depends on how the obscura is constructed, but once this happens, it will send the obscura hurtling away from Ara at an unimaginable speed. And without a doubt, this would send a flurry of radiation to Palinan.

Our people are resilient, but we're talking a hundred lifetimes (give or take about twenty)... nothing could last that long without Ara.

<p>"</p>
<p>"A hundred lifetimes," I said, struggling to imagine a time so vast.</p>
<p>But Pomri seemed agitated, angry almost. She stuffed the notes back into the envelope and removed the ultraviolet filter, reverting the projector to its old, normal state. Its light seemed to illuminate the desk much more after being in dim light for a while, casting shadows of ourselves upon the walls.</p>
<p>"We found the message. Let's go back to Ulukoma."</p>
<p>"Shouldn't we take him with us?" I used my nose to point at Jathi.</p>
<p>"He'll be fine here."</p>
<p>"But the Holragi. His memories."</p>
<p>She lowered herself to me and looked intently into my eyes.</p>
<p>"We have to go," she said. Behind her eyes, she whispered, "He's a dead man."</p>
<p>While Pomri packed away a few useful supplies she found around the room, I gently set the filter on the table and found a nearly unused swatch of soft fabric I had found at another desk. Before putting it away, I noticed that a black dot had emerged in one of the circles, drifting from one side of the circle to another, small enough to be easily missed.</p>
<p>"Liffa," I said under my breath, and I imagined embracing this stranger that I felt I'd known my whole life. I turned the envelope over in my hands, thinking this would be the lens Jathi used to track Liffa, and sure enough I saw a note scribbled at the bottom in regular black ink - barely visible except at an angle of reflection.</p>
<pre><code>Liffa Return Trajectory

On Obscura tova 0.9, I inspected the spacerail and The agreed and checked trajectory is as follows:

First Bleed Entry: Over Heiko Center, Obscura + tova 4.3.7
Second Bleed Entry: Over Holragi-Spacerail, Obscura + tova 4.7.12
Final Approach: Ulukoma - Ulu Lao 2-ka, Obscura + tova 4.11.6

- Jathi

(Godspeed, Liffa)
</code></pre>
<p>"4.11.6. Ulukoma - Ulu Lao 2-ka" I said aloud as I wrote on my arm. "You are not forgotten, Liffa. I'm coming for you."</p>
<p>I packed my things while Pomri wrote a note for Jathi, in the inevitable case that he woke up disoriented and confused. We didn't know if he'd understand language or writing when he woke, but it was worth a try. Even for a dead man.</p>
<p>The door ushered us back out into the dark and the cold, but in my mind I was still there, lingering on the image of the motionless man, helplessly grasping at a thousand failures to help in his darkest moments. Before the dust swallowed the observatory, I went back to the moment I recognized his nodding silhouette, recalled his phantom pains and ashen face. I internalized the broken man. And I promised myself never to forget.</p></div>

<p>"Laen!" I called out. There was no answer, no sign. Not even his giant footsteps stuck around in the dust.</p>
<p>"This is the place we left him, right?" I asked. I knew it was.</p>
<p>"Perhaps he got thirsty," said Pomri, "Went to Rudjan for a drink."</p>
<p>"No. That's not like him. He must have had a good reason."</p>
<p>"Well, anyway, we need to get moving."</p>
<p>"Let's wait just a little while longer."</p>
<p>I could hear her incredulity. "You care so much for that saffa."</p>
<p>"He cares for me. Why should I not treat him the same?"</p>
<p>"He's a saffa. In Holrag, they eat saffas, you know."</p>
<p>I shuddered at the thought.</p>
<p>"He has a mind," I said. "He's capable of love. Of suffering. And every feeling in between. He's shown me the good that life is capable of. That's enough for me."</p>
<p>"Can't argue with that," she said. "Anyway, we need to get moving before the Holragi come back to ransack the place."</p>
<p>I weighed the options, and realized she was right. Being captured or killed wouldn't help us find each other again. So I stood up and trudged onward, pulled through my mental viscidity by the unstoppable force that was Pomri.</p>
<p>"Don't look back," she said as I glanced over my shoulder one last time. "You'll only make it worse."</p>
<hr />
<p>Pomri took one look at the shore near the cove and knew that something was amiss. There seemed to be a distinct and imprecise absence of rock and sand, as if a struggle had taken place.</p>
<p>"No," she said, worried. "No. Not the boat."</p>
<p>She lit her lantern with haste and checked the area for evidence of movement.</p>
<p>"A path has been carved out of the land here. And look!"</p>
<p>She pointed to a trail of blood with light specks of kanosin that led into the cove.</p>
<p><em>Specks? Peculiar.</em></p>
<p>I kneeled down to get a closer look, and before I noticed, she entered the cove. I had to follow.</p>
<p>"This. This is not good," she said as she searched everywhere for the canoe we had arrived on. I saw the divot where it had been, with streaks of dark volcanic plankton running down into the water. It was clear it had been stolen.</p>
<p>"DAMN IT ALL!" she said, pushing me aside and rushing out of the cove to search for it on the horizon. I turned around again to follow her, but my breath gave way to exhaustion and my legs felt an ache they had never felt before. I trudged slowly to the entrance and fell to a kneal, unable to move any further. I watched on as the faint blue light in Pomri's hand bobbed and swayed with each step, constantly looking out for a boat, receding into the evening light along the shore to Rudjan. Until it stopped.</p>
<p>My eyes tried to focus on the blue glow as a dozen bright amber spotlights suddenly came alive from a place in the water. <em>Slavers!</em></p>
<p>"Pomri!" I said, quickly rising to my feet. But my muscles refused to work enough to muster a run, much less a sprint. The blue glow was blotted out by the amber lights, and I could see her in full light now, holding her spear defensively. A crew of five spotlights emerged from the one, holding their lights to her, and the minute they set foot on land, she sprung into action, taking the first one head-on. But the other four quickly bound her with weighted nets and wrested her spear away with a rope anchor. She grappled with another, but her hand was met with a dagger and ankles were tied in the blink of an eye. "Pomri!" I called out to her, and immediately two of the amber lights turned my way, impaling the dark with their beams. Somehow, the distance between us had become immeasurable in an instant, as if some illusion had been cast on my eyes. Without a pause, they ran after me but I just stood there, my mind faltering and petrified in their light.</p>
<p>From behind me, a voice called "Aye!" and a small army of feet pattered against the rock. I huddled in anticipation, but the steps passed by me and charged ahead toward the lights. Through the lantern lights, I saw their silhouettes: a maman dressed in a dark and tattered robe with a paddle in hae hand; two saffas were further ahead, galloping their quickest toward the lights emerging from the water.</p>
<p>Across the beach, the maman scaled the darkness and took the two slavers by surprise. The struggle played out only a few paces before me. The sound of breaking glass rang out; one of the lanterns was extinguished. The other flailed about as if reaching to land a blow upon any sign of movement. Between the commotion of sound and the bright washed out patterns in my eyes, nothing was clear, but I knew that thi had given me the chance to flee to safety. <em>The cove</em>. With what little strength that remained in my limbs, I crawled back and waited just inside the mouth of the tunnel for some sign of friend or foe.</p>
<p>The commotion outside came to a stop, and I saw the last light flicker and fade. From the eerie calm, a sound began. Some heavy object being scraped against the rock and then a splash, shallow but just enough. Then again. The sweet smell of Anomin oil mingled with the salty mist in my nose. And I could have sworn that such a pleasant pair of odors came together to taste like metal at the back of my throat. I did not like it.</p>
<p>Cautiously, I emerged from my hiding, tracing the edge of the beach toward where I thought the sounds had come from. The amber lights both near and far had vanished and I could barely see the ground at this time of day. I could hear the sounds of shifting pebbles at a distance, the saffas finding their way back. In front of me, upon a flat rock jutting out from the shore, the maman had flung haeself with hae back to the sky, breathing heavily through hae teeth.</p>
<p>I began, "Are-"</p>
<p>But thi pulled the paddle from beside hae and raised it to my neck in the blink of an eye. Through the blue light, I could see hae eyes, narrowed and hyper-aware.</p>
<p>I chill of trembles shook my body with fear. "Are you alright?" I asked.</p>
<p>And with the same swift movement thi set the paddle down and sat back against the rock with hae lower body submerged in the little waves. I passed my hand over her and could see a makeshift bandage off damp kelp on hae abdomen, and the thick black of blood in a blue light.</p>
<p>"You're wounded," I said.</p>
<p>"I've had worse," thi said nonchalantly.</p>
<p>With a gesture of permission and a gentle motion I led my hand underneath the bandage. My fingers traced a wound, long, deep, and jagged. I looked through the eyes my mother gave me, looked inside the body with my mind, imagined hae voice present through my own. <em>Right-side filter gills are immediately below the laceration, torn. Bleeding has stopped, but hae blood is acidifying. Infection is likely. This will kill hae slowly without proper medical help.</em></p>
<p>"You need," I said panicked, "I need to get you to a doctor."</p>
<p>"I… I am too weak."</p>
<p>I reached into my bag. "I have some vials of- … I can get you to a place where you'll be safe."</p>
<p>"Nowhere is safe now."</p>
<p>"There is such a place," I reassured hae, "It's hidden, in the darkness. The Holragi wouldn't know to go to Ulukoma."</p>
<p>"The underworld…" thi looked through me as hae thoughts drifted off. "I'm not going back."</p>
<p><em>Underworld?</em></p>
<p>"I don't know of any underworld. There is a doctor there that can help you."</p>
<p>Hae eyes turned back to reality. "A doctor has no business with the dead."</p>
<p>"But you aren't dead."</p>
<p>Thi looked at me with cold, untrusting eyes. A saffa approached, growling at the blue light from my hand until the maman spoke.</p>
<p>"It's ok," she said with a gentle tone. The saffa immediately stopped growling and shook its head with a jingling sound.</p>
<p>"I found you!" I yelled to him, and he let out a loud, "Woooooop!"</p>
<p>From a distance, the other saffa cried toward the ocean, "Wooooooooooo." It was Boon.</p>
<p>Laen and I carried the maman to the edge of the entry, where there was ample height and space from the water. Even if we were there until morning, we would've been safe from the tide.</p>
<p>"I could have stopped them," thi said as Laen made his side available as a bed for the maman.</p>
<p>"Those filthy slavers," thi explained, "They got your companion. Would've killed you. You're too small to be useful to them."</p>
<p>I apologized with a shameful silence, realizing that I had unwittingly drawn their attention.</p>
<p>"No remorse," thi said with conviction. "This isn't the time."</p>
<p>I was grateful for hae thinking so, but the guilt held fast. I spoke in a broken voice, "Pomri is… a slave now. She can't escape."</p>
<p>"Be still, maman. Quiet your mind."</p>
<p>"I've been begging it to stop!"</p>
<p>"There's nothing could be done to save her, and no way to take it back."</p>
<p>I drew closer and knealt by hae side while Boon let out another howl in the distance. It shook me.</p>
<p>Thi asked me, "What's your name, young maman?"</p>
<p>"L-Linyu," I said, "My name is Linyu."</p>
<p>Thi introduced herself, "The one that came before me was named Ginnu."</p>
<p>"Ginnu…" I said, hiding that I'd known hae before.</p>
<p>"To me, Ginnu died and is forgotten. I am <em>Annu</em>, one without a name."</p>
<p>"Annu…" I repeated but did not understand. A pendant around hae neck caught my eye and unraveled my curiosity. I took a closer look to make sure it was the genuine article.</p>
<p>"You knew… Melna?" I asked.</p>
<p>"What happened to her?" thi asked in a subdued sort of excitement, "How do you know her?"</p>
<p>A brief glimpse of her death flashed in my mind, and all the myriad emotions that went with it, crammed into a moment. Ginnu saw my stare, heard my silence, and understood.</p>
<p>"She took me in when I woke up in Heiko," I said, grasping at my own voice for answers, "We fled with Pomri to Rudjan, but then we were separated. Pomri wounded a slaver that tried to kidnap me, so we hid and fled back to Heiko."</p>
<p>A wave of pride flowed through me. "I heard Melna on my listener. Speaking to all of us. She prepared her people for what was to come. And she bought us Ulukomai enough time to save most of them."</p>
<p>"How did she die?" Thi asked, turning her head toward me. I remained silent but hae gaze held its link to me.</p>
<p>"The last time I saw her, she was fighting with their leader. A tall man with a fancy stick. I couldn't help, else I would have been shot like some of the others."</p>
<p>Thi returned hae head to comfortable. "Nothing would have stopped her," thi said. "She knew her people were in danger and that was enough."</p>
<p>In a slow gesture, thi grasped my hands with hae own and held silence between our palms. I searched for her spirit, for Kipnu and Pomri, for my mother. But there was only absence.</p>
<p>"Melna saved me," thi said. "I was… on a ship. I woke up blind and disoriented, in a satchel underneath the deck of a ship. I didn't even know my own name."</p>
<p>I took note of the kanosin blue in hae eyes: faint but evident. If thi had been given antikan, then thi must have had another dose of kanosin afterward. But how?</p>
<p>"Every so often, a man would come down and ask me strange questions about someone I never knew and if I didn't know the answer he would cut me open and leave me to bleed out on the floor until I woke up again, the floor having been washed anew. He trapped me there, teetering between life and death. I died so many times I can no longer remember. But always, life was at the other end."</p>
<p>"You… can't die?"</p>
<p>"It is an illness, and I would rather be rid of it. I fear life, for life means another death is coming."</p>
<p>I was aghast by what thi was saying. A gift so powerful was wasted on someone who wished it gone. That most evil of thoughts crossed my mind, too. To exchange the life of a friend for that of an acquaintence. But I stopped myself from lending it any time. <em>It doesn't become me</em>, as my mother would say.</p>
<p>"What is his name?" I asked.</p>
<p>Thi paused, mustering the strength to say his name.</p>
<p>"Ramne."</p>
<p>The pores in my skin contracted.</p>
<p>Thi took a deep, painful breath.</p>
<p>"Ginnu once loved him, or so he would tell me. I used to think that meant I had to find a way to love him again. That recovering my past life would make me whole again. But Melna saw the new me, the real me. 'Your body is a vessel for the many lives that may fill and empty through it,' she told me. 'Whatever may have filled it before does not affect the beauty that fills it now.' She gave me the gift of sight by some magic potion in that glass vial."</p>
<p><em>Parnu kept his word. But now thi Annu was vulnerable. A death no would surely be hae last.</em></p>
<p>"She set me free in more ways than one. I owe her my life and any that come after to her."</p>
<p>The thought came to me again, this time with a wonder if I might lose Annu too. Maybe I shouldn't be so invested.</p>
<p>"Gi- Annu. We need to find the boat so we can–"</p>
<p>"The boat is… gone."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"He… took it," thi said. Her voice was cryptic and longing tone.</p>
<p>"Who"</p>
<p>"Ramne. He came to the cove right after you left. I hid myself in fear."</p>
<p>"What did he want with the boat?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. The last I saw of him, he was paddling off toward Ulu."</p>
<p><em>Dammit</em></p>
<p>"We need to follow him. I think he might be going to Ulukoma to start something."</p>
<p>"I… I can't go back."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"I have visions sometimes. Like a memory that I forgot. There is a place of darkness where life and death no longer hold any meaning. I'm a ghost there, one of millions. And he's there too. I can't see them but I can feel them. All of us are aware of our deaths. But we are at peace knowing it."</p>
<p>Hae eyes returned their gaze to me.</p>
<p>"The vision ends under the dark sky of Ulu, looking out from that cursed ship at an island that gets smaller and smaller. I feel like I've been there a thousand times, yet still it doesn't feel like home. I am afraid of what I might find there."</p>
<p>"Annu, you don't have to come with me but I must go. My nather and my people are in danger."</p>
<p>Thi looked through me, into the void, terrified at the imaginings in hae head.</p>
<p>Thi pleaded to me, "I will go with you if you promise me something, young maman."</p>
<p><em>Maman… I'd never been called that.</em></p>
<p>"If you see Ramne, or hear of him. Run. Run far far away and never come back."</p>
<p>"What about you?"</p>
<p>"You heard me."</p>
<p>Hae stories shook me. Why would Ramne do such awful things to someone? What was his end goal?</p>
<p>The sound of distant waves and the tiny plops of water on rocky puddles filled me, carrying me back into my thoughts. Annu saw that I was thinking deeply and held my hand, calmed me with the warmth of hae touch and the sound of hae voice.</p>
<p>"Your hearts are full," thi said running hae fingers through my hair. Hae voice was like a pool of warm water in the frozen air.</p>
<p>"Full of fear," I replied.</p>
<p>"And of love. You cared for Melna. And you care for Pomri. More than you care for yourself. But you are conflicted. You have his eyes. Cunning, determined. You see the flow of old and new, a vast continuum upon which life wanders. You will be a great leader someday, in a time long from now, where everything old has been lost, and make room for the new."</p>
<p>I tried to understand what thi was saying, but I was frustrated. "I have no power, no talents. I command respect from no one. How can I lead without–"</p>
<p>"Shh…," thi said. "You will see what I can see. One day."</p>
<p>I took a few deep breaths and set my mind back into the calm of its deepest parts. Pomri came to mind and the frantic feeling took hold again. I stood up, contemplating what her life might be like from now on. And then I remembered the stories my nather told me: of mining for ore, escaping from Holrag. And I couldn't hold in my anger any longer.</p>
<p>"They're still out there, hunting us down," I said, standing up. Instinctively, I began to pace around in a circle, holding a head full of the worst imagined thoughts. "All of Heiko has been exiled, enslaved, murdered. They didn't want to live the last of their days in the shadow of a tyrant. So the tyrant erased them."</p>
<p>I was angry now, recalling every injustice, every act of intimidation and coercion.</p>
<p>"We need to fight back. We need to go after Pomri."</p>
<p>"You can't track a boat that travels underwater."</p>
<p>"Dammit!!" I screamed and my voice reverberated across the walls, reaching into every corner and every rock. "I'm not losing another one. Not again!"</p>
<p>A soft whine echoed faintly through the air, joined by a chorus of heavy footsteps upon the pebbles.</p>
<p>"Boon…"</p>
<p>She walked slowly to us, sniffed on me and laid herself next to Laen with a deep sigh. There was an air of despair in that cove that I had never felt before: the feeling of giving everything for nothing. Not for a lack of effort or willpower, but a lack of access to technology. But in that same space, we opened our hearts for some kind of hope that wait for us in the darkness. It drove us just enough to not want to end it all.</p>
<p>Annu let haeself onto the floor in front of Boon, trying to comfort her with gentle pats of her shoulder.</p>
<p>"Linyu," thi beckoned me to sit.</p>
<p>"This time is full of evil," thi said, "All of us have been caught in an undercurrent of lies. Of mighty forces vying for the last bits of power left in the world. And people who would end and enslave countless lives in order to save themselves for one more day."</p>
<p>I silently agreed.</p>
<p>"There is one problem which binds all these things together."</p>
<p>I realized in an instant what she meant, and the disparate knowings that jumbled round in my head began to make sense.</p>
<p>"The obscura," I said.</p>
<p>Thi nodded. "There is another time, far beyond the horizon we see in this one."</p>
<p>"A hundred lifetimes," I whispered.</p>
<p>Thi said, "we cannot defeat our enemies in this time."</p>
<p>"but we can outlast them until the next," I said. And I smirked with vigor at our words.</p>
<p>"But first," she interjected, "Let's get some rest. We'll be safe here for a while."</p>
<p>I took the spot at Laen's warm belly and he let out a satisfied "oo". Throughout the night, I thought about Pomri. Grieved at the fate that lie before her. But then I thought of my nather, and all the others in Ulukoma who were waiting for a sign of hope. I took Annu's words into my heart through the water of grief on my cheeks and in my eyes. And my lungs had never felt so full of life.</p></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter28">Chapter 28</h2>
<p>A light shone through the entry of the cove and disturbed me from my sleep.</p>
<p>"Annu," I whispered to her, "Do you see that?"</p>
<p>But thi remained in a deep slumber that I thought it best not to disturb. I gently sat myself up and emerged from Laen's nestling space, and crept quietly along the pebbles toward the water. A faint pillar of orange and infrared shone upon the ocean's surface, glittering between the wave crests. I looked up and saw a faint flame emerging from the dust cloud of Heiko, painting an arc of fire across the sky.</p>
<p>"Liffa…" I whispered to the air with parched lips. "What an awful thing to be greeted with."</p>
<p>I held closely to the listener on my ear, trying to find a pattern in the noise. But there was nothing but static and the howl of wind upon my skin. The bright arc grew steadily fainter and fainter, then faded again into the night.</p>
<p>"8 Tova'la left," I said to myself, recalling the times Jathi had confirmed.</p>
<p>"You are not forgotten."</p>
<p>I looked back at Laen sleeping face-to-face with Boon, wondered what they felt when they thought about Liffa or Pomri, if explaining it to them would be possible, or if it would even help. Maybe they simply trusted us to make things good in the end. I couldn't bear to tell them the truth.</p>
<p>With quiet steps I walked outside, being careful not to wander too far from cove. There was nary a sign of the scuffle that Annu had saved me from. The pebbles had been shuffled and the bodies reclaimed by the many fingers of the ocean. I searched the shoreline for the place where Pomri had been taken, but couldn't find it. The water had erased any evidence of its happening, without which virtue could hold no contempt.</p>
<p>"Good Morning, Linyu," called Annu from afar.</p>
<p>"You're walking now," I said in amazement, and noticed that thi had a caution with which thi took hae steps.</p>
<p>"Only just," thi said nonchalantly, "My eyes are taking on the blue again, and I can't sleep."</p>
<p>"The visions?"</p>
<p>Thi nodded. As thi walked closer, I could see the faint speckles growing in magnitude and number. I understood then how thi came to never die. That kanosin seemed to be growing inside of hae somehow. I came to hae and gestured on hae skin toward the kelp bandage on hae wound.</p>
<p>"…May I?" I asked.</p>
<p>Thi nodded, understanding my curiosity was for hae health. The bandage stuck well to hae skin, but I managed to peel a bit of it and saw only a mild scar. A swell of coruscating blue dots lie directly underneath.</p>
<p>"Well, go on," thi said, gesturing to the bandage. Slowly, I peeled it away to reveal the entire scar. Somehow, one could tell that it had healed quickly; the skin seemed to grow at different rates, leaving a misshapen, jagged crevasse of young hydroderm. Around the old scar were older ones, some small, some large. There were far more than I could count in the moment before thi closed hae robes.</p>
<p>"Come now. Let's get you back to Ulukoma," thi said.</p>
<p>"We need a ship," I noted. "For the saffas."</p>
<p>"A ship would be difficult to find and even harder to steal. Two canoes should suffice."</p>
<p>I thought thi was joking at first, but a glance showed thi was serious.</p>
<p>"A saffa in a canoe?"</p>
<p>"I've seen them in the water. They could swim the whole way to Ulukoma if the water wasn't so cold."</p>
<p>I imagined Boon and Laen swimming, their fuzzy heads jutting above the waves and wide paws pushing against the current. It looked so strange in my head, but I conceded that two canoes might be our only option.</p>
<p>"Rudjan," thi said, "That's the only place we'll be able to find them."</p>
<p>I imagined the impenetrable walls of Rudjan. How they filled out into the ocean to divide the throngia from the saffas and tilmarims; at least that's what Pomri had told me.</p>
<p>I looked over to Annu and asked, "You've been to Rudjan, right?"</p>
<p>"Yea…" thi said, thinking the same thing. "Well what if– … no… but…"</p>
<p>I interrupted hae, "Even if we could pass the wall, we'll face many more obstacles. If we get caught, it means death or enslavement. There has to be another way."</p>
<p>"Shh- do you hear that?" thi said. For once I wasn't the first to hear a thing.</p>
<p>I removed the listener and put my ear to the air. In the dead air, I could hear the sound of lazy oars splashing through the slush out of time.</p>
<p>"Slavers?" I asked Annu.</p>
<p>"No. They couldn't carry anything in a row boat. Must be stragglers from the blockade."</p>
<p>In the darkness of the ocean, six lanterns suspended on the crooks of Rudjani boats appeared, and a maman's voice was barely audible, "-n lao'a … stea 'ose 'addles."</p>
<p>Annu's face widened immediately, as if a flurry of disparate thoughts were connecting themselves all at once. Thi yelled, "Shinna!" with a bellow as if hae belly no longer hurt.</p>
<p>The oars cut back to a silence, but no response came.</p>
<p>"You know them?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I know that voice, I heard it often when I was stowed away on Ramne's ship."</p>
<p>"How do you know we can trust them?"</p>
<p>"There's a reason Ramne had to steal a boat."</p>
<p>"Shinna!" thi yelled again. "It's Ginnu!"</p>
<p>The water remained silent for a moment more, then began with quiet disquiet, rummaging through the water. The sound followed a path toward the shore some fifty paces toward Rudjan. I looked to Annu who looked back at me with hae hand extended in a gesture of fellowship. I took it in mine, and together we walked along the shoreline toward the place where they were about to land.</p>
<p>Three boats slid to a stop upon the sandy sea floor, their crew sitting forward on the benches, sprawled out upon their oarshafts to relieve their muscles. A maman hopped down from the back of the middle boat with a rope and lantern, and waded toward the land trying to make out anything identifiable.</p>
<p>"Is anyone there?" thi called to the darkness, "Ginnu?"</p>
<p>Annu waited for a moment, observing hae with caution. Thi opened up once thi felt ready, "Shinna, over here!"</p>
<p>The maman paused and looked our way, hae eye catching the both of us.</p>
<p>"Ginnu! is that really you?" thi exclaimed. Annu and I waded out to meet hae voice, while Shinna waded as far as hae rope would allow.</p>
<p>"Melna told me what happened," said Shinna. There was a guilt about hae voice. "I didn't believe what she said until I saw the evidence."</p>
<p>"I owe her everything."</p>
<p>Shinna turned hae sight toward me, and then toward something behind me. I turned to see Laen and Boon walking toward us.</p>
<p>"Looks like you've met some friends."</p>
<p>"Linyu and these saffas have been throught a lot," thi said with an air of endearment. "But I'm glad they found me."</p>
<p>"Let me find a rock 'n we can talk more on land."</p>
<p>Thi found a sturdy rock to bind the rope to and with a few flicks of the wrist thi commuted a series of loops along the length of the rope, pulling it to and fro. As if from nowhere, a wide knot encircled the rock and held fast. I gasped in awe while Annu pulled me from my trance out of the cold water.</p>
<p>"Ginnu," Shinna began awkwardly, "I… I'm sorry I never checked on you."</p>
<p>"Don't," thi swallowed hae emotions. "It exists only in the past. Leave it there."</p>
<p>"He promised us that you were a friend. That you wanted to remain discreet."</p>
<p>"I can't fault you for things you didn't know."</p>
<p>"It's my duty to know what happens on my ship."</p>
<p>"Shinna, you can sulk about it all you want, but the past is the past. I'm done with that man. and I'd like it to stay that way."</p>
<p>Thi bowed hae head, hae guilt defeated.</p>
<p>Annu continued, "That name: Ginnu. It's what Ramne called me, but it's not who I am. My name is Annu."</p>
<p>"Annu… I won't forget it," thi said solemnly. "Annu and Linyu. Mamen of the dark."</p>
<p>I blushed, feeling vindicated at being called a maman again. I hadn't felt like a kaln since my mother-</p>
<p>"About your boat," Annu changed the subject, "We need a way to Ulukoma."</p>
<p>Shinna scoffed at the idea. "Why would you want to go there at a time like this?"</p>
<p>"It's… complicated. And I don't completely understand it either. But I can assure you that it's the only place left in the world for us."</p>
<p>"Bit dramatic, eh?" thi said. "My crew is already pretty demoralized. We just lost our ship to the Holragi and we've been rowing back home ever since. I couldn't very well convince them to ferry two strangers and their saffas out into colder waters on just a promise. Why don't you join us to Rudjan and then we'll get you sorted."</p>
<p>"The saffas can paddle," said Annu, pleading to Shinna with the last of hae leverage.</p>
<p>I let go of Annu's hand and stepped forward, channeling my mother's bravery, trying on my gravest voice. "You saw that arc in the sky, cutting just above Heiko City?"</p>
<p>"We did. It struck the fear in our bones, that another blast might be coming." Thi knealt to my level. "You know what it was?"</p>
<p>"Liffa," I said, "The great space pioneer. And Melna's bundmaman."</p>
<p>Thi laughed, "You expect me to believe that thing had a live human in it?"</p>
<p>But I maintained a serious face. "I found notes from Heiko's observer," I said, recalling the writing on my arm. "And I've been listening to hae communications. Thi is still up there, orbiting around the planet, but not forever. Thi is scheduled to land soon, near Ulukoma. But thi will drown unless we're there to pull hae out of the water."</p>
<p>Thi began to think, staring closely at my arm.</p>
<p>"And what about our next meal?" thi asked. "We'd love to be heroes, but even a hero needs to eat."</p>
<p>"Did you never eat with us in Ulukoma?"</p>
<p>"We never saw anyone. The crates were always waiting for us on the shore and Ramne would handle payment."</p>
<p>"The Great Pavilion was a sight to behold. We had stockpiles of bread, kelp, and smoke-dried fish for our feasts. Much of the structure was reduced to ash in the fire but the stockpiles remain, buried underground."</p>
<p>"Made by slave labor, no doubt."</p>
<p>"That's the old Ulukoma. We don't do that anymore."</p>
<p>"Yet still you benefit from their labor."</p>
<p>"It would be wasteful not to."</p>
<p>"Perhaps. But wondering what will happen when those coffers are empty."</p>
<p>"We will all be sleeping soundly in the Palace of Ghosts by then."</p>
<p>"A palace, eh? And I presume that's the place Annu was talking about?"</p>
<p>Annu and I both nodded, our minds synchronized to the mission. Thi thought some more, looking into hae mind with closed eyes and long definite breaths, much the same way my mother taught me to look into the future. Thi opened hae eyes after a tedious pause, bowed to us, and turned toward hae boat.</p>
<p>I pleaded to hae, "Let me speak to them if-"</p>
<p>"No need," thi spoke with confidence, hae hand outstretched to quiet me. "We will take you and your saffas."</p>
<p>Thi took a step but then thought of something else.</p>
<p>"But if that kelp is shit-tier, you're dead."</p>
<p>Shinna yelled out to hae crew, "Change of plans crew. We're headed toward Ulukoma for a feast! And now we have some saffas to help us paddle."</p>
<p>A random voice badgered hae from the shadow, "Can we eat the saffas?" followed by muted laughter from the rest.</p>
<p>Thi replied, "I've been told that one of them has a palate for thick-headed men like you. Perhaps you'd like to test the rumor?"</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>"Palace of Ghosts," said Annu chuckling under hae breath. Thi nudged me in the shoulder with a giant grin on hae face.</p>
<p>"What?" I asked coyly, but thi just held the grin and called the saffas.</p>
<p>Shinna led Laen and Boon onto the outer boats followed by Annu and me who laid on their backs to keep them warm and guide them. Surely as Annu had said, Laen and Boon immediately took to paddling in the water as if they had always known. Shinna's crew filled into the center boat, clearly pushing the limits of its capacity, and tethered their boat to both of ours – a sort of precaution against theft or sinking, I suppose.</p>
<p>Laen's back kept me warm as I nuzzled my face into his fur.</p>
<p>"Time to save Liffa," I whispered.</p></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter29">Chapter 29</h2>
<p>"Oi, Linyu!" Shinna called to me, "Wake up."</p>
<p>I awoke from Laen's back, groggy but functional, and laid my eyes upon my homeland, Ulukoma. Only the trees were visible in the dim twilight, blotting out the few red stars that held their flames to the waning horizon. I looked around to orient myself, and found the shoddy fishing dock that Pomri and I had left from. A mere few paces away was the boat we had left with, hanging onto a patch of sand in the low tide of morning.</p>
<p>"You were right, Annu," I yelled to her. "He's here."</p>
<p>A shudder must have overcome hae. Thi heard me, but hae focus remained on the land ahead.</p>
<p>We came to the dock and Shinna and I went through the motions with the ropes while the others caught their breath. I watched in awe again as Shinna formed a complex knot with a few quick flicks of the rope.</p>
<p>"What do you really feel about him?" I asked Shinna, "about Ramne?"</p>
<p>"'s lucrative to know a man like that, you know?" thi said with a tone of reminiscence. "He gets you hooked on the money, then one day you realize you don't know how to live without it."</p>
<p>I stayed quiet, hoping thi had something more to say.</p>
<p>"Oh no, don't get the wrong impression," thi said after a pause. "He has many hooks like that. He's gotten everyone I've ever known addicted in some way or another. Ramne is a weed; he's better off plucked."</p>
<p>"You and I both know that he will take you out the first chance he gets."</p>
<p>"Then let's make sure he can't."</p>
<p>Thi made a gesture with hae hands of plunging a syringe into hae left heart. I didn't smile.</p>
<p>Annu seemed to be a little out of sorts, still holding close to Boon whose tail was calmer than the ocean. I waded to hae boat, to help hae down.</p>
<p>"Annu, are you coming?"</p>
<p>"It's coming back to me now," thi said, looking deeply into the water.</p>
<p>"What is?" I asked, confused.</p>
<p>"When I left… It was a big ship, anchored further out. He bound me with rope and dragged me through the water while I struggled for aiir. I can feel every moment. Even the little bits of sand and bubble across my face. The water got deeper, and… there was nothing to push against. I remember the tunnel vision. That stale air was so painful to hold inside, but the water was even worse."</p>
<p>Thi began to tremble as hae eyes stared further and further into hae mind, clutching fast to Boon's fur until she yelped, "Ai!" and Annu snapped out of it.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry Boon," thi said gently.</p>
<p>I began to cry, as my own memories popped in and out of my consciousness and colored my empathy for hae.</p>
<p>Thi said, "I can never erase these memories of dying. They haunt me everywhere I go."</p>
<p>"Then don't," I implored. "Those memories will save you from going back to him."</p>
<p>"Like antikan."</p>
<p>My face flushed at the memory of my mother. <em>This is what thi would have done</em>.</p>
<p>"Yea. A bit like antikan," I said.</p>
<p>Behind us, Shinna adressed hae crew.</p>
<p>"Smell that?" thi sniffed the air catching particles of smoke from the fire that ravaged the great pavilion. "The feast awaits us!"</p>
<p>The crew howled their agreement in "Aii"s and "Ouu"s. Even Laen got into it with a long "Woooooo". All of these people deserved what they came for, but I worried about how Setre and the guardians might react to a sudden need to feed twenty sailors from Ramne's old smuggling outfit.</p>
<p>Shinna held hae hand to me, making me suddenly aware of my importance.</p>
<p>"Linyu," thi said, "lead the way."</p>
<p>I recalled the path through the trees with my feet, each step a little closer to the memory of home I knew from before Shinna. The others didn't see the forest the way I did: a continuum of cause and effect, of quiet patterns in the noise of reality. Everywhere we stepped, the ground was a mash of half-melted snow and fallen leaves, wilted by the cold snap. Even the path, tread out by the footsteps of guardians, had changed to adapt to the forest. A fallen branch since removed by the mystery of decay, a colony of diving bugs making a new home in the ground; every deviation was proof that life had endured in spite of our insistence of boundaries and borders, roads and railways. It would continue to do so.</p>
<p>Upon my arm was Annu, nearly blind from a relapse of the strange Kanosin infection thi seemed to have. Shinna's party ignored hae as if to assume thi was an addict, requiring nothing further than to know that thi had been a servant of the kanosin peddler extraordinaire. Their ignorance frustrated me; not out of pity but of disdain for their will to maintain it. I wanted to show them that Annu was good. I wanted to show them the giant wound that Annu had suffered to save me, that thi knew of a way to save us. I wanted to show them how wrong they were about hae. But I couldn't trust them yet.</p>
<p>"Ai, Linyu. How long?" asked Shinna. "The scent of smoked fish is making my belly grumble."</p>
<p><em>Not fish, you idiot.</em></p>
<p>"Not long now," I said, "I can see the fire just ahead."</p>
<p>Yes, I could see the fire, but the glow was faint – too faint to keep the injured warm, and barely large enough to cook for more than a few people – but I didn't tell the others. Their disappointment would turn them against me soon if I didn't think of something fast.</p>
<p>"Annu," I said, "We need to get out of here."</p>
<p>"Not so fast."</p>
<p>Setre's voice pierced me, and I winced in frustration. I looked toward Annu to see her spear held to hae neck.</p>
<p>"All of you – back to the shore! You'll leave immediately!"</p>
<p>Shinna approached with the swagger of a career smuggler, placing hae hand on a broadsword at hae waist. Hae crew did the same with their own weapons.</p>
<p>"Unless the food is there," thi said, "We aren't going anywhere."</p>
<p>"You'll find no food here. The ice has claimed everything."</p>
<p>Shinna threw a sour glance at me and then back at Setre, and made a subtle signal with hae arm. Hae crew moved to surround Setre, their hands still at their sides, ready to strike.</p>
<p>Thi said, "If it's nothing to you, we'd like to prove that for ourselves."</p>
<p>From the darkness a number of blue lights appeared one-by-one, surrounding us with blackened spears in their hands. Laen and Boon began to growl, but I raised my hands to calm them.</p>
<p>"The Guardians," I whispered to myself.</p>
<p>They easily outnumbered Shinna's crew, blocking them from moving forward. But suddenly, I realized my role in this and I felt immensely vulnerable. I saw Shinna looking at me with hungry eyes, calculating hae next move as if it might be hae last. From the corner of my eye, I glanced at Setre who saw Shinna drawing hae sword, but hesitated to move her blade from Annu's neck. Shinna leapt toward me, but I had reached for Annu to put myself between hae and Setre's blade and was no longer where I had been before. Shinna clutched the air, stumbling to the ground and brushing my leg with hae free hand, hae fingers narrowly catching my ankle. I fell before I made it to Annu and clawed the frosted ground to get away. A growling sound rang out, and then a cry of pain as Shinna's hand released its grip on my ankle. Setre lowered her spear and I clutched tightly to Annu. Upon the ground lie Shinna bracing hae sword hand with streaks of blood and water down hae arm, and Laen with his shadow eyes standing between hae and hae sword. I did not know where the hit had landed, but Laen knew that he had done the right thing.</p>
<p>Setre grabbed the bloodied sword from off the ground and held it up to her face.</p>
<p>"Shinna um Rudjan, eh?" Setre said rhetorically. "You think you're a captain just caus you have a fancy sword? A captain should know how to fight."</p>
<p>She took a look at the rest of the crew, all of them unmoving and unsure of what to do.</p>
<p>"I won't be so sloppy with you lot. Now turn your asses around and get out of here."</p>
<p>"Wait," I said to her, "They only came for food."</p>
<p>"Hungry?" she laughed, "Hunger begs. Greed threatens." she said, as if to quote some Holragi proverb I'd never heard.</p>
<p>"They've given us safe passage back here. Just give them some sustenance and let them be on their way."</p>
<p>She looked at Annu, at the saffas, and back to Shinna again, but not at me.</p>
<p>"We have enough mouths to feed. Rev'i, take your guardians and escort these traitors off the island. Remove their weapons before you go."</p>
<p>"We'll be defenseless!" Shinna plead, "The slavers will find us unarmed and take us in an instant!"</p>
<p>But Melna was unaffable. "The dead wield justice through the living," she said solemnly. "There is no fate harsh enough for those who betrayed Melna. You're lucky to be leaving this place alive."</p>
<p>"Wait!" Shinna yelled, "Ramne is here! I know his plan."</p>
<p>Setre paused at momentarily.</p>
<p>"My judgment is final," she said, and waved to dismiss them.</p>
<p>"Thi's telling the truth," I plead as well, but she ignored me as well.</p>
<p>A commotion stirred as Rev'i signalled and nearly a hundred blue lights approached.</p>
<p>"Fight!" said Shinna. "Fight, you cowards!"</p>
<p>But none of them were foolish enough to heed hae words. One maman raised hae sword to strike a guardian, but five others rushed in and immobilized hae arm with their spears. The others heeded Setre's words and removed their weapons.</p>
<p>Shinna looked at me with furious, smoldering eyes.</p>
<p>"Lying kaln!" thi said. "I'll never forget this!"</p>
<p>Hae voice petrified me. For the first time, I felt responsible for peoples' lives. I had led them to Ulukoma with the hope of life-giving sustenance. I knew it was a false hope, but that hope was necessary for my own ends. Shinna's crew might make it back through the icy ocean, or the cold and fatigue might get the best of them. They were not faultless but they did not deserve this.</p>
<p>Setre took one step toward me and pulled Annu's hand from mine, silent but for audible thoughts her scowl conjured within my mind. With a tug she moved Annu to her other side, causing hae to stumble, but Setre held Annu's body up with one hand, never letting hae go.</p>
<p>"What are you doing with hae?" I asked.</p>
<p>She didn't respond.</p>
<p>"What are you doing with hae?!" I yelled, pulling my nather's spear arm, but she shoved me away saying nothing to me. Behind me, Boon snarled at my nather. Laen snorted to her, trying to calm her down, and I raised my hand to reassure Boon that everything was okay. But she trusted neither of us. She darted off toward Setre, kicking up dirt and twigs as she flew past me. Laen hesitated, glancing at me to look for guidance, but I gave him none. He decided for himself that he had to follow after Boon.</p>
<p>I watched them disappear into the night after Setre, looked back at the guardians' light ebb into the darkness. I felt history repeat itself in a different hues. It was the same pattern in Pomri's capture, in Fajro's plan, in Shinna's form. A pattern of people trying to see through the darkness, blindly taking everything they can - even other people. I felt the pain of all who were lost in it: like cuts that bled together. Like kanosin and blood.</p>
<p>A hand fell upon my shoulder. "Quite the ruler, isn't she?" said Ramne.</p>
<p>I turned around, tripping over a rock in the darkness. I looked for Laen and Boon, but they were long gone.</p>
<p>"I must admit: when I was the leader of her faction, I didn't think much of Setre. But when Casra ran off with you to Rudjan, all the rage she hid inside of her came out. Must be something in that Holragi blood."</p>
<p>"Go away," I said, shrugging him off and hiding my fear. "I don't have time."</p>
<p>I headed back toward the shore, hoping to pull him away from Annu and toward the Guardians.</p>
<p>"Now now," he said raising a dagger to my neck, "You're still a kaln. You've got plenty of time."</p>
<p>I stopped abruptly to avoid the blade.</p>
<p>He explained to me, "We've got a lot of catching up to do. So many things you missed while you were out."</p>
<p><em>Out? Was he there?</em></p>
<p>"Your nather is a tough cookie, you know? I figured she'd die in the fire or at least the chaos after. But somehow she survived; convinced people to let her rule. Even got her own special flow tattoo to prove it. Casra would be prou–"</p>
<p>"Don't talk about my mother," I said. The blade of the dagger cleaving my breath in two.</p>
<p>"Oh you think I didn't want hae to stay alive? Addict slaves are great. They never fight, they never speak. Sometimes they die but those monstrosities always come back. But… willing slaves? Oh they're even better. They die when you kill them, and they work so hard. All for the glory of their Ulukoma and its great leader Casra. They'd never have known we were selling the fruits of their labor for a premium price."</p>
<p>"Shut up!"</p>
<p>He gripped my arm and stooped down to look closely at me.</p>
<p>"Casra could have made so much money for the two of you. But thi didn't have the willpower. Let's just say I added some fuel to a small fire named Shinna and things kind of spiralled from there."</p>
<p>"Fuck you!"</p>
<p>He looked at me through narrowed eyes.</p>
<p>"You know, it sounds like Casra never taught you any manners. I'll be the man you always wanted me to be today, how about that?"</p>
<p>I was furious, but I wouldn't him know that. Anger only made him happy.</p>
<p>"After you, father."</p></div>

<div class="chapter"><h2 id="chapter30">Chapter 30</h2>
<p>He picked a ziyu far enough way that climbing wouldn't alert anyone, but close enough that moving across the canopy wouldn't be difficult. From his sleeves, he produced two short kelp straps and signalled for me to climb first. I obliged. I went at my usual quick pace up the tree, and upon reaching the canopy, I plotted a path along the thick branches to reach an area above the pavilion. If I moved quickly, I could alert someone about Ramne.</p>
<p>Being in the canopy again gave me a pang of familiarity that I didn't quite understand. I looked to the red stars for some shred of memory. Kipnu's face came to mind: a glimpse of something obscured from my memory. But as Ramne caught up with me, I had no more time to remember. Annu needed me now.</p>
<p>With quick feet, I deftly hopped from branch to branch, careful not to slip on a patch of frost or lose my balance on a shaky branch. When I was nearly above the fire, I peered down, looking for any sign of people. A few paces from the fire I could see three figures, one of them sitting with hands bound and a woman standing over hae: Annu and Setre. There was a woman standing next to Setre with a wide metal shield. She struck some vague familiar chord within my thoughts, though I couldn't place where I knew her from.</p>
<p>Below me, I spotted Laen and Boon, munching on some morsel of food with their legs tied to a tree. I inhaled deeply to yell out to them, but a hand covered my mouth and nose before I could finish. I tried to scream but no air would move under the pressure of his hands.</p>
<p>"Now, now. Don't you go telling on me."</p>
<p>He moved my head to face him.</p>
<p>"This is our little secret."</p>
<p>Ramne rested on a branch immediately next to me and looked below. Near the larger fire was a stack of straw cushions that the injured had used to rest their heads. But nobody remained. Some might have been fishing, but there should have been at least some people building. I felt a strong sense of unease.</p>
<p>"There's no time for this," said Annu, "Ramne is here. He will kill us all!"</p>
<p>Ramne chuckled quietly. "The kaln has some sense," he whispered.</p>
<p>Setre snapped at Annu impatiently, "Shut it!"</p>
<p>"I know it's hard to believe but it must be true! I saw a boat moored here. It was the same one he left the mainland on."</p>
<p>"You sat and watched while he burned this place to the ground. Casra and Kipnu might have survived if you had warned us. But you betrayed your trustworthiness long ago when you banded with him."</p>
<p>The third person intervened. A woman's voice, bold and sweet. Like Rudjani bread. "Setre, what if thi's telling the truth? Ramne could ruin everything we've built."</p>
<p>"This is fearmongering, Fanla. To make us easy targets. Look," she pointed to hae eyes, dimly blue in the darkness. It reminded me that thi was still vulnerable to death. "Thi is an addict. Ginnu was sent here to take all the kanosin Ramne couldn't carry from the fire."</p>
<p>"And what of your kaln? Thi brought hae here safe and sound."</p>
<p>"A token of false trust to bring our guard down."</p>
<p>"Do you hear yourself right now?"</p>
<p>Setre was taken aback. I glanced at Ramne who had a satisfied grin on his face.</p>
<p>"Oh I love this," he whispered with an almost giddy tone. "She doesn't know when to stop."</p>
<p>Setre reached for her spear and Fanla held her arm up.</p>
<p>"Don't," said Fanla. She took a step. "If you hurt hae, you threaten the very trust that binds this place together."</p>
<p>"The wicked deserve punishment."</p>
<p>"And who are you to separate the wicked from the pure?"</p>
<p>Setre shook off Fanla's hand and pulled the spear from her back.</p>
<p>Fanla stood between them and repeated, "Don't do it!"</p>
<p>I looked again at Ramne, who was now looking at me with an eager smile. Before me, he held a polished metal ball in his hand, bisected, with something inside attaching the two together.</p>
<p>"You want to save hae, don't you?" he asked.</p>
<p>I nodded apprehensively.</p>
<p>"Then you you know what you have to do."</p>
<p>He placed the ball into my hand; its weight surprised me. Inside of it was some kind of fluid but I couldn't tell what kind. I had no doubts that such a thing was designed to kill somehow. In his other hand, he brandished the dagger, making sure I knew what would happen to me if I disobeyed. I looked below and saw only silence, hesitation amongst the three. The sound of my own belabored breath hung in my mind as I struggled with the choice I had been given.</p>
<p>She raised the spear and I raised my arm, and as the ball left my fingers I felt a deep pain in my chest. The ball spun through the air, tumbling and falling toward its target; I had to turn away. A metallic sound rang out and a large explosion folded the air on itself and knocked me back, landing me on a flimsy branch that arched under my body weight. I grasped for it to stop myself from falling but my grip wasn't firm enough and I only managed to slow myself down. At the end of the branch I finally caught a small tuft of twig and leaf and swung from it back toward the tree's trunk.</p>
<p>A voice called out toward me, but the blast had caused a ringing in my ears that made everything sound like a hum. I looked up to find Ramne, but he had disappeared from his spot in the tree. I looked below and saw a slow stream of blood running down my body from my chest.</p>
<p>"-inyu?!" I heard my name, followed by more hums of muffled speech. Two voices echoed in my head as I struggled to stay awake and keep a grip on the branch. I felt the branch stutter under my weight, slowly fracturing with the sway of my body. With a loud <em>snap</em> the branch finally broke, upending my sense of direction as I fell for what seemed like several moments compressed and molded to fit into the space of one. A dark figure appeared below me as I was about to land: large and quick. As my body pressed into it, I felt its softness, then its warmth as it moved with me as if to soften the blow. Then as if to rouse me awake, it made a soft humming sound that vibrated through my body.</p>
<p>I heard my name called again by muffled speech, and saw the two figures crowd around me. Deft hands raced across my body, jostling different parts of me left and right, up and down. I felt a finger slide under my coat and catch the wound on my chest. I winced in pain and soon after the fastenings of my coat were undone and a blue light shined above me, showing Setre's face.</p>
<p>"An- Gin-…" hae name turned over in my mind and upon my tongue. Fanla pulled out a flask of water and poured some on the wound. It stung for a moment but then resolved. I opened my eyes to see Setre, Laen, and Boon crowded around me.</p>
<p>"Where is Annu?"</p>
<p>Fanla and Setre paused, puzzled at the question, but Boon raised her head to look in a specific direction and let out two "woop" sounds. A silhouette with soft blue eyes slowly appeared behind Setre, still bound with a rope leading to Setre. Thi was safe for now.</p>
<p>Setre leaned in close and asked me loud enough to hear, "Who did this?"</p>
<p>I responded with the name she least wanted to hear.</p>
<p>"Ramne."</p>
<p>She instinctively turned her head to Annu but I gently pulled her hand to bring her closer.</p>
<p>I said to her sternly, "I'll never forget what you almost did," and sank back down to wait for the ringing in my ears to pass. Fanla took me in her arms and moved me toward the dying fire as Setre stood in the dark, spanning the distance of her unrest, keeping an eye on Annu as thi hesitantly joined Fanla and me.</p>
<p>A crowd slowly began to form, the laborers returning from their work, alarmed at the sound of an explosion. They huddled around Setre, asking questions and fearing for their lives at each answer. Annu sat near Fanla as she massaged my neck to relieve the ringing sound. Thi stared blankly into the darkness.</p>
<p>"You're looking for him," I said to hae. Fanla was startled by the volume of my voice.</p>
<p>"Listening," thi said loudly back to me. "I cannot see."</p>
<p>Fanla chimed in, "Ramne won't be back with this many people. He only strikes when he sees an opportunity."</p>
<p>"How do you know?" I asked.</p>
<p>"All of the ruin you see around you was caused by him. The smoke that slipped you into the great darkness - that was caused by him. Nobody knew how it had started until long after it had ravaged this place."</p>
<p>I told them, "He coerced me because I was alone."</p>
<p>"Then it's best the three of us stick together from now on," she said.</p>
<p>Fanla stopped massaging and shook her hand to loosen it up. I motioned for her to stop when she tried to go back to my neck.</p>
<p>"It's fine. I'm fine," I said, sitting up. She moved her hands to her trousers, dusting off some invisible debris before placing them together on her lap. But before she could settle in, a clamor of people erupted into the camp as blue lights flailed about and small explosions crackled through the trees. The three of us leapt to our feet as the explosions grew closer and closer.</p>
<p>"Holragi!" the guardians yelled. "Holragi!"</p>
<p>Setre flung herself toward the commotion and found some cover behind a big ziyu. She covered the light at her chest and arms with her poncho, and stooped low to stay hidden. I saw Fanla start to follow her but she stopped abruptly, seeing something moving in the distance. Immediately, she turned around and signalled for us to run.</p>
<p>I yelled to Annu, "It's time."</p>
<p>Thi nodded and bellowed to the crowd "To Ulu! Run to Ulu!"</p>
<p>Fanla and I bolted off into the crowd, yelling "To Ulu!" to all who we could find. Some of the Heikoi were packing food into bags, clutching their children close.</p>
<p>"No time!" said Fanla, "Run!"</p>
<p>She motioned for me to follow, but I couldn't. My bond to my nather kept me frozen and planted.</p>
<p>"I'll look after Setre!" she said. "Go!"</p>
<p>The first of the Holragi made it into the clearing, and the guardians who had fled before were now attacking from all sides. Explosions and shouts littered the cold air and I was certain Setre was amidst that cacophony. But I knew that I would be more trouble than help. I knew that it was best not to be by her side. So I turned. And I ran.</p>
<p><em>"Tova'na to re-entry"</em></p>
<p>Far ahead, Annu was running slowly with hae arms held out, tripping on the various traps the forest had set. I sped to hae side and picked hae up on my back.</p>
<p>"It's me" I said, "I'll get you there."</p>
<p>"I can't. I can't do it."</p>
<p>I slowed my walk to listen.</p>
<p>"We can still make it before the Holragi!"</p>
<p>"No, no," thi sobbed deeply into my shoulder. "Everyone… I'm sending them all to die."</p>
<p>I paused my speech to take in her meaning, still running toward the shore. It was something I knew but had never acknowledged. Annu's responsibility encompassed the future of our species. Every one of us would die here. This was an end. The people that inhabit our bodies in a hundred lifetimes may forget about everything they used to be. They would move along the path of time unaware of the memories we used to share, the places we used to dwell, the people we used to love. Or perhaps we <em>would</em> remember, and continue our quarrels until we wiped each other out again.</p>
<p>But this was not question of memory or of self or even of right or wrong. This was a gamble for the future of our species; for our collective knowledge, our ways of life; for any recollection that any of our lives were meaningful. If just one person rose with those memories, then all of our struggles would have been worth it.</p>
<p>We came to a clearing in the darkness where thousands of figures with illuminated hands and feet dotted the beach. The warm sand filled in the crevasses between my toes and a wave of comfort came over me. I lowered Annu to the ground, and wrapped hae in my arms. Hae breathing was heavy and thi was shivering from something far deeper than the cold. I was horrified to see that such an invisible pain.</p>
<p>From the forest came Laen and Boon, sniffing around for me. They saw a shaken Annu on the ground, and nuzzled hae with their wet noses to wake hae up, but still thi couldn't stop.</p>
<p>I did not yell at hae or lose my temper, but I held hae hand as thi held it even tighter, and the tremors began to subside. I sat hae up on a ridge of sand and placed my weight on hae, holding hae closely and speaking into hae ear.</p>
<p>"Annu," I said with a heavy heart, "I know that this is hard. An enormous burden has been placed upon you."</p>
<p>"There is… a feeling," thi stammered, "A terrible feeling. That a deep pit of regret could be lurking around the corner."</p>
<p>I took hae cheek in my hands and spoke as hae eyes struggled to stay open.</p>
<p>"Regret hides behind every corner. But still we turn to carry on."</p>
<p>Thi slowed hae crying and looked squarely into my eyes. Hae face was full of fear.</p>
<p>"Melna entrusted her spirit to you. And now I do the same. Wholly. Firmly. If you've lost faith in yourself, then borrow our faith in you."</p>
<p>A broken smile showed just for a moment, calming the storm of shivers that crackled through hae body,</p>
<p>"Help us, Annu."</p>
<p>Thi stared at me with those same gentle eyes; hae soul was crushed but hae spirit, boundless. It was in that moment that I felt the sacred permeate, that most precious of ethers that binds us all to each other. My mind unlocked the future, and a flood of a thousand souls flowed out from the sea and into the spaces between us. I felt a presence in Annu that could only be understood as a reflection of myself.</p>
<p>"I knew there was something special about you," thi said, "Melna lives on inside you."</p>
<p>Hae hand traced my cheek until it held my neck gently in its calloused ridges.</p>
<p>"Gather up the bluekelp. A half handful for each."</p>
<p>I spared no pause to repeat hae words, and neither did anyone who heard. Straight away, the kelpers and the fishers jumped into the water to find sharp rocks and harvest. The others stayed behind to find large flat rocks to build a sort of shallow vessel in the ground. They made quick work of each task: a pile of short kelp squares appeared in mere moments. Annu had found some strength to stand, and asked Fanla guide hae way to me.</p>
<p>"Say a few words, and then I'll tell them," thi said, and I nodded to hae in agreement.</p>
<p>I gathered those around me and mustered up enough mental fortitude to speak to them. But I knew how precious our time was, and I began before I was ready.</p>
<p>"As you know, the Holragi have cornered us into this beach and we're out of options. I had hoped we could have some time to discuss this, but this is our last and only option. What we're asking you to do today will take incredible courage and indominitable will from each and every one of you."</p>
<p>I took a moment to see each one of them for who they were, that they would be remembered if only for a moment. It was the children that brought the hint of tears. Some barely a na'tova younger than myself. Many without parents. For every ray of illumination that landed upon them, a bead of water, a furrowed brow, a subtle tremble. They wore their fear like a uniform. They looked to me as their captain.</p>
<p>"Each of you will get a small square of kelp. Chew it, swallow the liquid, and spit out the rest. Then…"</p>
<p>Thi took a deep sigh, looking to the crowd.</p>
<p>"…We swim… Far far away… Where Holrag can never find us."</p>
<p>They seemed confused by this cryptic answer.</p>
<p>"Where do we go?" asked a boy, nearly my age.</p>
<p>"Toward Ulu."</p>
<p>"There's nothing but ice out there," he said.</p>
<p>There was no response from hae, but a steady gaze toward the darkness. I glanced and saw tears in the shallows of hae eyes, and knew that thi couldn't say it. Nothing of truth or fallacy would satisfy a life that longs to continue but can't.</p>
<p>I spoke for hae, "We will live on the ice. The Holragi would never dare go further than this point."</p>
<p>Annu couldn't look me in the eye, but gave my chest a nod of approval and gratitude.</p>
<p>"Let's begin," I called. "Form two lines and move quickly!"</p>
<p>The crowd did not form two lines, and instead nearly trampled each other, but Fanla saw this coming and kept the weaker and smaller ones protected. I grabbed a few squares each for Laen and Boon and held tightly to a corner as they chewed away on the rest. As I went back to the pile to get one for myself, a familiar hand caught my eye as it reached out toward the pile.</p>
<p>"I'll be right back," I said to Annu.</p>
<p>"Wait, where-," thi objected, but I was gone before thi could stop me.</p>
<p>I found Fanla maintaining a line near the crowd.</p>
<p>"Keep an eye on me," I asked her.</p>
<p>The crowd was densely packed, full of people bobbing left and right to see the rest of the line. But I knew who I was looking for. I reached the end then doubled back on the other side of the lines, certain that I would find him, but his face did not appear. Then I heard Annu scream, and a raucous of confused voices. Fanla and I rushed toward the noise from different sides. No one had stopped their rush for bluekelp save for a Heikoan girl who waved at us to approach.</p>
<p>"A man took Annu into the forest," she said. Fanla took off into the forest, but the girl asked me, "what's he gonna do?"</p>
<p>"Don't worry, we'll track them down," I said. "Just make sure to get your kelp."</p>
<p>She held out her square proudly, and I smiled before sending her off and running into the forest after Fanla.</p>
<p>The sound of metal clanging on metal rang in the chilly air, mingled with the smell of sparks. I caught up to Fanla who was staring into the darkness toward the clamor.</p>
<p>She held me back. "It's too dangerous. Wait until they stop."</p>
<p>As my eyes began to adjust, I could see their figures in the light of Fanla's outstretched hands. A jingling sound accompanied Annu's dodging and weaving through Ramne's attacks. As I looked closer, I saw that thi held Melna's binding pendant taut in front of hae as a sort of weapon. We waited for an opening, a distance just long enough for us to hold Ramne back and disarm him, but every time Annu would create distance between them Ramne would close it in an instant.</p>
<p>"You can't stop this, Annu!" yelled Ramne, "The Holragi have control!"</p>
<p>He wailed on hae but thi dodged every blow and jab he tried. In a fake motion, Ramne thrusted his dagger in a stabbing motion toward hae belly, then twisted in the direction of hae dodge and struck the front of hae shoulder, nearly landing his blow on hae neck. Annu growled between hae teeth in pain and stepped away from Ramne a few paces, but thi did not let hae guard down. I wanted to run and help hae, but Fanla saw Ramne approaching again and held me back. He tried the same movement again, twisting in the direction of hae dodge, but this time Annu predicted his movements and dodged his second swing.</p>
<p>"You're an undertake, Ginnu. A fool. You're sending these people to their deaths!"</p>
<p>A third time, he lunged at hae, and this time thi dodged underneath his free hand, slipping behind him in his most vulnerable stance. Thi caught his neck in the strand of the pendant and held him back, while Fanla rushed in to prevent a counterattack. Ramne writhed with his dagger and landed a blow on Annu's belly, to which thi cried in pain and forced him onto the ground. Fanla deftly pinned his arm down and wrested the dagger free.</p>
<p>Thi stopped to his ear, and spoke to him in a fevered voice, "Remember this as you breathe your last. My name is Annu. You sent me to my death countless times, only because you knew you could do it again. The pain… the suffering you caused can never be erased. Death is now every part of me. It becomes me. And nothing makes me happier than returning this gift to you."</p>
<p>Thi moved hae knee onto his head and pushed his face firmly into the frozen dirt.</p>
<p>And it was done.</p>
<p>In the distance, the sound of explosions and yells grew closer.</p>
<p>"The guardians are being pushed back," said Fanla.</p>
<p><em>Setre.</em></p>
<p>Annu stood up from Ramne's lifeless body and watched the motion in the trees grow closer. Thi took up Ramne's dagger, laughed with that same fervored voice, and readied haeself as if to go into battle.</p>
<p>"Run!" yelled Fanla.</p>
<p>I swiftly ran to Ramne's body and fetched the pendant, wanting to help hae fight. But Fanla pulled hard on my arm to wrest me from that idea. I screamed and pried at her arms, but Fanla would not stop until we had reached the shore.</p>
<p><em>Nather.</em></p>
<p>The darkness swallowed the percussion of an advancing Holragi army as we came back into the clearing. Everyone had a faint blue glow underneath their skin, and seemed in somewhat of a euphoric state.</p>
<p>"Into the water, everyone! The Holragi are on their way!"</p>
<p>The crowd waded into the water, kicking up a large blue froth that spanned the coast for as far as we could see. I checked on Laen and Boon, made sure the skin under their fur was turning blue. They were fighting sleep, but refused to go without me. Overhead, a dim streak of light formed in the sky and a rumbling noise came over my listener.</p>
<p><em>"If anyone can hear me, I'm landing Lao 2-ka Ulu Ulukoma. Lao 2-ka. Ulu. Ulukoma. I need assistance."</em></p>
<p>"Come on!" yelled Fanla, impatiently.</p>
<p>I looked around for anything that floated, but this shore had none – only trees and sand. A single tear formed in the corner of my eye as I knew that I'd run out of time. I took my listener off, and buried it snugly in the sand. Thi made a beautiful red arc in the sky, and I regretted that this imaginary friend of mine couldn't see the light of truth thi had made for all of us. I whispered to hae through the air my last goodbye.</p>
<p>"Liffa…"</p>
<p>"I'm… sorry."</p>
<p>Fanla took two kelp squares from her pocket, and gave one to me. We swallowed the bitterness and spat out the rest, and felt that life-bringing death come upon us. As we waded into the water, all of the turmoil that pervaded our minds melted away, and left us with nothing but clarity. We stood within our minds, together in an infinite space. We knew our purpose, for time knew it for us.</p>
<p>My mother's voice came to me like the voice of a ziyu, and I lay my head upon her lap.</p></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<div class="chapter"><h1 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h1>
<p>It was hot again. And my body was shaken with fear.</p>
<p>"This is Liffa um Heiko. If anyone can hear me, I'm landing Lao 2-ka Ulu Ulukoma. Lao 2-ka. Ulu Ulukoma. I need assistance."</p>
<p>There was no response.</p>
<p>"This is Liffa um Heiko. If-"</p>
<p>I yelled, "Dammit!" letting all of my frustration fall onto the instrument panel before me. The fire out the window was bright orange-yellow, and the vehicle shook violently. My back hadn't felt a squeezing like this since launch, and I struggled with my entire body to stay in position. Surely I would hurt myself if I slipped now.</p>
<p>"It's too late. Ditch the antenna," I said to myself.</p>
<p>I saw my hand lift one small lever and close another, and a metal rod unlatched itself from the capsule.</p>
<p>"Just survive, Liffa. One problem at a time."</p>
<p>I remembered the protocol from the first two slowdown burns. The red lever for red flames. Yellow lever when you see yellow. I had done those already. Maintain rotation with the silver knob. I had been so focused on getting contact that I didn't notice the capsule had begun to spin. I twisted the knob one way, and the capsule started rotating more. A nudge the other way, and it slowed. Gradually, the rotation stabilized as I read the dial above me, but my head still felt like it was spinning and spots invade my vision.</p>
<p>The flames fizzled out, and the squeezing feeling relaxed. I regained my thoughts an looked outside. It was dark everywhere save for the lanterns of cities. Only the thinnest glint of Ara peered through the obscura and threw their shadows onto the land.</p>
<p>"First chutes. 'Pink like the sky,' they said. Assholes…"</p>
<p>I pulled the knob and heard the pressurized air send the chutes out, then braced for their strong heave just before they fully unraveled and began to slow my descent.</p>
<p>I had a moment to look out the porthole again and saw the thousand lantern lights of Rudjan below me. I wondered at them. If they had seen me making a mess of their sky. If they knew who I was, or if they just assumed I was another weapon of Holrag raining down upon Ulukoma. I figured that I was lucky they spared me such a mission.</p>
<p>"Second chutes at one lao'ka. 'Black like the ocean'."</p>
<p>I braced again and felt the tug of the chutes slow me down. Above me, I saw my airspeed dial begin to fall and rest at a low speed, and felt happy to at least know that I could feel the ocean beneath me before I passed.</p>
<p>I held my anticipation for the splashdown, "Any moment now…"</p>
<p>But instead, I felt a hard, jarring <em>thud</em>. The capsule had stopped.</p>
<p><em>What?</em></p>
<p>I listened to the silence, and heard wind for the first time in what felt like a lifetime. A tear of bittersweet joy came to my eye as I sat in my seat, tightly nestled by the invisible tug of Palinan, my home. I wouldn't dare open the door until my mind had settled from this terrible ordeal.</p>
<p><em>Footsteps. Someone is here!</em></p>
<p>I unbuckled myself from the seat, and tried to raise myself out of it, but everything suddenly went sideways.</p>
<p><em>What the fuck is happening to me?</em></p>
<p>"Aye. Liffa?" called an unfamiliiar maman voice through the capsule walls.</p>
<p><em>Who the…</em></p>
<p>"Yes?" I screamed to be heard. "I'm Liffa. Who are you?"</p>
<p>"Nevermind that, we've come to get you."</p>
<p>"Oh?!"</p>
<p>I heard some small thuds of something hitting the ground. And some muffled laughter.</p>
<p><em>Where did I land?</em></p>
<p>"Is something funny?" I asked.</p>
<p>"You'd think it were," said the voice, as it came right up against my metal house. There was some rapping and tugging against the door I had come in on, but it wouldn't budge.</p>
<p>"Little help?" thi said.</p>
<p>"Uh… sure," I said. I mustered up the strength to lift myself, slowly this time, and twist the latch of the door open. It made a loud <em>kachunk</em> as the seal was broken and fresh cool air filled my lungs. I did not know relief until I took such a breath.</p>
<p>The maman and a few others lifted me out and carefully wrapped me in three giant coats before laying me down. I looked around and realized that we were surrounded by ice. The ocean had frozen solid in the time I was gone.</p>
<p>The maman held a waterbag and a lantern to me, and I took a drink eagerly. Thi had broad shoulders and wore ruddy black kelp clothing all over hae body as if thi had found it and cut it haeself. The others all had lanterns to light their faces. They all looked to be from different places, but their clothes were the same.</p>
<p>"What a strange ship," thi said, staring at the charred remains of my three-day home. "No wonder you crashed. There's no rudder - couldn't steer."</p>
<p>I smiled for the first time in a long time, and looked deeply into the maman's eyes.</p>
<p>"Thank you… um?"</p>
<p>Thi said hae name with a smile.</p>
<p>"Shinna."</p></div></body></html>
