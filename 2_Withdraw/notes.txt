ch5 greiving day

ch7 diaries and emails
ch8 rena finds that many at work and at the meeting are convinced that the soldier thing makes their loved ones heros.
ch9 rena visits michelle again, michelle refuses, rena is given a letter to give to david.
ch10 diaries and emails. David never responds. Allude to this.
