Chapter 20

The plane was ironically, Chinese-made. Bound in aluminum, the cheap ones of us crawled into the economy section and made ourselves as comfortable as we could for the long trip to Narita. I hadn't been back for about a year, but I never felt homesick. I had found what I thought would be a home in San Francisco, and though it had all but vanished, I still held onto its idea, recalled it every once in a while. 
I watched the Pacific peel away as we ascended into the firmament and I realized that it seemed weaker as it sharnk.  The water I was now staring down at was not the same water I had been looking across each day. The one I was used to made a point to remind me how big it was, its role as a divider. But this Pacific was small. Its waves were the threads in my sheets, forming a pattern that would eventually end just as I'd seen it begin. And it gave me hope.
We passed through the ceiling, meeting turbulence on the way, and were now in the sky's dominion. There isn't a word for the bliss I found on that cauliflower beach 30 thousand feet in the air. When I was a kid, my parents told me that planes were buses to heaven, and that we'd been chosen to be gods for a day. And even now, I still felt like a goddess when I was floating above the ground in my kingdom of clouds. But the sun, Amaterasu. She was always above me, my eternal goddess. The one whose existence was so important that it took all the heavens to cajole her out of hiding (#IdontHaveTheFactsToBackThisUp). When I wanted her around, I usually knew where to find her. She was the one to anchor me whenever my life was running away. And though I could only see her reflection in the wing now, she was still the same warm assurance that I would have a friend with me whenever I looked up.
