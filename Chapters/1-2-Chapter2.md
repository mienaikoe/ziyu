## Chapter 2

After Kipnu left for work, I descended down to the cellar to dress for the long day of sowing. The smell of damp on the stone walls pervaded the air and opened my nostrils in reminiscence. My mother was with me.

I hooked a bulb to the overhead electrical rails, and little by little the flow of electricity grew and warmed the metal ribbon inside to a bright white. Every morning was a repeat of the same movements I had learned from countless mornings of dressing with my mother, but instead of being boring repetitive task they had evolved into a calming daily ritual. Hanging from a length of twine were a pair of canvas trousers, a thickly-woven tunic, and gloves stained with clay and chlorophyll. No matter how often I dirtied them or dinged them up, they withstood it all. I was certain that my family knew how to make more durable clothes than anyone in Heiko.

We used to grow Pohua, a hardy root vegetable known for its sweet and fruity taste. She would carry me in a big thatch bag on her back while she tilled, planted, harvested. I watched her hands unfold those tiny tubers across the clay and pack them in. At days end, I would gaze in awe of how much she could plant and harvest and aspire to do the same. It's been 6 seasons since she passed, but she lives as vividly in my memories as she did in life.

"I bet you'll plant 1000 today, Liffa"

"2000!"

"Hohoho. 2000 then."

My childhood attention span would always get the best of me before I could get close. I undid the lights and power rail and took a last breath of the earthen basement air. The day was calling.

---

"Another day, then," called Tiggu. She had caught me unawares from her plot of land next to mine. The same farmer's trousers adorned her, but she was apparently more strict about washing them daily.

"Is your life really so mundane that the days are all the same?" I asked jokingly.

"Oh, I enjoy the repetition. Can't get a body like this by talking to tie-backs all day."

She was referring to the tied-back robes of the members of the court where Melna worked. I ignored her and shifted my focus to my work.

"It's chilly today, isn't it?"

"I suppose so. Every season will have a few of these."

"Yes, but it’s too early, isn’t it?”

"Oh you'll get them at all times of the season. Once when I was young we had 4 days of frost right after germination. Lost the whole plot and had to start over."

"That sounds unfortunate, but I think this one is different. It's the middle of our warm season"

"It's just a cold spell. These things happen. It'll be back to normal soon, you'll see."

"Sure. We'll see."

Her answer was unsatisfying, but I went back to working. Perhaps I was overreacting.

"So when are you three going to have children? It's been several seasons since you were joined"

"That's none of your business"

"I'm just looking out for you. When you can't dig anymore, you'll wish you had someone to take your place."

"I'll be just fine"

"Though, I wonder how you'll raise kids and crops at the same time. Takes a different sort of mother."

"Like I said, I'll be fine." The things she said were nothing new, though they always bothered me more than they ought to have. We worked side-by-side in silence for a few clicks, and then she began again.

"How are Melna and Kipnu doing? Any new stories for an old lady?"

"They are fine."

"That's all? Just fine?"

I snapped, "What do want, woman?"

"Mind yourself, Liffa. What sort of Maman raises hae voice to an elder?"

"They're doing just fine, okay? Kipnu is having a great start at the clinic, and Melna is representing this village to the council. Is that what you're looking for?"

She sughed, went quiet, and resumed her work while I stared at her indignantly.

"A jealous Maman never rests," she said out of nowhere.

I jabbed my shovel into the clay and stopped myself from yelling something I would regret later. _That's enough for now_.

---

My sense of humility or perhaps a feeling of unimportance surfaced as I entered a house that I could never have called home on my own. I don't blame Tiggu for her perspective. She was born of the same caste my parents came from; taught to accept their roles in life as farmers or parents. If they tried to better themselves and ascend from their lot, they would be met with endless criticism from their family for burdening everyone with their risks. I like to imagine that Tiggu tried to branch out once, but would never admit it to a lowly farming Maman who joined with a higher class and has no interest in raising children.

I took my boots and trousers off so as not to make a mess, and left them outside next to the door where the clay from countless planting days had painted a spot on the mossy pathway. I took a seat at the table next to the window to sit near an aromatic plant I had been cultivating for its calming effects. In a sigh, I took in everything around me as if it were all some dream that I would one day abruptly wake from.

_Do I deserve to be here? I am not saving lives or building for the future like Kipnu or Melna. But I still contribute to the village and I make sure we have food and water and a functional home._

_"A jealous Maman never rests"_

_Tiggu... What did Mamen ever do to offend you?_

_Or was I the rude one? No, She was intentionally trying to get under my skin._

_I feel guilty. Why do I feel guilty? What sort of corruption has this old bat woven into my heart?_. It felt dirty, like I needed to burn away some part of who I had become. Or reclaim the self-dependent Kaln I used to be. I drifted back to childhood, my father used to telling us that "Nothing is promised". My naether would always remind him, "You promised to love us".

There was a knock at the door to snap me awake. _Is it that Tiggu again come to tell me I was rude?_ I sat up and quietly snuck toward the door to see who it was. _Jesse? Delivering a message now? What could he possibly want?_

I cracked the door with my trousers still beside it and he started as soon as the door opened.

“Liffa, I have an urgent message for Melna. Is she here?”

“Um. No she left a few clicks ago.”

He was still catching his breath, “We - we need to find a way to get it to her as soon as possible.”

“Slow down for me. What’s this about?”

“It's about Ara.“
