## Chapter 2

Working in the field never felt lonely to me, though I knew some who resented it for that reason. My thoughts may betray me sometimes, but never out there. There was far too much to be done to have thoughts of other places and other times.

Every morning was a repeat of the same movements I had learned from countless mornings of dressing with my mother. I would descend to the cellar to dress for the long day of sowing or harvesting or maintenance. The smell of damp on the stone walls pervaded the air and reminded me that my mother was with me. Above my head were electrical rails where an old lightglass that I moved along them wherever I needed to see. Its metal ribbon was slow to warm, but with time it could make a room as bright and as warm as Ara. At the far side of the room were my clothes drying on a length of twine: trousers and a tunic made of thickly-woven vinegrass, and two gloves stained with a lifetime of clay and chlorophyll. No matter how often I dirtied them or dinged them up, they withstood it all. I was certain that my mother knew how to make the most durable clothes of anyone in Heiko.

We used to grow pohua, a hardy root vegetable known for its sweet and fruity taste. As a toddler, my mother would carry me in a big thatch bag on her back while thi tilled, planted, harvested. I watched hae hands unfold those tiny tubers across the clay and pack them in. At days end, I would gaze in awe of how much thi could plant and harvest. More than a thousand days had flowed through me since thi passed, but thi still lived vividly in my memories.

"I bet you'll plant one-thousand today, Liffa," thi said once.

"two-thousand!"

"Hohoho," thi laughed in the most graceful way. "two-thousand then."

My childhood attention span was not helpful, but thi was never disappointed in me as long as I was learning.

I lifted the light from the rails, set it in its corner, and took a last breath of the earthen basement air. The day was calling.

"Another day, then," called Tiggu as I walked the length of a plot of clay. She surprised me from behind the wide fence thi insisted on building.

"Is your life really so mundane that the days are all the same?" I asked jokingly.

"Oh, I enjoy the repetition. Can't get a body like this by talking to tie-backs all day."

"The fidelants play an important role in our society. Melna included."

"Ah. What good is a railroad and electricity? Doesn't help me harvest."

I changed the subject, "It's chilly today, isn't it?"

She stopped for a moment to think.

"I suppose so," she said. "Every rotation will have a few of these."

"Yes, but... Isn't it too early?”

"Oh you'll get them at all sorts of times. Once when I was young we had 4 days of frost right after germination of one plot. Lost the whole thing and had to start over. Ara is a fickle thing."

"That sounds unfortunate, but I think this one is different somehow. The wind is strange too, isn't it?"

"It's just a cold spell. These things happen. It'll be back to normal soon, you'll see."

"Sure. We'll see."

Her answer was unsatisfying, but I went back to working. Perhaps I was overreacting.

"So when are you three going to have children? It's been a while since you were joined."

"That's none of your business."

"I'm just looking out for you is all. When your legs grow weak and you can't bend down to harvest, you'll wish you had someone to take your place."

"I'll be just fine."

"Though, I wonder how you'll raise kids and crops at the same time. Takes a different sort of mother. A nather like me would harvest a whole plot in the morning and birth a kid in the evening."

_I doubt that._

"Like I said, I'll be fine."

The things she said were nothing new, though they always bothered me more than they ought to have. We worked side-by-side in silence for a bit, and then she began again.

"How are Melna and Kipnu doing anyway? Any new stories for an old lady?"

"They are fine."

"That's all? Just fine?"

I snapped, "What do you want from me, woman?"

"Mind yourself, Liffa. What sort of maman raises hae voice to an elder?"

I was at the edge of my frustration.

"They're doing just fine, okay? Kipnu is having a great start at the clinic, and Melna is representing this village to the council. Is that what you're looking for?"

She sighed, went quiet, and resumed her work while I stared at her indignantly.

"A jealous maman never rests," she said out of nowhere.

I jabbed my shovel into the clay and stopped myself from yelling something I would regret later.

_That's enough for now_.

---

There was a sense of humility or perhaps a feeling of unimportance as I returned home. I didn't blame Tiggu for her perspective. She was born of the same caste my parents came from; taught to accept their roles in life as farmers or parents. If they tried to do something else with their life, they would be met with endless criticism from their family for burdening everyone with their risks. I like to imagine that Tiggu tried to branch out once, but would never admit it. Perhaps she was making sure that I wouldn't make her mistakes.

I took my boots and trousers off and left them next to the door, where the clay from countless planting days had painted a spot on the mossy pathway, and fled immediately to the dew column at the center of our home. My scent glands picked up the aroma of the anomin plants I had been cultivating in my room. They led me in, as if expecting me to return. With a sigh, I took it all in as if seeing it for the first time: my small cup collection, the hang drying pohua, my mother's dusty old lanterns, and the anomin filling the air with its resins and oils. But still I was unsettled. As with all things in my life, it felt temporary. Like some fantastic dream that I would one day be awoken from, abruptly and without warning.

_Do I deserve to be here? I'm not saving lives or making big decisions._

_But I still contribute pohua to the village. I make sure we have food and water and a functional home._

_"A jealous maman never rests"_

_Tiggu... What did Mamen ever do to offend you?_

_Or was I the rude one? No, She was intentionally trying to get under my skin._

_I feel guilty. Why do I feel guilty? What sort of corruption has this old woman woven into my heart?_.

It felt unclean, like I needed to burn away some piece of myself that had spoiled, to protect my homeland from myself.

_No, I am self-dependent. That is who I am. That is what makes me worthy of living._

I laid down on my bed and let my thoughts drift back to childhood. My father used to tell me, "Nothing is promised in life. Even your mind can betray you". And my nather would always remind him, "You promised to love us".

There was a knock at the front door to snap me awake. _Is it that Tiggu again come to tell me I was rude?_

I sat up on my bed and quietly snuck toward the door to see who it was.

_Jathi? Delivering a message now? What could he possibly want?_

I cracked the door to talk to him, but before I could say anything he unleashed a flurry of desperate words.

“Liffa, I have an urgent message for Melna. Is she here?”

“Um. No she left a bit ago.”

He was still catching his breath, “We - we need to find a way to get it to her as soon as possible.”

“Slow down, Jathi. What’s this about?”

“It's about Ara.“
