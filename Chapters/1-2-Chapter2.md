## Chapter 2

Working the soil of my family's land never felt lonely to me, though I knew some who resented it for that reason. My mind used to betray me with false hopes and fears, but those voices were silenced among the rows and rows of pohua that were under my care. They demanded all of my focus, and I gave it to them gladly.

I dressed myself each morning the same way. Stepping down into the cellar with the smell of damp on the stone walls pervading the air, I was reminded that my mother was with me. Above my head were electrical rails where an old lightglass was perched. Its metal ribbon was slow to warm, but with time it could make a room as bright and as warm as Ara. At the far side of the room were my clothes drying on a length of twine from yesterday's washing: trousers and a tunic made of thickly-woven vinegrass, and two kelpen gloves stained with a lifetime of clay and chlorophyll. No matter how often I dirtied or dinged them up, they withstood it all such that I was certain that my mother had made the most durable clothes in the world.

My family grew pohua, a hardy root vegetable known for its sweet and fruity taste. As a toddler, my mother would carry me in a big thatch bag on her back while thi tilled and planted and harvested. I watched hae hands unfold those tiny tubers across the clay and pack them in. At days end I would gaze in awe of how much thi could plant and harvest. More than a thousand days had passed since thi was gone, but thi still lived vividly in my memories.

"I bet you'll plant one-thousand today," thi told me once.

"two-thousand!" I replied.

"Hohoho," thi laughed in the most graceful way. "two-thousand then."

My childhood attention span did not help me reach my lofty goal, but thi was never disappointed in me as long as I was learning.

I opened the cellar door and watched the lightglass ribbon grow orange and then black with the turn of a switch. With one last breath of earthen air, I focused my mind on the field before me and ascended to greet the daylight.

"Another day, then," called Tiggu as I walked the length of my field. She surprised me from behind the wide fence thi insisted on building between our crops.

"Is life so mundane to you?" I asked jokingly.

"Oh, I enjoy the repetition," she said. "Can't get a body like this by talking to the robes in Shaki all day."

"The fidelants play an important role in our society. They may not work with their hands, but they make great strides with their minds and voices."

"Bah. Nonsense," she said. "What good is a railroad and electricity? Doesn't help me harvest, just makes Holragi all the richer."

I paused to consider her point but I knew that nothing would get done in that spiral of thoughts so I quickly changed the subject. "It's chilly today, isn't it?" I asked pointedly.

She stopped for a moment to think. "I suppose so," she said. "Every rotation will have a few of these."

"Yes, but... Isn't it too early?”

"Oh you'll get them at all sorts of times. Once when I was young we had four days of lingering dew right after germination of one plot. Every plant in there took twice as long to grow. Ara is a fickle thing."

"That does sound difficult... but I can't help but think this one is different. The wind is strange too, isn't it?"

"It's just a cold spell. Thing will slow down, but they'll be back to normal before long. You'll see."

"Sure," I said. "We'll see."

Her answer did nothing to satisfy my suspicion, but I'd begun to think I could be overreacting. Maybe it was a cold spell, like Tiggu said. My mother had told me about the same cold spell, how it made the pohua roots swell with sugar.

Tiggu interjected, "So when are you three going to have children? It's been a while since you were joined."

"That's none of your business," I said, being as polite as I could.

"I'm just looking out for you, Liffa. When your legs grow weak and you can't bend down to harvest, you'll wish you had someone to take your place."

"I'll be just fine."

"Though, I wonder how you'll raise kids and tend to your field at the same time. Takes a different sort of mother. I used to start the harvest in the morning, give birth at midday, then head back out to finish the job. If my bundmaman were in my position, thi'd have gotten nothing done."

"Like I said, I'll be fine."

<!-- left off -->

I desparately wanted to change the subject. The things she said were nothing new, though they always bothered me more than they ought to have. We worked side-by-side in silence for a bit, and then she began again.

"How are Melna and Kipnu doing anyway? Any new stories for an old lady?"

"They are fine."

"That's all? Just fine?"

I snapped, "What do you want from me, woman?"

"Mind yourself, Liffa. What sort of maman raises hae voice to an elder?"

I was at the edge of my frustration.

"They're doing just fine, okay? Kipnu is having a great start at the clinic, and Melna is representing this village to the council. Is that what you're looking for?"

She sighed, went quiet, and resumed her work while I stared at her indignantly.

"A jealous maman never rests," she said out of nowhere.

I jabbed my shovel into the clay and stopped myself from yelling something I would regret later.

_That's enough for now_.

---

There was a sense of humility or perhaps a feeling of unimportance as I returned home. I didn't blame Tiggu for her perspective. She was born of the same caste my parents came from; taught to accept their roles in life as farmers or parents. If they tried to do something else with their life, they would be met with endless criticism from their family for burdening everyone with their risks. I like to imagine that Tiggu tried to branch out once, but would never admit it. Perhaps she was making sure that I wouldn't make her mistakes.

I took my boots and trousers off and left them next to the door, where the clay from countless planting days had painted a spot on the mossy pathway, and fled immediately to the dew column at the center of our home. My scent glands picked up the aroma of the anomin plants I had been cultivating in my room. They led me in, as if expecting me to return. With a sigh, I took it all in as if seeing it for the first time: my small cup collection, the hang drying pohua, my mother's dusty old lanterns, and the anomin filling the air with its resins and oils. But still I was unsettled. As with all things in my life, it felt temporary. Like some fantastic dream that I would one day be awoken from, abruptly and without warning.

_Do I deserve to be here? I'm not saving lives or making big decisions._

_But I still contribute pohua to the village. I make sure we have food and water and a functional home._

_"A jealous maman never rests"_

_Tiggu... What did Mamen ever do to offend you?_

_Or was I the rude one? No, She was intentionally trying to get under my skin._

_I feel guilty. Why do I feel guilty? What sort of corruption has this old woman woven into my heart?_.

It felt unclean, like I needed to burn away some piece of myself that had spoiled, to protect my homeland from myself.

_No, I am self-dependent. That is who I am. That is what makes me worthy of living._

I laid down on my bed and let my thoughts drift back to childhood. My father used to tell me, "Nothing is promised in life. Even your mind can betray you". And my nather would always remind him, "You promised to love us".

There was a knock at the front door to snap me awake. _Is it that Tiggu again come to tell me I was rude?_

I sat up on my bed and quietly snuck toward the door to see who it was.

_Jathi? Delivering a message now? What could he possibly want?_

I cracked the door to talk to him, but before I could say anything he unleashed a flurry of desperate words.

“Liffa, I have an urgent message for Melna. Is she here?”

“Um. No she left a bit ago.”

He was still catching his breath, “We - we need to find a way to get it to her as soon as possible.”

“Slow down, Jathi. What’s this about?”

“It's about Ara.“
