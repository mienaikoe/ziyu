## Chapter 2

Working the soil of my family's land never felt lonely to me, though I knew some who resented it for that reason. My mind used to betray me with false hopes and fears, but those voices were silenced among the rows of vegetation that were under my care. They demanded all of my focus, and I gave it to them gladly.

I dressed myself each morning the same way. Stepping down into the cellar with the smell of damp on the stone walls pervading the air, I was reminded that my mother was with me. Above my head were electrical rails where an old lightglass was perched. Its metal ribbon was slow to warm, but with time it could make a room as bright and as warm as Ara. At the far side of the room were my clothes drying on a length of twine from yesterday's washing: trousers and a tunic made of thickly-woven vinegrass, and two kelpen gloves stained with a lifetime of clay and chlorophyll. No matter how often I dirtied or dinged them up, they withstood it all such that I was certain that my mother had made the most durable clothes in the world.

My family mainly grew pohua, a hardy root vegetable known for its sweet and fruity taste. As a toddler, my mother would carry me in a big thatch bag on her back while thi tilled and planted and harvested. I watched hae hands unfold those tiny tubers across the clay and pack them in. At days end I would gaze in awe of how much thi could plant and harvest. More than a thousand days had passed since thi was gone, but thi still lived vividly in my memories.

"I bet you'll plant one-thousand today," thi told me once.

"two-thousand!" I replied.

Thi laughed at my eagerness in the most graceful of ways and said, "Two! Two-thousand! My my."

My attention span was much shorter than my optimism, but my mother was never disappointed in me as long as I was learning. I still miss hae every day.

I opened the cellar door and watched the lightglass ribbon grow orange and then black with the turn of a switch. With one last breath of earthen air, I focused my mind on the field before me and ascended to greet the daylight.

"Another day, then," called Tiggu as I walked the length of my field. She surprised me from behind the hedgerow she insisted on planting between our crops.

"Is life so mundane to you?" I asked jokingly.

"Oh, I enjoy the repetition," she said. "Can't get a body like this by talking to the robes in Shaki all day."

"The fidelants may not work with their hands, but they make great strides with their minds and voices."

"Bah. Nonsense," she said. "What good is a railroad and electricity? Doesn't feed anyone, just makes Holrag all the richer."

I paused to consider her point but I knew that nothing would get done in that spiral of thoughts so I quickly changed the subject. "It's chilly today, isn't it?" I asked pointedly.

She stopped for a moment to think. "I suppose so," she said. "Every rotation will have a few of these."

"Yes, but... Isn't it too early?"

"Oh you'll get them at all sorts of times," she said. "Once when I was young we had four days of lingering dew right after germination. Every plant in there took twice as long to grow. Ara is a fickle thing." Tiggu was never at a loss of irrelevant stories.

"I can't help but think this one is different," I said. "The wind is strange too, isn't it?"

"It's just a short cold spell. Things will slow down, but they'll be back to normal before long. You'll see."

"Sure," I said. "We'll see."

Her answer did nothing to satisfy my suspicion, but I'd begun to think I could be overreacting. Maybe it was a cold spell, like Tiggu said. My mother had told me about the same cold spell, how it made the pohua roots swell with sugar.

Tiggu interjected, "So when are you going to get some children on your bosom? It's been a while since you were joined."

"That's none of your business," I said, being as polite as I could.

"I'm just looking out for you, Liffa. When your legs grow weak and you can't bend down to harvest, you'll wish you had someone to take your place."

"I'll be just fine."

"Though, I wonder how you'll raise kids and tend to your field at the same time. Takes a different sort of mother. I used to start the harvest in the morning, give birth at midday, then head back out to finish the job. If Lanna were in my position, thi'd have gotten nothing done."

"Like I said, I'll be fine."

I had a speech pattern where I would repeat myself until my disinterest was heard. It was passive-agressive, I know, but sometimes it was all a maman could do to be polite. It's not that I didn't like her company – I was no stranger to her unfiltered blather – but those subtle jabs always found a way nestle in my head and ruin my thoughts.

We worked side-by-side in silence for a bit, but then she began again, "How are Melna and Kipnu doing anyway? Any new stories for an old lady?"

"They're fine."

"That's all? Just fine?"

I snapped, "What do you want from me, woman?"

She feigned a look of offense. "Mind yourself, Liffa. What sort of maman raises hae voice to an elder?"

"They're doing just fine, okay?" I was at the edge of my frustration, and it was showing. "Kipnu is starting his new clinic, and Melna is still working hard at the senate. It's nothing you don't already know."

She sighed, went quiet, and resumed her work while I stared at her with wide eyes, looking for some kind of acknowledgement that she'd gone too far with her questions. But then she murmured, "A jealous maman never rests," projecting just enough for me to hear.

All at once, I jabbed my shovel into the clay and exerting the full strength of my willpower to stop myself from yelling something regrettable.

_That's enough for now_.

I quenched my frustration on the slow walk home, trying my best not to blame Tiggu for her perspective. She was born of the same caste that my parents came from; taught to accept their roles in life as farmers or parents or face endless criticism for burdening everyone with their risks. I liked to imagine that Tiggu tried to do something else with her life, just as I had, but I knew she would never admit it. Perhaps she was making sure that I wouldn't make her mistakes.

The clay from countless planting days had painted a spot on the mossy pathway, and I left my boots and trousers there to quickly get inside. As I entered, I was greeted by the piny aroma of anomin plants I had been cultivating near the large oval window. They had opened up to take in the morning light before closing for the rest of the day, as most desert plants did. My finger touched upon a glossy petal and turned into that of my father's when he gave them to me. "Anomin represents a time I remember long ago," he said wistfully, "when light was grown from light, not conjured from metal."

But now, my little desert garden simply fell into the backdrop of a noble Heikoi home. I took it all in as if seeing it for the first time: Melna's fancy cup collection, my father's dusty old lanterns, and the anomin filling the air with its resin. It was all so rich with life in a place like this. But as with all things in my life, it felt temporary. Like some fantastic dream that I would one day be awoken from, abruptly and without warning.

_Do I deserve all of this? My life is not that important._

_No... I make sure we have food and water and a functional home. Melna and Kipnu couldn't possibly last without me._

_"A jealous maman never rests"_

_Tiggu... What happened for you to be this way?_

I felt guilty, unclean, like I needed to burn away some corruption that the old woman had woven into my hearts. But I knew that corruption was made long ago by a world that didn't know any better. I had to remind myself that life is what makes me worthy of living. No one could take that worth away. My father used to tell me, "Nothing is promised in life. Even your own mind can betray you". And my nather would always remind him, "You promised to love us."

There was a knock at the door. _Is it that Tiggu again come to tell me I was rude?_

I quietly snuck toward the door and opened it a crack, careful not to show my bare lower-half. _Jathi? What could he possibly want?_ But before I could say anything he unleashed a flurry of words.

"Liffa, so glad to see you," he said, catching his breath. "Is she here?"

"Melna? No she left a bit ago. What's wrong?"

"I have an urgent message. I need to get it to her as soon as possible."

"Slow down, Jathi. What’s this about?"

"It's about Ara," he said with a tinge of despair.

"Ara? Why would Melna need to know about Ara?"

"Thimlu and I have been studying something..." he said hesitantly, "She asked us to keep her in the loop."

_I knew it!_

He began to turn back toward the road, "Well, if she's not here, I should go back to call–"

"Wait!" I stopped him. "Let me go with you."

"Oh that's really not necessary-"

I hollered to him, "I need to know more; I won't slow you down," while I ran to fetch a new pair of trousers as quickly as I could. The pohua would have to wait for another day.
