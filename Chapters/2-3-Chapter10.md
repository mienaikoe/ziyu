## Chapter 10

Kipnu's feet ambled through the forest at a near jogging pace, following the path that his eyes tried to trace through the overwhelming darkness of the dense forest. The kanosin had no trace left in his eyes, but the blue line at his chest was the only things keeping him from running into a rogue branch or a raised root.

"Two thousand paces," he repeated out loud. "Can't be much father."

He looked upward at the leaves and branches dancing along the deep purple sky above him as he listened to the breeze, hoping to hear some hint of a fallen tree or the soft footsteps of his mysterious savior. But only the cold wind spoke to him. He held tighter to the black poncho that Setre had given him, shuddered at the memory of her body against his. Though he knew what had happened to him was real, it felt like a dream, as if his mind had distanced itself from reality to keep moving on with life.

He came across a tree with a coil set into its trunk, just like the ones he'd seen when Setre was taking him in. _I must be near wherever I'm supposed to go. What are these coils for?_ He took a closer look at the sap-covered copper spiral, imagined the years of experience it must have taken to make something metallic look so perfectly organized. _Probably some old maman and hae trinkets_, he thought to himself.

Amidst the quiet observation he sighed and felt the exhaustion he'd gathered that morning catching up to him. So he rested himself below the coil and gazed into the darkness from where he had fled.

"Damn this cold," he whispered to himself. He curled up into himself, his body shivering from exposure, but it was only a temporary relief. _I wonder if Setre is searching for me_. His thoughts meandered to the memories of her face, closed and sinking into his shoulder. The feeling of panic and confusion and euphoria. _Did I want it to happen?_ he asked. _Did I enjoy it?_ A knot grew in his stomach.

"Liffa, Melna," he spoke to the wind as if they were listening. "I've broken our oath." A tear began to fall down his cheek. The first he'd had time to shed. "Melna, you have to understand..." he gasped for an explanation but he knew he had none. Who would believe him? Who could possibly understand what's happened here? He thought of Liffa, wondered if thi was being treated well or if Fajro really was using hae life to bargain with the senate. Maybe Melna was doing better. She always remained composed while the rest of the world was teetering at the edge of madness.

Kipnu heard quick footsteps approaching behind him, and he quickly stood up and covered his brightly-lit body.

"Kipnu?" a maman called his name. He was expecting Setre or the faceless maman who congratulated him, but with one word he could tell that this person was different. There was a distinct tone to hae voice: warm and earnest and full, and not so saccharine as many were. Thi passed by him, looking around, but didn't notice him standing a few paces away. He looked on as thi circled around the area and placed hae hands on a tree that grew diagonally from the ground. Hae hands came to hae chest and clutched an object in hae coat. Thi fiddled with it and gradually a small bright flame grew from a glass enclosure: a lantern of sorts. In the warm light he could see a fractured trunk and the many branches that suspended it above the ground.

He hesitated, but he knew he should say something. "I'm armed," he bluffed, walking slowly away from the tree. He maintained the distance between them. "Don't come any closer," he said.

"Kipnu, you've made it!" thi said. "Come in, come in. We have much to talk..."

But thi looked back at him as he stared back with eyes colder than the wind. "Who are you?" he asked. "Is this another of Shinna's tests?"

The maman adjusted hae stance, took a step toward him and bowed. "I am Casra and this is my home. We did not lead you here to test your loyalty or enslave you with kanosin. We brought you here so that you could be yourself again, and hopefully help others to do the same. I know you have no reason to trust a stranger from what you've seen out here, but you can see yourself that I live far away from the others for a reason. I have a place of refuge here. Safety from the hunters and the cold."

He observed: hae spartan coat and trousers, a well-used lantern, and no sign of kanosin in hae skin. Casra might not be with Shinna but he'd learned to measure everyone on Ulukoma with an eye of distrust. "How many are here?" he asked.

"It's just my kaln and I," thi said.

"You brought a child to this place?" he asked. Before Casra could reply, a patch of ground beneath the fallen tree began to open up, and a kaln climbed out. Kipnu recognized hae face in the lantern light. "You're that kaln from the ship!" he exclaimed. "Linyu, was it? The woman, Setre. She knew your name."

Linyu walked toward Casra and grinned at him as thi stared at his chest. "You're blue now," thi said with a clever smirk. "Linyu!", Casra admonished hae but Kipnu chuckled along with Linyu. His eyes met again with Casra's and a sense of warmth came over him. He was in good company here.

The entrance Linyu had popped out of was a wooden door with just enough space to fit Kipnu's lumbering body. As he set foot upon the floor of their home, he took in the sweet piny scent of burning anomin oil. To his left was a small black iron firebox with a pot sitting atop. To his right, a small low table crouched over a thickly-woven kelpen rug, the same material as the long black poncho draped over his shoulders. At the far end of the room a large vinegrass bed was neatly laid in a corner where Linyu was lighting a third lantern perched upon a metal stand. Casra had already prepared him a set of thick kelpen trousers and foot wrappings and held them out with a stern look on hae face as if to insist he wear them before stepping any further.

"Lin," thi said. "grab a few paocha leaves from the cupboard."

The kaln rose to fulfill hae mother's request and chimed at Kipnu, "I didn't mean to call you blue. I think blue looks good on you."

Casra took a satchel from the kaln and pulled out two small dried leaves with hae finger. "Here, rub some of this on your tongue and then wash it down with some water. It will taste bitter for a bit, but it keeps your body warm and the cravings at bay."

He hesitated, not wanting to fall prey to another strange substance, but he trusted that Casra had good intentions. He placed a leaf upon his tongue and immediately winced at the bitter tannic flavor. "It's doing its work," Casra reassured him. The bitterness went away after a moment, leaving behind a pleasantly sweet flavor and a warm current in his blood. Casra took out another small leaf and broke it in half for haeself and Linyu.

"I hear you're a physician from Heiko," said Casra.

Kipnu's hearts skipped a beat. "How could you possibly know that?" he asked. "You weren't at the fire. I would have noticed someone following me."

"You're very perceptive, Kipnu," thi said. "I didn't mean to startle you. I'm afraid I can't answer your question until I know that I can trust you."

He looked suspiciously into hae eyes, trying to see beyond the veil of hospitality, but he saw no signs of deceipt. "Yes," he said hesitantly. "I'm sorry for my outburst. Being honest about my trade has only given me trouble out here."

"I understand that very well," Casra laughed and looked past his feet to another time thi held in hae mind. "You aren't the only physician in Ulukoma."

"You too? But why? I mean, I'm here for personal reasons. I'm just passing through, you know? But you... you've made a home on this island."

Linyu handed Kipnu a wooden bowl: a clarified soup of fish, fermented seaweed, and Heikoi grain. He'd forgotten how hungry he was and eagerly took the bowl into his own hands, thanking Linyu graciously for the gift.

Casra took a deep breath. "I was a physician once - one of the best in Rudjan. I would often see kanosin addicts that had come directly from Ulukoma looking to escape their addiction and I even developed my own treatment protocol for withdrawal. It was a combination of psychotherapy and sedatives that worked very well. In a stupidly brazen move, I decided to test it on myself to prove to my peers how effective it was, but I vastly underestimated the potency of kanosin and I was unable to pull out of its grasp."

"You became dependent," said Kipnu. "Just like anyone else on kanosin."

"Yes," thi continued. "I'd failed to realize that the most important part of my therapy was me. I couldn't guide myself toward anything while my body was guiding me back to kanosin. The magistrates of Rudjan had me sent here to save their reputation. I used to be the one they turned to when they had to sentence an addict. 'Rehabilitation not Retribution'. That is what I sold to them, and they took that to the people of Rudjan. But all of that was away by my own ignorance."

"Casra," he said and thi looked up into his eyes. "I can't possibly know your pain. But anyone that's half as ambitious as you are can surely recover from anything."

Casra gazed at him, as if transfixed by his words or perhaps his eyes. "Oh, I'm sorry," thi said, averting hae eyes as if awakened from a daydream. "I shouldn't be yammering about my problems to a stranger.-"

"-No. Please," he interrupted. "I want to know more. About this place. About you. Tell me what you know and I'll tell you about myself." Thi looked at him with pensive eyes; one half trusting, and the other half unwaveringly cautious. He appealed to the trusting half, "Do you remember what they teach us about grieving patients?"

"The rock and the beacon?" Casra asked. Thi balked at his suggestion, "Am I to think of myself as your patient?"

"Would you humor me?" he asked. "You can learn a lot about someone knowing their guiding forces." He glanced at Linyu who was staring back at him with keen attention. There was a sort of gravity he had with hae, as if every word he said carried a story within it.

Casra sighed and paused to think, and then thi began. "Ulukoma used to be a place where trust was normal. The evening was a time of storytelling, singing, confessing of love or desire. Anyone could stand up and say or do anything they wanted. We explored the depths of our minds and bodies together, no matter how difficult or shameful. It was a time of discovery, weaving our lives together and apart and together again, growing closer and wiser with each new breath of understanding."

Thi smiled and started again, "I remember being so afraid on my first night here. We were thrown off the ship just as you were, and I just remember being so confused as I struggled blindly in the water to find my way to safety. Then I heard a voice. 'This way,' she said, and I followed her without a question. She helped me and the others onto the shore where the rest of Ulukoma had gathered to meet us, and she told me her name was Setre."

"Hold on," said Kipnu. "Setre? The Setre that nearly killed me in the forest two days ago? She's the one who saved your life?"

Casra nodded. "I know this is hard to believe, but Setre was my rock through everything. There were many days when I felt the feverish hand of death upon me while I was going through withdrawal, but she watched over me, gave me the comfort I needed in the painful times and the tough love I needed through the cravings. At some point we fell in love, though I don't think I could tell you when. It's a lot like an addiction: You wake up one day and realize that you're already in it."

"Love?" said Kipnu. "Are you certain we're talking about the same person?"

"Setre is a complicated person. You don't know her like I do."

"Few people are as complicated as they say, I've come to find," he said. "I rarely misjudge a person's character."

Casra scoffed. "Are all physicians in Heiko so arrogant?"

"The Setre you used to know is nothing like the Setre I saw back there." He pulled down the side of his trousers enough for Casra to see the bandage he'd placed on his thigh. "She sliced through my skin like it wasn't even there."

Casra looked digusted at the sight but calmed haeself. "Setre plays an important role under this new leadership. A role that she is very good at playing. But that isn't who she wants to be."

"Ask the people she's enslaved if that matters to them. She calls herself a hunter. And her 'prey' are ordinary people that never asked for any of this. Addicts, like you used to be."

"You wouldn't be here, safe with me, if it wasn't for her," said Casra. "The commotion that covered your escape was no accident. Setre and her band of spies had to make sure you were in the right place at the right time."

"Spies?" he wondered aloud. "You mean to say that Shinna's own right hand is fighting against hae?"

"Shinna and Setre have their own plans. Sometimes they are at odds with each other, and other times they are in agreement. But they both have the same goal."

"To fulfill their own selfish desires," he said mockingly.

Casra did not look amused. "There are many layers to every person, Kipnu, just as there are many layers to this island. Setre sent you to me because she knows you have an unwavering spirit and a curious mind. But all of that is wasted if you choose to remain ignorant."

"I am ignorant of many things, but this is not one of them. I know what I saw. Half of everyone here is a slave to the other half. There is no complicated system of layers that can justify that. Setre and Shinna have built a colony from the labor of kanosin addicts. There is nothing else that could possibly justify what they've done."

Casra formed a wistful wrinkle on hae brow. "Nothing in Ulukoma holds a shred of justice, but it would be naïve of you to think that either of them want Ulukoma to be this way. They are not inherently evil as people. They are the emergents of an evil system that they are trying to fight against."

"Casra, respectfully, you're hanging on to an idea of who they used to be. I don't blame you: it's easier to remember your friends at their best."

"You know nothing about what they mean to me!" thi snapped at him and hae skin turned flush with frustration.

Kipnu rebuked hae, "Right and wrong has to mean something if our lives are to make any sense."

"And you would know the difference after two days here?" thi asked pointedly. Linyu grasped Casra's hand and settled hae. "You think you're superior to everyone here – that you don't belong here. Everyone does. But we all came to this island as criminals under the laws of our people. Laws that can paint us however they want. Tell me, was it wrong for you to be punished for defending your bundmaman? Or was it right to send a dangerously violent man to a place where he posed no threat to anyone else? Does your life make any sense now that right and wrong has been decided for you?" thi paused to take a deep breath and wipe the moisture from hae cheek. "Shinna and Setre didn't choose to build things this way. They came to this conclusion by watching me fail to keep this place together. As our numbers grew, smugglers began showing up on our shores, promised things that I could never provide. Then Shinna brought antikan and used it to gain power over the addicted. I don't think that thi knew the smugglers were running everything until thi had already become the new leader of Ulukoma. But they were so entrenched by then that nothing could have stopped them."

"That's ridiculous. This whole island hangs on hae every word. Thi could have all the smugglers thrown into the ocean if thi wanted."

"We would all starve to death if that ever happened," said Casra, and a sobering realization came to Kipnu that he had been every bit as ignorant as Casra said he'd been.

He paused looked back at Casra with a look of regret, but his heart did not soften. "I believe you," he said, "And you probably have a plan for me, but my unwavering spirit has only one goal right now: to get away from this place and stop my bundmaman from being sent to hae death. If you were looking for someone to do your bidding or whatever, then I'm not your guy. I will be off this island as soon as I can find a boat."

"Fine," Casra said sharply as thi stood up and snatched the bowl from his hands. The trudging of hae footsteps toward the water basin were cold against the tension that had filled the room. "You want a boat, we'll find you one tomorrow."

Kipnu sat with his warm belly and Casra's words and weighed his trust for hae. Linyu sat quietly at the table, fiddling with some trinket made of wood and metal. He imagined having to raise a child on his own with only the help of that bruteish woman. Perhaps there was a side to her that he couldn't see.

"You will freeze to death if you take a canoe," Casra continued with a wet bowl in hae hands. "Long before you make it to shore. You could try to ride with a smuggler but they're likely to sell you to the highest bidder."

"What about the ship I came in on?" he said. "Couldn't I sneak onboard without them knowing?"

Casra looked at him with eyes of conviction. "You either love your bundmaman very much or not at all, throwing your life away so carelessly," thi said. "What sort of trouble did thi get caught up in that thi couldn't even be sent here?"

He understood Casra to be quite perceptive but hadn't prepared for what he would do when the topic of Liffa would inevitably come up. "It's a long story," he said.

"Kipnu, we have plenty of time," said Casra.

"There was this guy," he started, "who wanted to send hae to space."

Casra laughed until thi noticed that Kipnu wasn't. "Oh. You're not joking about that, are you?"

Kipnu felt a sense of longing for Liffa and Melna, and he wondered when he would see them again. "He's the reason I was sent here. I let him know how I felt about it."

"An educated man like you doesn't get sent here for nothing," said Casra. "You throw one punch in your life, maybe two. And you mean it."

Kipnu was surprised that thi could read him so well, but he imagined that such a skill was useful in a place where kanosin is worth more than a life.

"Tell me about hae," thi said. "Thi sounds like an interesting maman to say the least."

"Liffa was... is... everything good in my life," he said. "To the rest of Heiko Liffa is just a farmer, but they don't see hae like I do. Thi holds Melna and I together, and thi does it well, but there's this cloud that hangs above hae always. Sometimes I just can't figure hae out."

"And your bundwoman?"

"Melna is...," and he paused to find a word - any word. "She's a fidelant"

Casra gave him a puzzled look. "Why is this the first word you choose to describe her?"

"It's all she does lately. Half of her time is spent in Shaki. The other half is spent visiting people and getting their opinions, so I don't see her as often."

"Do you trust her?"

"Of course!" he softly exclaimed. "We're bonded."

"Tell me something, Kipnu. Where are they right now?" Kipnu was blindsided by hae question. "They are far from you," thi said. "Has something happened?"

"I fought for Liffa to stay, and I was sent here."

"And Melna?"

He started mincing his words. "There are bigger things at stake for her."

"Do you trust them to go on without you?"

"Go on," he said, agitated. "You want to say something, say it."

"The people who come here leave behind lives full of relationships. Some of them invent new worries to keep themselves attached to the people they left behind. They inevitably die trying to leave this place, never knowing that they'd been so easily replaced by someone else. The thoughts they were building were self-destructive. They placed their faith in the lives they knew, rather than the lives they were living. By deciding not to come here, Melna has decided to continue her own life on its own trajectory – and all the better that she doesn't suffer for it. So what I'm asking is this." Thi leaned forward to look closely into his eyes. "Do you trust your bunds to do what's best for themselves, even if it means leaving you behind?"

He frowned at hae, exhaled a short impassioned breath. "When you're bonded," he said. "You always do what's best for your bonds even if it means betting your life on it."

"Whatever it is that has you worried for your maman's life, there's nothing you can do about it when a vast stretch of ocean stands between you and hae. Both of them need you to stay alive for as long as possible. And you have to trust that they will do the same."

"I can't just leave them," he said solemnly. He walked toward the ladder he'd come in on and looked up at the wooden cap that kept the cold out. "Liffa is in grave danger. I have to go find hae at any cost."

He looked back at Casra with conviction in his eyes. Perhaps thi knew more about his own mind than he did in that moment, but he wouldn't be swayed. "I need to sit and think for a while," he said. "I'll be right outside."

"I'll go with you," said Linyu as thi grabbed the wooden puck thi was fiddling with and followed him to the ladder.

"I won't follow you," said Casra to Kipnu. "But be vigilant. Wouldn't want a hunter to come whisk you away when I wasn't looking. Look after 'em Lin." Thi shot a glance toward Linyu who smirked in response: some sort of language only meant for each other's ears. He blushed for just a tick, recalling his mother's scowls and hums that only he could understand. He wished they hadn't died with hae.

"Follow me," said Linyu, squeezing between Kipnu and the ladder with ease. With one quick swoop, thi was up the ladder and lifting haeself up to the ground. Kipnu carefully placed his feet and hands upon the well-worn wooden rungs, trying least of all to be as agile as a kaln half his age. He glanced back at Casra before he ascended, and for a moment he wished that he could stay with them in Ulukoma.

The cold air bit his cheeks as he emerged from the ground, but Linyu didn't seem bothered. Thi was sitting on the fallen tree, observing with hae hands all the wires and beads intricately woven onto the wooden thing that thi had been working with, and Kipnu's curiosity had reached a peak.

"Linyu," he asked. "What are you working on?"

"A listener," thi replied without looking up.

Kipnu paused, waiting for some kind of explanation. "Um... what is a listener?" he asked.

Thi paused, thinking, and then stood up and said, "Come with me."

"Linyu-"

"I have to show you something. It'll be quick," thi said.

They arrived at the trunk of a modestly sized tree with a coil of copper affixed to it - the same ones Kipnu had seen when he first arrived at the island. Linyu began brushing debris from the tree and held out the "listener" for Kipnu to take off of hae hands. He carefully took the puck from its wooden edges and observed the intricate details that were affixed to it. It was very much like the coil on the tree, but the copper wire was thinner and more tightly wound, with a small black bead affixed to one end. In the center of the coiled wire was a larger black bead, suspended by six strands of thin wire held taut by winding around six wooden pegs at the edge of the puck.

"This is my newest one," thi said. "Please don't break it." He nodded in confirmation, not sure if he knew how not to break it.

"My nather gave me a listener that she took from Holrag once. She told me that they talk through coils like this on every tree in Holrag."

"They can talk?" asked Kipnu. "To the trees?"

"Not to the trees. _Through_ them."

"I don't understand," he said. "But continue."

"My nather wanted me to figure out how it works by making one. I spent days trying different sizes of wire and attaching different things to the ends of it. And then the bead began to vibrate ever so slightly. It was a voice that said '3...0...9'. That's when I knew."

Kipnu was skeptical. "So the Holragi can talk through the trees. How does it work? The roots?"

"No," said Linyu. "The air!"

He balked at the idea. "That's not possible. The air is nothing like a wire."

Linyu lifted the wooden instrument to his ear and said, "Listen."

"I don't hear anything," he said.

"Listen closer."

He focused his mind and listened closer to the faint static that entered his ear. A pulsing, rhythmic pattern began to emerge, like the waves of the ocean. But upon them was the sound of a man's voice, in a narrow tone like nothing he had ever heard before. The words were unintelligible, but he knew from the tone and the rhythm that the voice was speaking Holragi. He looked around for a Holragi man hiding in the shadows. "Who does this voice belong to?" he asked Linyu, and hae face lit up with excitement. Kipnu stared again the piece of wood in his hands, trying to find any trace of a trick, but there was none.

"Those voices come from a place far away," thi explained. "From someone standing at a tree just like this one." Hae hand found the coil embedded in the wooden trunk of the fallen tree, and with hae other hand thi pushing the listener back toward Kipnu's ear. "But if the speaker is near you..." Thi turned toward the tree and whispered into it, "it will sound like they're standing right next to you."

Like a figment of Kipnu's own mind, hae whispers pierced the ocean of noise with their clarity. They echoed and reverberated off of walls he couldn't see, and landed in his ear through this tiny configuration of wood and metal. "How?" he asked. "I don't understand."

"My mother calls it magnetic air. It fills the universe; the dark and the light; the clay beneath, and the sky above. The trees speak to each other – the wind speaks, as we say – but we need a wire and a magnet if we want to listen in. And once your voice is on the magnetic air, everyone with a listener can hear you."

"Magnetic air," he repeated in a troubled tone. "I wonder how the Holragi kept it a secret for so long." He thought to himself about the mystery of Linyu: the resolve in hae voice when thi led a confused mass of people stranded in the dark ocean to safety, and how that determination evaporated when he saw Setre's face. "Your nather must have had as much bravery as she had cunning to escape Holrag with one of their toys," he said.

"She stole it before she left," thi said. "It kept the loneliness away. Wandering across the world looking for a home can be taxing. It still smells like the bitter smoke that covered her hands every day making steel."

"Escaping as a slave must be-"

"-Steelmaker," thi interrupted. "She was more than a slave."

He swallowed his words, knowing he hadn't been careful with that sharpened word. "I meant no offense," he said. "Steelmaker."

After a moment's pause, he spoke again, "Have you heard any mention of my bundmaman, Liffa, in that listener of yours? You know... from far away?"

"Messages from Holrag are usually too faint to hear, and the messages are cryptic and technical. But I have made out a few of them that are announcements. Usually they're about the Ara line."

"The Ara line! Yes! What have you heard lately?"

"They haven't spoken much lately. They must be building something big," thi said. "Is that where your Liffa is? The Ara line?"

It pained him to pause and think about it, but he gathered himself and replied, "Yes. They want hae to be the first to..." A sigh took to his lungs and forced him to pause.

"The first to Ara?!" Linyu's eyes lit up. "Thi must be so smart."

He stuttered, "Y-Yes, but-"

"I wonder what it smells like in space. Do you get to talk to hae? I want to talk to hae too!"

"No. I don't get to talk to hae. They took hae as punishment for breaking the law."

"Punishment?" Linyu was confused. Kipnu wondered if he should mention the obscura, wondered if there ever would be a right time. Linyu had grown up fast – this much was apparent – but hae eyes were still full of dreams, potent and fragile; the type of dreams that die big over and over.

"It's a lot to talk about right now. I need to do some thinking of my own before I can tell it. I promise that you'll learn all about Liffa some other time. Just keep your ear to that listener and listen for hae name. Promise?"

Linyu looked back at him, unsatisfied. "Why don't you listen for hae yourself?" Hae arm moved quickly in the darkness and landed on Kipnu's ear. He instinctively moved away but stopped himself when he realized Linyu had a listener in hae hand. With a few clumsy movements of hae hands, Linyu finally attached the device to his ear. "Got it. Now you don't need me to hear them anymore."

Kipnu listened intently to the sound in the listener, hoping to hear hae voice, but he heard only static. He couldn't keep this gift, as much as he wanted to. "Linyu... I really want to keept this, but I have to leave soon. You worked really hard to make this. You should give it to your nather."

"She already has one," said Linyu. "That's how she found you."

Kipnu was confused for a moment. "How she what?"

"Maybe you'll be gone soon," said Linyu. "But I want you to have it. Maybe someday you'll hear my voice and remember us."

He fumbled for some response, then acknowledged that he had been rash to dismiss hae offer. "Of course," he said. "Thank you for this. I'll keep listening for you."

Linyu smiled.

Casra's voice called out behind them. "A little breeze told me you were still here, Kipnu. You should come get some rest before you leave. You'll need whatever strength you can muster if you're really going to try to paddle back to the mainland."

His usual urgency was clouded by a deep lethargy that set into his limbs and eyehaw. He wondered if the kanosin had done something to him.

"Our bed is not available, however," said Casra. "We'll find you something else."

"The floor is good," he said, simply wanting to rest.

Once hae feet hit the floor of their home, Linyu fetched a pillow and blanket and placed them on the floor next to the bed. Kipnu graciously settled into the corner that Linyu had set for him and removed his foot wrappings, feeling his bare feet hit the dry clay ground – oddly warm for such a cold place. He listened as Casra's voice mulled over the walls in a soft hum, painted them with a melody that spoke as if music itself was a language; like a poem that Linyu had heard countless times before, that Kipnu didn't need to.

<!--
Casra looked at him admiringly, as if to wonder how such a good heart could be sent to such a miserable place. But thi remembered that all people have a dark side, including herself. -->

<!-- "Smuggling is a lucrative trade. If you have a big enough buyer, then you can make anything happen."

"Who would need kanosin that much?"

"That's what I intend to find out." -->

<!-- left off -->

<!-- kanosin as ulukoma's export -->
<!--
"Kanosin is the only thing we can trade with the smugglers for food or tools but we used to share what we earned equally amongst ourselves."

"You were a kanosin refiner?" Kipnu flipped his tone. "Did you forget the oath we swore as physicians? 'Ability over Apathy'?"

"I didn't forget it!" thi snapped at him. "I've spent my life for the benefit of others!"

"How can you say that and still make the most addictive drug this world has ever seen?"

Casra looked at him with a fire that told him he'd gone too far. "We don't have Ara to do our work for us here," thi said. "There is no steam to cook with, no steel to build with. Kanosin is all we have to trade for some semblance of civility." Hae face was flush with stress and thi looked away to calm haeself down. "Things have been different ever since Shinna and Ramne arrived. What you saw back there is not how it used to be. They came to this island with a neutralizer for kanosin and instead of using it for good they used to gain power and influence. They bastardized all of our traditions, divided us into haves and have-nots. I couldn't stay any more" -->

"And then Shinna arrived. Many who fought so hard to break their addiction were seduced by the concept of antikan as a way to 'cheat' on their sobriety, but they never saw a drop. Others just wanted to feel superior over everyone else. Shinna made many empty promises and built an empire on the backs of their labor. Setre never gave up fighting for me and our tribe, grew impatient with my insistence on a peaceful resolution. She was right, of course, and at the end of it she forced me to leave to keep Linyu safe. I promised Setre I would return one day when Linyu was old enough, and I made her swear to me that she would keep the council alive. That day was yesterday. But when Linyu told me thi saw her in the forest, holding you down and taking you away, I knew it was over."

"Why did you come back?" asked Kipnu. "Why would you risk the life of you and your child to be in a place like this?"

"I'm not a child!" said Linyu, getting up from hae chair. Casra took hae hand to calm hae. -->
