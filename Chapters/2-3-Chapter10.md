## Chapter 10

A hand fell upon Kipnu's back and stayed there - intentional, not accidental. He removed his hands from his ears and listened to the chaos around him. He turned toward the hand.

"Hold still," a voice called from behind the hand. He could almost place the maman it came from. Thi grasped his arm firmly and pricked him with a needle. It jerked away as a reflex, and the maman let it go.

"Trust me," thi said, and he steadied his hand for hae. Thi had the hand of a doctor, adept and confident, and the injection flowed smoothly into his veins. Gradually, his headache subsided and his eyesight returned, and he saw the maman clearly. Thi had the same kelp clothing as the others and a mask around hae mouth made of thin woven vines.

Thi stood up and looked at the crowd so as not to rouse suspicion.

"Stay low and walk ahead of me," thi said and held hae hand out slightly for him to take it. He had no reason to trust this maman but was desperate for a way out, so he took hae hand and walked slowly and quietly out from the crowd. When they got well enough away, the maman bent down to him and whispered, "Keep running toward Ulu and stop under the fallen tree. Run!", pushing Kipnu out of the pavilion. He looked back for a second and saw nothing but a closed flap of black cloth. Naked and hungry, he made a break for some fallen tree he had never seen before in the darkest part of the island.

_I've escaped! But surely they'll be after me soon._

The forest was darker here, but he found that somehow he could see better than yesterday. Perhaps it was the light of the blue marking from the injection, or his eyes adjusting to an eternal nighttime. It was still quite difficult to look for fallen trees in such a dense forest. He made a point to listen more intently for places where a breeze would whistle across the bark. Maybe a fallen tree would likely sound a bit different, he thought.

He came across another tree with a coil set into its trunk. This time, the coil was polished and covered in sap, presumably from the tree it was attached do. _That veiled maman must have put these around. Who is thi?_ He wanted to stop to observe, but he forced himself to continue onward. Only a few steps, and he quickly found himself facing a giant obstacle. He followed it left and right, and made out the shape of a giant fallen tree thrusting its behemoth roots toward the sky, and he knew he'd come to his destination. Against the roots, he rested himself and gazed into the darkness from where he had fled.

"Damn this cold," He whispered to himself. He curled up into himself, his body shivering from exposure, but it was only temporary relief. He tried retracing the events of last night in his head. He remembered Setre injecting something into him, and a feeling of panicked euphoria. A knot grew in his stomach. _All my dreams... Did I want it? No, what am I saying..._ 

A different kind of headache had set in, and he pushed on his eyes to ease the pain. Liffa came into his imagination - strapped into a train without rails, flying beyond the edge of the sky. He wondered if thi was being treated well, if Fajro really was using hae life to bargain with the senate. Maybe Melna was doing better. She always remained cool and composed when the rest of the world teetered above a cliff of mindless panic. He loved that about her. 

_Would they understand? Would they accept what I've done?_

_Maybe I do belong here..._

Behind him, Kipnu heard quiet and quick footsteps approaching. He quickly got up to his feet and ducked behind a tree, waiting for the footsteps to approach before he decided his next move.

"Kipnu," the maman quietly called him. 

He could faintly see the silhouette of the one who had helped him. It was that same familiar voice of the veiled figure, but the veil had been removed and he recognized who it was.

"Casra?" He whispered to hae.

Kipnu was immeasurably relieved to see a familiar face, even if only an acquaintance.

"Kipnu, you've made it!" thi said. "Come now, under the fallen tree."

They walked no more than fifty paces before coming to the base of a massive tree with another copper coil on it. Casra cleared some leaves from the base and opened a wooden door that had just enough space to fit one person at a time, beckoning for Kipnu to follow hae down into the warmly-lit space below. He looked around and saw a home. A sort of cooking area to the left, a large bed at the far end, and a hand-made table in the center where Linyu was lighting a third lantern. He squatted down in reflex to cover himself, but Casra had already prepared him a set of kelp cloths and stood at the entrance helping him get into them. He found them quite warm â€“ warmer than he suspected.

"Lin, grab some paosin from the cupboard."

The kaln rose to fulfill hae mother's request and chimed, "Hi Kipnu. Thank you for saving me."

"Hey there..." he said as nicely as he could in the circumstances. 

A wave of pain began to swell up again and he clutched his forehead and closed his eyes. Casra took a satchel from the kaln and dipped hae finger in it. "Here, rub some of this on your tongue. You'll feel some stinging at first, but it will subside."

He did as she told and immediately winced at a stinging sensation covering his tongue.

"It's doing its work," thi reassured him. Out of the corner of his eye, Kipnu could see Lin eying the shiny pendant around his neck. The stinging went away after a minute, along with the recurrence of his headache.

"The pain... it's gone. What is paosin?" he asked.

"Back at the pavilion, I gave you antikan to neutralize the kanosin in your blood. Paosin helps the symptoms of withdraw," Casra responded.

"I see," he said. The substances were familiar to him but he had never had the experience of taking them.

"I believe I have a great deal to explain to you. This is my kaln, Linyu. We arrived here with you yesterday, but we used to live here many ma'to before."

Linyu handed Kipnu a wooden bowl of some sort of fish stew, and he eagerly took it with gratitude and started eating.

In between spoonfuls, he asked, "Why have you come back to a place like this?"

"I spent three ma'to here at a dark time of my life. My journey began like most Ulukomai - a slave and a kanosin addict. The stuff was produced here by slave labor and then smugglers would bring it to the mainland. It's a vicious cycle that I got caught up in. Before I was an addict, I was a doctor - one of the best in Rudjan. I would often see kanosin addicts that had come directly from Ulukoma looking to escape their addiction and I developed my own treatment protocol that worked very well. In a stupidly brazen move, I decided to test it on myself to prove to my peers how effective it was, but I vastly underestimated its power and I was unable to pull out of it."

"You were the cause of your own suffering."

"Yes. My junds left me and I was sent here as punishment. This place used to be equitable. The clear-minded still held the power here, but they would try to uplift the addicted. Shinna changed all that, bastardized all of the traditions that kept this place livable for the addicted."

"I noticed... a class hierarchy back at the pavilion."

"Shinna was a chemist in Shaki who somehow stumbled upon an antidote for Kanosin. Then thi came here with hae stockpile of antikan, and instead of giving it to us, thi used it as leverage to gain power over me. Now the upper class use it to get high at night and by morning they're back to normal."

"Wait, gain power over you? So you were a leader here?"

"Yes. One of three that formed a council of sorts. I was pushing for Ulukoma to become an independent province when I was ousted."

"How did you go from an addict to the leader of Ulukoma?"

"That's a long story," thi smiled and looked into hae mind, thinking of a better time.

"I like long stories," he said. "They get me invested."

Thi laughed, and paused to prepare haeself.

"I guess I'll start where I left off. You remember I mentioned traditions. One of the traditions we used to have was the evening. It used to be a time of storytelling, singing, confessing of love, public mediation. Anyone could stand up and say or do anything they wanted. Then some would group up and explore their sexualities together before sleep, and others would just sleep if they weren't ready. The evening was a place and time where people weaved their lives together and apart and together again, and everyone grew closer to each other because of it. I had been under the addiction, but I had the faculty to understand their words and feel the love of a tribe more deeply than I knew of my junds."

"On my first evening at Ulukoma, I had just met Setre, and she introduced me to the group, told them only the good things that I had told her about myself, and it was then that I knew: Ulukoma was not the lawless prison they said it was. About a ma'to after I arrived, Setre was pregnant and was convinced that I was the mother. At first I couldn't believe what she said, because I thought that kanosin led to impotence. But when I saw Linyu, felt hae eyes peer into mine, I felt... it. I felt motherhood. There it was right in front of me. And an immense feeling of shame washed over me. For who I had become, for how far I had fallen, for how my kaln might see me when thi grows up. There was only one option to me: I had to be the mother thi needed. So I begged Setre to let me raise hae, and we came to an agreement. There were many days when I felt the feverish hand of death upon me while I was in withdraw, but she watched over me, kept me hydrated, kept me sober. Until one day she stopped coming around, and I realized that I had already become that mother I was longing to be."

"Setre..." Kipnu said hesitantly, "She's a guardian now, right?"

"Yes... Linyu told me about what happened to you. She does what she must to maintain power among the guardians. Shinna pits them against each other for who can bring in more people."

"She sounds nothing like the person I met last night."

"I know this is hard to believe, but she is careful with her words, and she wouldn't harm anyone unless she thought they were a threat."

Kipnu was starting to have his doubts, but there were still more questions quavering about in his mind.

"So what did happen? How did you become the exiled leader of an island prison."

"I told you this was a long story," thi said with a smirk. "When I was in Rudjan, working with Kanosin patients, I saw myself as just one of many doctors who were pursuing this goal. But after Ulukoma, my life's work became deeply personal and unique. I felt addiction, knew it deeply, like a relationship I wanted so badly to get out of but couldn't. And it was all around me in Ulukoma, affecting almost everyone I knew and had come to love. When I got sober, I could have just left this place - my sentence was long up. But these people were my family now, so for the next Ma'Tova I worked with each one of them to make it out of addiction. The ones that made it swore to me the lives I had given back to them, and learned my methods.

"And then Shinna arrived. Many who fought so hard to break their addiction were seduced by the concept of antikan as a way to 'cheat' on their sobriety, but they never saw a drop. Others just wanted to feel superior over everyone else. Shinna made many empty promises and built an empire on the backs of their labor. Setre never gave up fighting for me and our tribe, grew impatient with my insistence on a peaceful resolution. She was right, of course, and at the end of it she forced me to leave to keep Linyu safe. I promised Setre I would return one day when Linyu was old enough, and I made her swear to me that she would keep the council alive. That day was yesterday. But when Linyu told me thi saw her in the forest, holding you down and taking you away, I knew it was over."

"Why did you come back?" asked Kipnu. "Why would you risk the life of you and your child to be in a place like this?"

"I'm not a child!" said Linyu, getting up from hae chair. Casra took hae hand to calm hae.

"Our people are still here. Linyu's nather is still here. Every person that lived here had a bond to everyone else. Raising children, falling in love, building the village â€“ everything was done with tremendous trust in each other. We accepted our divisions, our arguments; by working through them we accomplished great things. I cannot simply go back to being a Rudjani doctor as if this island wasn't a part of me. I cannot abandon my people to a careless mogul. This is where I belong."

"You speak of them like they're your family."

Thi sighed and paused to think. 

"Do you care about your junds, Kipnu?" thi asked.

He hesitated, now aware of the pendant around his neck.

"Yea," he said. "Of course."

"Would you ever abandon them?"

"No."

"This is the same feeling. It takes time."

He was silent, trying to find words to explain the disconnect in his mind, but the explanation eluded him.

Casra became curious. "Your junds," thi said. "Tell me about them."

<!-- left off -->

"Liffa was... is... everything good in my life. To the rest of Heiko thi is just a farmer, but they don't see hae like we do. Liffa holds us together, but there's this cloud of self-doubt that hangs above hae always. She doesn't pick up on affirmations."

"And your woman?"

"Melna is... a fidelant."

"Why is that the first word you choose to describe her?"

"It's all she does lately. Half of her day is spent in Shaki, so I don't see her as often."

"Do you trust her?"

"Of course! We're bonded."

"Tell me something, Kipnu. Where are they right now?"

He paused to acknowledge a sudden rush of concern for them.

Thi observed and surmised. "They are far from you," thi said.

"Very. Liffa is... going to be sent into space soon."

"Do you trust them to go on without you?"

"What?"

"The people who come here leave behind lives full of relationships. They invent new worries to keep themselves company with the people they left behind. They think they are irreplaceable to their loved ones. But then they leave this place and return to find that the hole they left had been filled by someone or something else; the personas they were building before had vanished, and some can't handle knowing this. They placed their faith in the lives they had left behind, rather than the lives they were living. So... do you trust them to do what's best for themselves, and not necessarily what's best for you?"

He was aghast at imagining what he was saying. He stammered, "We're bonded, we do what's best for each other."

"A bond is something you say once, in a time of your life you hardly remember, with a feeling you'll never have again. Its meaning is just inscriptions on pendants. It's a gamble that you'll always be content stuck to each other."

"What are you getting at?"

"I want you to learn the trust that I know, Kipnu. It's a trust that plunges you into the depths of who you are with only the people you love by your side. And everyday, you decide to go a little deeper with them into the darkness instead of heading back. You are a good man, Kipnu. You've shown us that you have the courage to do the right thing, but your family needs all of you to survive. Ulukoma needs you to survive. We don't need a hero."

Kipnu kept shaking his head, unwilling to open up to understanding.

Casra paused, thinking, and then stood up to say, "Come outside, I have something to show you."

"I don't want to go outside. I just want to sit and think for a while."

"I'll be outside near the big tree when you're done thinking."

Thi paused to look at Kipnu before lifting Linyu up the ladder and then climbing it haeself.

Kipnu stubbornly sat in silence for a while, thinking about nothing. With a sigh, he stood up and climbed up to the surface.

Casra was sitting by the coil on the large tree, and began talking once Kipnu was close enough.

"Set is from Holrag. She told me once that they have these coils on some of the trees there. She wanted me to figure out what they're for."

Kipnu's interest suddenly grew, as he had almost forgotten about Fajro and Holrag in all of the chaos. "Did you figure it out?"

"I did. I tried different size coils and attached different things to the ends of it until I got something to work. I think they're some sort of listening device."

"Listening? To what?"

"Signals in the air? Ghosts? Whoever decides to transmit what they hear. I just learned how to do it before I left Ulukoma, but Holrag must know all about them by now if Set grew up with them."

"So you're saying people from Holrag can just talk to each other over vast distances with nobody butting in? Why can't we hear them?"

"I don't know, but they must be electrical because-"

"I want to hear them. Take me."

<!--
"There's something else. I'm sure you saw the big coil around the tree you were hiding behind."

"It's hard to miss."

"Those coils are picking up some sort of signal in the tree. I don't know what it is, but you can clearly hear a pattern."

"Maybe its..."

"Maybe it's what?" Thi asked eagerly.

"Ara. It's being blocked by... something."

"And you know this... how?"

"My jundwoman is the fidelant for Heiko. The observers at Heiko found some anomalous objects in space that have been blocking Ara and are growing in number. They predict an ice age in 60 days."

"WHAT?!"

"I know this sounds outlandish, and I wish I was kidding. But our observers are rarely wrong, and we've already seen the beginnings of a cold snap."

Kipnu noticed Linyu's face, turning more worried with the second. Thi was old enough to know what an ice age meant, but not quite old enough to know how to handle that knowledge.

"I'm sorry... I may have said too much."

Casra looked down at Linyu, and leaned in to hug hae. Thi looked back at Kipnu and said, "It's fine. It's better to face reality prepared, than to live in willful ignorance."
-->

He rushed over to the chimney to set his bowl down where theirs had been and turned to go back out but a faint sound of rustling leaves echoing through the chimney perked his ears up. He motioned to them to stay quiet and they all listened as the footsteps approached their dug-in shelter.

"Someone's here," he whispered.

Casra hurried Linyu over to their hay bed in the corner of the room, and pulled out two steel-tipped poles from under it, tossing one to Kipnu.

"I'll go first," thi said.

Kipnu watched as Cas went up the ladder and cracked the door to peer through. From the corner of his eye, he could see Linyu cowering in the corner under a blanket.

"Stay here," Casra commanded Kipnu. Thi went up through the door, and Kipnu went up the ladder to watch and listen.

The figure in the dark had an unmistakable spear - Setre was here.

"Cas. You've come back?", she asked in a bewildered tone. "Are you holding Kipnu here? Don't lie to me."

"So what if I am?"

"I captured him. He is property of our tribe, you know this."

"People cannot be property. Set, who have you become?"

"I'm not your right-hand knight anymore. You have no idea what happened in the all the la'to you were gone. We all had to grow stronger because of your weakness."

"When I left, you had such conviction and even more strength than I had. You knew everything I knew. Shinna could have been brought to justice and the Great Pavilion reformed, but now it's gone back to being a cesspool of addiction."

"We needed you, and you left right as everything was falling apart. Now you come back and expect me to have picked up the pieces by myself? The only way to survive was to adapt, so yes, Casra, this is who I am now."

"I understand. And Ramne?"

"He became a dealer. Shipped off to Yansha long before his sentence. Probably bribes."

"No..." Casra paused to fully understand what this meant. "All of our work... was in vain."

She regained hae composure and said, "Please... Tell me what happened."

"There is a network of spies in every tribe, hidden from view, plotting and scheming to bring them down from the inside out. Nobody knew who might be lurking behind a corner or sabotaging every plan. Shinna has removed all other tribes from the Great Pavilion and killed people in hae own tribe that thi suspected of espionage."

"Why didn't you take action to stop it?"

"How do you stop an army you can't see?"

They both looked at each other, at a loss. Kipnu could see Casra's longing stare in the blue gleam of Setre's skin.

"Set... I'm sorry."

"Don't be sorry, Cas," she said, "If I were anyone else, you would be sold to Shinna by now and I would be planning what to do with my reward. But I love you too much to do that, and I believe - I know - that you can bring some humanity back to the land of Ulu."

Setre looked toward the entrance to the safehouse and called, "Kipnu!"

He went up the ladder and walked out to meet them, with Linyu not far behind. The kaln ran to Setre and gave her a leg-hug, which she kneeled down to return after some hesitation.

Kipnu leaned to Casra and asked, "You were bound?". Thi confirmed with a nod.

Setre lifted herself back up and said to Kipnu, "Your hardships aren't over. The whole island knows how valuable you are. Stay out of sight and help Cas."

He looked at her in a different light now. His fear for her had been mostly replaced with reverence, though the little bits of it had lingered in an animalistic sense of survival.

"Setre...how will you-"

She put her hand over his mouth saying, "Don't worry about me," and turned to Casra. They stared at each other for several seconds, desire in their eyes for things to go back to the way they were before. But this was now, not then. Setre turned to walk back the way she came.

Casra called out to her, "The wind speaks!"

Setre responded, "Ulu listens!"

They looked on as the forest swallowed her cursed blue light, a living memory of Ara wandering in the darkness.

<!--


"What if we built a counter resistance. A silent "

Setre stopped, considering the idea, but then shook it off.

"Nonsense," she said, "Shinna would be ahead at every step."

"We have to be more invisible. More-"

"We? Cas, I never said anything about joining you. You're lucky I didn't come with a band of warriors to take you and your kaln to Shinna. Thi would give me my own tribe for your neck."

"And yet you are here alone, your spear dry and your speech soft."

Kipnu had never seen such a formidable spirit. In the face of capture Cas retained every thread of hae conviction.

Setre removed her spear and held it to Casra's neck. Thi didn't flinch as they both stared each other down.


"You're coming with me," She said in a broken voice, pushing Casra back on the pathway to the Great Pavilion.

Kipnu leapt up and forward to get through the door and run after them. Linyu wasn't far behind.

He called out, "Stop!"

Setre turned to face him. "Kipnu, don't try to stop us."

She didn't move a muscle as Linyu ran straight to hae mother. Casra picked hae up and took the crying kaln around hae neck.

"Lin...Mom's going away for a bit," thi tried to console Linyu.

"You have to be strong now. Ulu is dangeorus place. Teach Kipnu everything we went over before, and don't leave his side. He needs you."

Casra turned to Kipnu and said, "Kipnu...This is how it must be. This is how we change the Great Pavilion for good. Learn from my kaln and stop the cold you speak of."

He pleaded to hae, "This is what you want? To give up?"

"I'm not giving up. ," thi replied.

Casra set hae kaln down and bid hae run off to Kipnu, but Linyu stood still, unwilling to accept that hae mother was leaving. Kipnu's heart was full of rage at Casra's fate and he willed to do all in his power to save Cas while he was here.
