## Chapter 10

Kipnu's feet ambled through the forest at a near jogging pace, following the path that his eyes tried to trace through the overwhelming darkness of the dense forest. The kanosin had no trace left in his eyes, but the blue line at his chest was the only things keeping him from running into a rogue branch or a raised root.

"Two thousand paces," he repeated out loud. "Can't be much father."

He looked upward at the leaves and branches dancing along the deep purple sky above him as he listened to the breeze, hoping to hear some hint of a fallen tree or the soft footsteps of his mysterious savior. But only the cold wind spoke to him. He held tighter to the black coat that Setre had put on his body, shuddered at the memory of her body against his. Though he knew what had happened to him was real, it felt like a dream, as if his mind had distanced itself from reality to keep moving on with life.

He came across a tree with a coil set into its trunk, just like the ones he'd seen when Setre was taking him in. _I must be near wherever I'm supposed to go. What are these coils for?_ He took a closer look at the sap-covered copper spiral, imagined the years of experience it must have taken to make something metallic look so perfectly organized. _Probably some old maman and hae trinkets_, he thought to himself.

Amidst the quiet observation he sighed and felt the exhaustion he'd gathered that morning catching up to him. So he rested himself below the coil and gazed into the darkness from where he had fled.

"Damn this cold," he whispered to himself. He curled up into himself, his body shivering from exposure, but it was only a temporary relief. _I wonder if Setre is searching for me_. His thoughts meandered to the memories of her face, closed and sinking into his shoulder. The feeling of panic and confusion and euphoria. _Did I want it to happen?_ he asked. _Did I enjoy it?_ A knot grew in his stomach.

"Liffa, Melna," he spoke to the wind as if they were listening. "I've broken our oath." A tear began to fall down his cheek. The first he'd had time to shed. "Melna, you must understand I..." he gasped for an explanation but he knew he had none. Who would believe him? Who could possibly understand what's happened here? He thought of Liffa, wondered if thi was being treated well or if Fajro really was using hae life to bargain with the senate. Maybe Melna was doing better. She always remained composed while the rest of the world was teetering at the edge of madness.

Kipnu heard quick footsteps approaching behind him, and he quickly stood up and covered his brightly-lit body.

"Kipnu?" a maman called his name. He'd half-expected Setre, or the faceless maman who congratulated him, but he could immediately tell this person was a stranger. There was a distinct tone to hae voice: warm and earnest and full, and not so saccharine as many were. Thi passed by him, looking around, but didn't notice him standing a few paces away, watching as thi circled around the area and placed hae hands on a tree that grew diagonally from the ground. Hae hands came to hae chest and clutched an object in hae coat. Thi fiddled with it and gradually a small bright flame grew from a glass enclosure: a lantern of sorts. In the warm light he could see a fractured trunk and the many branches that suspended it above the ground.

He hesitated, but he knew he should say something. "I'm not here for trouble," he said, walking slowly from the tree. He maintained the distance between them.

"Kipnu, you've made it!" thi said. "Come in, come in. We have much to–"

"No," he stopped hae. "I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on. Who are you? How do you know the maman that sent me here?"

"My name is Casra and I can tell you everything you want to know, but right now we need to get inside. It's not safe out in the open like this."

"Out in the open?" he balked. "The trees are thicker than clay out here."

Casra maintained hae calm but urgent tone. "I know you have no reason to trust a stranger from what you've seen out here, but you can see yourself that I'm not like the others. I have a place of refuge here. Safety from the guardians and the cold."

He observed: hae spartan coat and trousers, a well-used lantern, and no sign of kanosin in hae skin. Casra might not be with Shinna but he'd quickly learned to measure everyone on Ulukoma with an eye of distrust.

"How many are here?" he asked.

"It's just my kaln and I," thi said.

"You brought a child to this place?"

Before Casra could reply, the ground beneath the fallen tree moved, and a kaln climbed out. Kipnu recognized hae face in the lantern light. "You! You're that kaln from the ship!" he exclaimed. "What was it that woman called you... Linyu?"

Linyu walked toward Casra and grinned at him as thi stared at his chest. "You're blue now," thi said. Casra admonished hae, "Linyu!", but Kipnu laughed. His eyes met again with Casra's and a sense of warmth came over him. He was in good company here.

The entrance Linyu had come through was a wooden door with just enough space to fit Kipnu's lumbering body with a strange black long coat draped over his shoulders. As he set foot upon the floor of their home, he looked around and saw the same warmth he heard in Casra's voice: a sort of cooking area to the left, a large bed at the far end, and a hand-made table to the right where Linyu was lighting another lantern. Casra had already prepared him a set of thick kelpen trousers and held them out with a stern posture as if to insist he wear them before stepping any further.

"Lin," thi said. "grab a few paocha leaves from the cupboard."

The kaln rose to fulfill hae mother's request and chimed at Kipnu, "I didn't mean to call you blue. I think blue looks good on you."

Casra took a satchel from the kaln and pulled out two small dried leaves with hae finger. "Here, rub some of this on your tongue and then wash it down with some water. It will taste bitter for a bit, but it keeps you warm."

He hesitated, not wanting to fall prey to another strange substance, but he trusted that Casra had good intentions. He placed a leaf upon his tongue and immediately winced at the bitter tannic flavor. "It's doing its work," Casra reassured him. The bitterness went away after a moment, leaving behind a pleasantly sweet flavor and a warm current in his blood. Casra took out another small leaf and broke it in half for haeself and Linyu.

Kipnu paused, wondering if he should mention the obscura, but Casra broke the silence for him.

"I hear you're a physician from Heiko," thi said.

Kipnu's hearts skipped a beat. "How could you possibly know that?" he asked. "You weren't at the fire. I would have noticed someone following me."

"You're very perceptive, Kipnu," thi said. "I didn't mean to startle you. I'm afraid I can't answer your question until I know that I can trust you. Do you understand?"

He looked suspiciously into hae eyes, trying to see beyond the veil of hospitality, but he saw no signs of deceipt. "Yes," he said hesitantly. "I'm sorry for my outburst. Being honeset about my trade has only given me trouble out here."

"Oh I know all about that," Casra laughed and looked past his feet to another time thi held in hae mind. "You aren't the only physician in Ulukoma."

"You too? But why? I mean, I'm here for personal reasons. I'm just passing through, you know? But you... you've made a home on this island."

Linyu handed Kipnu a wooden bowl: a clarified soup of fish, fermented seaweed, and Heikoi grain. He'd forgotten how hungry he was and eagerly took the bowl into his own hands, thanking Linyu graciously for the gift.

Casra took a deep breath. "I was a physician once - one of the best in Rudjan. I would often see kanosin addicts that had come directly from Ulukoma looking to escape their addiction and I even developed my own treatment protocol for withdrawal. It was a combination of psychotherapy and sedatives that worked very well. In a stupidly brazen move, I decided to test it on myself to prove to my peers how effective it was, but I vastly underestimated its power and I was unable to pull out of it."

"You were the cause of your own suffering."

"Yes. My junds left me and I was sent here as punishment. This place used to be equitable. The clear-minded still held the power here, but we tried to uplift the addicts. Kanosin was still the only way for us to get anything from the mainland, but we all contributed to its labor. Shinna changed all that, bastardized all of our traditions and enslaved the addicts. Now it's just a cartel, a vicious cycle that we all got caught up in."

<!-- left off -->

"I noticed... a class hierarchy back at the dome."

"Shinna was a chemist in Shaki who somehow stumbled upon an antidote for Kanosin. Then thi came here with hae stockpile of antikan, and instead of giving it to us, thi used it as leverage to gain power over me. Now the upper class use it to get high at night and by morning they're back to normal."

"Wait, gain power over you? So you were a leader here?"

"Yes. One of three that formed a council of sorts. I was pushing for Ulukoma to become an independent province when I was ousted."

"How did you go from an addict to the leader of Ulukoma?"

"That's a long story," thi smiled and looked into hae mind, thinking of a better time.

"I like long stories," he said. "They get me invested."

Thi laughed, and paused to prepare haeself.

<!-- This paragraph feels like a mouth full and felt me confused as to what happened after it. -->

"I guess I'll start where I left off. You remember I mentioned traditions. One of the traditions we used to have was the evening. It used to be a time of storytelling, singing, confessing of love, public mediation. Anyone could stand up and say or do anything they wanted. Then some would group up and explore their sexualities together before sleep, and others would just sleep if they weren't ready. The evening was a place and time where people weaved their lives together and apart and together again, and everyone grew closer to each other because of it. I had been under the addiction, but I had the faculty to understand their words and feel the love of a tribe more deeply than I knew of my junds."

"On my first evening at Ulukoma, I had just met Setre, and she introduced me to the group, told them only the good things that I had told her about myself, and it was then that I knew: Ulukoma was not the lawless prison they said it was. About a ma'to after I arrived, Setre was pregnant and was convinced that I was the mother. At first I couldn't believe what she said, because I thought that kanosin led to impotence. But when I saw Linyu, saw hae eyes peer into mine, I felt... it. I felt motherhood. There it was right in front of me. And an immense feeling of shame washed over me. For who I had become, for how far I had fallen, for how my kaln might see me when thi grows up. There was only one option to me: I had to be the mother thi needed. So I begged Setre to let me raise hae, and we came to an agreement. There were many days when I felt the feverish hand of death upon me while I was in withdrawal, but she watched over me, kept me hydrated, kept me sober. Until one day she stopped coming around, and I realized that I had already become that mother I was longing to be."

"Setre..." Kipnu said hesitantly, "She's a hunter now, right?"

"Yes... Linyu told me about what happened to you. She does what she must to maintain power among the guardians. Shinna pits them against each other for who can bring in more people."

"She sounds nothing like the person I met last night."

"I know this is hard to believe, but she is careful with her words, and she wouldn't harm anyone unless she thought they were a threat."

Kipnu was starting to have his doubts, but there were still more questions quavering about in his mind.

"So what did happen? How did you become the exiled leader of an island prison."

"I told you this was a long story," thi said with a smirk. "When I was in Rudjan, working with kanosin patients, I saw myself as just one of many doctors who were pursuing this goal. But after Ulukoma, my life's work became deeply personal and unique. I felt addiction, knew it deeply, like a relationship I wanted so badly to get out of but couldn't. And it was all around me in Ulukoma, affecting almost everyone I knew and had come to love. When I got sober, I could have left this place - my sentence was long up. But these people had become my family, far more than any I'd ever had on the mainland. So I worked with each one of them to fight the battle of addiction. The ones that made it swore to me the lives I had given back to them."

"And then Shinna arrived. Many who fought so hard to break their addiction were seduced by the concept of antikan as a way to 'cheat' on their sobriety, but they never saw a drop. Others just wanted to feel superior over everyone else. Shinna made many empty promises and built an empire on the backs of their labor. Setre never gave up fighting for me and our tribe, grew impatient with my insistence on a peaceful resolution. She was right, of course, and at the end of it she forced me to leave to keep Linyu safe. I promised Setre I would return one day when Linyu was old enough, and I made her swear to me that she would keep the council alive. That day was yesterday. But when Linyu told me thi saw her in the forest, holding you down and taking you away, I knew it was over."

"Why did you come back?" asked Kipnu. "Why would you risk the life of you and your child to be in a place like this?"

"I'm not a child!" said Linyu, getting up from hae chair. Casra took hae hand to calm hae.

"Our people are still here. Linyu's nather is still here. Every person that lived here had a bond to everyone else. Raising children, falling in love, building the village – everything was done with tremendous trust in each other. We accepted our divisions, our arguments; by working through them we accomplished great things. I cannot simply go back to being a Rudjani physician as if this island wasn't a part of me. I cannot abandon my people to a careless mogul. This is where I belong."

"You speak of them like they're your family."

Thi sighed and paused to think.

He glanced at Linyu, saw that thi was eying the pendant underneath his shirt. "You have a family," thi said.

"I do," he said. "And I love them very much."

But Linyu wasn't finished. "Why didn't they come with you?" thi asked.

" There was this guy who wanted to send my jundmaman to space."

Casra laughed until thi noticed that Kipnu wasn't.

"You're not joking about that, are you?" thi asked.

He continued, "I got angry... and I pinned him against a wall. Told him, politely, that he'd made a big mistake."

"Oh. That... must be a long story," thi said.

"No, that's basically it."

Kipnu felt a sense of longing for Liffa and Melna, and he wondered when he would see them again.

"Do you care about your junds, Kipnu?" thi asked.

He hesitated, now aware of the pendant around his neck.

"Yea," he said. "Of course."

"Would you ever abandon them?"

"No."

"This is the same feeling. It takes time."

He was silent, trying to find words to explain the disconnect in his mind, but the explanation eluded him.

Casra became curious. "Your junds," thi said. "Tell me about them."

"Liffa was... is... everything good in my life. To the rest of Heiko Liffa is just a farmer, but they don't see hae like I do. Liffa holds the three of us together, but there's this cloud that hangs above hae always. Sometimes I just can't figure hae out"

"And your woman?"

"Melna is... a fidelant."

"Why is that the first word you choose to describe her?"

"It's all she does lately. Half of her time is spent in Shaki. The other half is spent visiting people and getting their opinions, so I don't see her as often."

"Do you trust her?"

"Of course! We're bonded."

"Tell me something, Kipnu. Where are they right now?"

Kipnu was confused at the question.

"They are far from you," thi said, explaining hae conjecture. "Has something happened?"

"I fought for Liffa to stay, and I was sent here."

"And Melna didn't follow you."

"There are bigger things at stake than our joining."

"Then do you trust them to go on without you?"

"Out with it," he said, clearly agitated. "Go on, you want to say something, say it."

"The people who come here leave behind lives full of relationships. They invent new worries to keep themselves attached to the people they left behind. They think themselves irreplaceable, but then they return home to find that the world they left behind had been replaced. The grand personas they were building before had vanished, and some... just can't adjust. They placed their faith in the lives they knew, rather than the lives they were living.

"By deciding not to come here, Melna has decided to continue her own life on its own trajectory – and all the better that she doesn't suffer for your rash decision. So what I'm asking is," and thi leaned forward to look closely into his eyes, "do you trust your junds to do what's best for themselves, even if it means leaving you behind?"

He was aghast at imagining what he was saying. "We're bonded," he stammered, "we do what's best for each other."

"A bond is something you say once, in a time of your life you hardly remember, with a feeling you'll never have again. Its meaning is nothing more than the inscriptions on your pendants. It's a gamble that you'll always be content with each other. If there really is something big at stake, then your lives are about to be thrown into disarray."

"What are you on about?"

He placed the bowl down and paced around angrily.

"Yes, all of us have been separated by distance, but this is all temporary. We'll go back home once things clear up and my sentence ends."

"Kipnu, a man like you doesn't get sent here for nothing. You throw one punch in your life, maybe two. And you mean it. This space thing, whatever it is made you worried for your maman's life. So you must know there's a chance thi doesn't come back. Just as there's a chance that you won't come back."

"No. No no."

He paced around the small area between the table and the entryway.

"I have to go. I have to find Liffa."

He walked to the entryway ladder and contemplated leaving. Casra didn't follow him, but spoke before he could place a hand on the ladder.

"Kipnu," she said his name to stop him. "You're a good man. I know you don't really belong in Ulukoma. But right now, leaving isn't possible. Everyone on this island is looking for you. You could steal a boat, but the waters between here and the mainland are patrolled by bounty hunters just looking for reason to kill. We need to make the most of where we are."

<!--
maybe you could write it in a way where it's clear how disordered his thinking is becoming and how his perception of memory is starting to cloud over with denial
-->

"And what, hide here forever? No. I have to leave now," he placed a foot on the ladder and continued his momentum upward. Thi sighed and got up to follow him outside with Linyu close behind.

Kipnu kept shaking his head, unwilling to accept what had happened. This was all just some minor excursion. Shinna and Setre were just dreams. From the Kanosin. He wasn't really a fugitive. Right?

"Kipnu," said Casra. "What's on your mind?"

"I just want to sit and think for a while."

"I've done enough talking, I suppose it's natural to want to digest it all."

Thi turned to go back inside, but he interjected, "Wait...can you stay...in case someone shows up?"

Thi looked amused, but humored him. "Okay then. I'll wait with you."

He sat awkwardly, replaying the events of the previous night, repeating what Casra said in his mind. He imagined different scenarios to convince fate to change its mind, but found nothing. Distracted, he noticed the two pairs of eyes peering at him the whole time.

"I can't think with you staring at me," he said.

"Sorry," Casra explained, "I didn't want a hunter to come whisk you away when I wasn't looking."

"Very funny."

Thi paused, thinking, and then said, "I have something to show you."

"I'm not in the mood to see anything."

"It'll just be a moment," thi said, already getting up. Linyu, sensing what his mother was doing, ran in front of hae. Together, they cleared the ground underneath a modestly-sized tree, and inspected a coil that had been affixed to it. Linyu produced two wooden contraptions from hae pocket, handing one to Casra and the other too Kipnu. His eyes were drawn to this curiosity that Linyu held in front of him and he took it reluctantly. There was a ring of coiled copper with smaller beads around it and a larger cylindrical metal bead in the middle. They were all fastened to a small wooden plate that was smaller than his hand, carved from the trunk of a tree.

"This is my newest one. Don't break it," thi said. He nodded in confirmation, not sure if he knew how not to break it.

Casra began, "Setre told me once that they have these coils on some of the trees in Holrag. She wanted me to figure out what they're for."

"What does this have to do with anything?" he asked.

Thi ignored his question and continued.

"Linyu tried different size coils and attached different things to the ends of it until one time it vibrated ever so slightly. Like there was some voice speaking to us."

"A message? Come on, it's a tree."

"This tree is a sort of... conduit. It sends and receives messages encoded in the air. Who sends them? I don't know. But my guess is the Holragi."

"So the Holragi can talk to each other through trees? You realize how ridiculous that sounds?"

"This is why you must listen," said Casra. Linyu lifted the wooden instrument to his ear, and at first he heard nothing.

"Silent, right?" thi said. "Listen closer."

He focused his mind and listened closer to the faint static that entered his ear and a pulsing, rhythmic pattern began to emerge. It had the sound of a man's voice within it, in a tone like nothing he had ever heard before.

"A voice" he exclaimed. His mind had turned in an instant. "But the words. They're unintelligible."

"Those signals are new, coming from a place far, far away," thi explained. "Normally we couldn't hear them on account of the trees making all sorts of noise. But they've gone silent as of late."

Thi turned toward the coil with a piece of metal in hae hand and spoke into it, "But if the speaker is near, they can be heard as though they were standing right next to you," and like a ghost in his own mind, hae voice pierced the noise and entered his head in its muffled timbre. The sound echoed and reverberated off of some unseen pattern of walls in the ether.

Kipnu was confused. "How?" He asked, "I don't understand."

"I was confused too, at first," said Casra. "Imagine that we live on different sides of an unsurmountable wall. We can't see or hear each other, but I know you exist, and you know I exist. We could talk by throwing rocks with messages carved in them, or we could carve a hole in the wall and speak through that. But what if, instead, you put your ear to the wall while I knocked on it from the other side. And now imagine that I had a machine - something that knocks so quickly that it sounds like a person's voice. Now imagine you wanted to tell a hundred people something. Would you rather throw a hundred rocks, or tell them to listen to the wall?"

"So... those coils... they're the machines you were talking about?"

"The trees are the machinery. The coils and the metal beads merely carry our voices."

"And the wall is...?"

"All of the universe. The darkness, the light; the soil beneath us, and the sky above us. This invisible wall permeates everything. If someone knocks, you need only put your ear to it. The wind speaks, as we say."

"Ahh I see," he said, not quite understanding. "I'm impressed, honestly I am, but why did you want to show me this?"

"When I was a councilmaman here, and people made the decision to leave the tribe and return to their lives on the mainland, I would give them a listener and every night I gave them an update on life in Ulukoma. For me, it was a way to let them know that they would always have a home under Ulu."

Thi took his hand and spoke to him earnestly.

"There are many dangers in this place, Kipnu. And we may get separated at some point. Linyu and I made a home from this hole in the ground long ago, and this listener is how we kept track of each other and warned each other of danger. It was our lifeline to each other, and now we are inviting you to join us."

<!-- as a reader I'd love to understand more of why Casra is offering this... -->

Kipnu was feeling tense at her words. He looked at Linyu for some sign that things were not as dangerous as hae mother was saying, but thi also had a serious look.

"Look, I know to stay away from guardians. I can handle myself in a fight. I don't mean to disappoint you but I'm planning to leave as soon as I can."

"Linyu told me about what happened in the forest. Setre captured you only paces away from the treeline?"

<!--  I feel like he'd say something more like "This time I know what/who to look out for." -->

He flushed with frustration, "I was thoroughly into those woods."

Linyu smirked, knowing exactly how many paces he had gone.

"Maybe you're on your way out. Maybe you'll be gone by the end of the day," said Casra. "Either way, take this with you. Maybe you'll hear us and remember us when you're back at home."

He fumbled for some response, then acknowledged that he had been rash to dismiss hae offer.

Sensing his turnaround, thi held up the device and asked, "May I?"

"Sure," he said, bending his ear toward hae to fasten it. The metal of the coil was cold to his ear, but it quickly turned warm with the heat of his head.

Thi took his empty bowl and placed it in a basin, pushing hard on an adjacent lever to produce water. He wondered where that water came from, but his mind could no longer bear a word of new knowledge. A sleepy look appeard on Linyu's eyes, an he acknowledged it in himself as well.

Casra, without looking, said, "You two should get some rest. I'll keep watch."

Linyu got up and walked toward the bed.

"The floor is good," he said to himself, settling into a space underneath the table.

Linyu fetched him a pillow, filled with what he presumed was old dried leaves. To his surprise, it was comfortable, and the ground was warmer than it should have been in such a cold place. He settled into his spot, felt a great weight folding over his eyehaw, and listened as the sounds of Casra's movements settled near Linyu. Casra's voice mulled over the walls in a soft hum, painted them with the words that lay behind them. Words that Linyu already knew. Words that Kipnu didn't need to.

Casra noticed that Kipnu was getting sleepy. Thi whispered to him, "Hey, why don't you rest. We're safe out here on the beach."

He nodded and lied down next to the two of them, taking one last glance at the kaln to check his breathing, and drifted off to sleep. Casra looked at him admiringly, as if to wonder how such a good heart could be sent to such a miserable place. But thi remembered that all people have a dark side, including herself.
