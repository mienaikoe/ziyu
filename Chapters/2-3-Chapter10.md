## Chapter 10


A hand fell upon Kip's back and stayed there - intentional, not accidental. He looked up to see the chaos ahead of him, and turned to find the person behind. It was a maman with the same reed clothing and a veil of dark green. Thi was looking at the crowd so as not to rouse suspicion.

"Stay low and walk ahead of me," thi said. He could almost place the voice. Thi paused for Kip, holding hae hand out slightly for him to take it. He had no reason to trust this phantom but was desperate for a way out, so he took hae hand and walked as slowly and quietly as he could. When they got behind Lissa, the veiled figure bent down to him and whispered, "Towards Ulu. Stop under the fallen tree. Run!", pushing Kip out of the tent. He looked back for a second and saw nothing but the door to the tent closed. Stark naked, severely malnourished, and fighting withdraw from something he did not know, he made a break for some fallen tree he had never seen before in the darkest part of the island.

*I've escaped! But surely they'll be after me soon.*

The forest was darker here, but he found that somehow he could see better than yesterday. Perhaps it was the light from the blue line he had been marked with, or his eyes adjusting to an eternal nighttime. It was still quite difficult to look for fallen trees in a forest of gigantic trees that block a great deal of view in any direction. He made a point to listen more intently for places where the light breeze would whistle across the bark. Maybe a fallen tree would likely sound a bit different, he thought.

He came across another tree with a coil around its base. This time, the coil was polished and covered in sap, presumably from the tree it was wrapped around, and again one of the ends climbed the tree. *That veiled maman must have put these around. Who is thi?* He wanted to stop to observe, but he forced himself to continue on to the tree he was told of. About ten more steps, and he quickly found a wall of a giant fallen tree thrusting its behemoth roots toward the sky. He rested himself on the roots and gazed into the darkness from where he had fled.

"Damn this cold," He whispered to himself. His body shivered but it could only find temporary relief. He tried retracing the events of last night in his head. He remembered inhaling something, and then feeling suddenly euphoric with Setre and Lissa on top of him. He felt a knot grow in his stomach and tighten both of his hearts. *Did I want it? Of course not, I'm bound... Maybe I did want it... want them... Do I belong here? Am I...corrupt?*

A headache had set in again, and he pushed on his eyes to ease the pain. Lif came into his imagination - strapped into a train without rails, flying beyond the edge of the sky. He wondered thi was being treated as he was, if Fajro was using hae life to bargain with the senate. Maybe Mel was having better luck with the senate, remaining her cool and composed self while the rest of the world teeters above a cliff of mindless panic. *Would they understand? Would they accept what I've done? What would I do if they didn't?*

Behind him, Kip heard quiet and quick footsteps approaching. He quickly got up to his feet and ducked behind a tree, waiting for the footsteps to approach before he decided his next move.

"Kipnu," the maman called, quietly. He could faintly see the silhouette of the one who approached him. It was that same familiar voice of the veiled figure, but the veil had been removed. He looked closer at hae and finally recognized who it was.

"Casra? Casra! Is that you?"

Kip was immeasurably relieved to see a familiar face, even if only an acquaintance.

Thi said, "Kipnu, you've made it! Come now, under the fallen tree."

They walked no more than 50 paces before coming to the base of a massive tree that had been uprooted almost a la'to ago. Casra cleared some leaves from the base and opened a wooden door that had just enough space to fit one person at a time. Casra descended into the dimly-lit depths below and beckoned Kip to follow hae. Once inside, Kip could see a small lantern being lit by a small maman. He squatted down, both to cover himself and to gain some warmth. Casra had already prepared him a set of reed cloths and thi helped him into them.

"Linyu, grab some ankan from the cupboard."

"Hi Kipnu. Thank you for saving me," the kaln said to him.

"Hey there... So this is... your mother?"

Thi nodded.

Kip was apprehensive but glad he finally understood what was going on.

Casra took a satchel from Linyu and dipped hae finger in it. "Here, rub some of this on your tongue. You'll feel some stinging at first, but it will subside."

He did as she told and immediately winced. "Tha a ot o siging," he tried to say.

"It's doing its work," thi reassured him. Out of the corner of his eye, Kip could see the kaln eying the ring around his ankle. After a minute, the stinging went away along with his headache and his mental haze.

"It's... gone. What is that stuff?" he asked.

"Kipnu, I have a great deal to explain. This is my kaln, Linyu. We arrived here together yesterday, on your boat, but we used to live here for many ma'to before."

Linyu handed Kip a square reed bowl of some sort of fish stew, and he eagerly took it and started eating without pause. Linyu was surprised and awkwardly took a seat next to his mother.

In between spoonfuls, he asked, "Why have you come back to a place like this?"

"I spent three ma'to here. I started like most people here - a slave and a kanosin addict. The stuff is made here so it's very easy to get. I worked in the darkness and resigned myself to the addiction. When my kaln arrived on the island, I was changed. There was only one choice for me: sober up and be the mother I couldn't be before. I wish I could say that I never had second thoughts, but addiction has a way of demonizing parts of your mind."

"Many mothers choose the pipe. You did the right thing."

"Thank you for thinking so, but..."

"What is it?"

"Before I was a Kanosin addict, I was a doctor - one of the best in Shaki harbor. I would often see addicts that had come directly from Ulukoma looking to escape their addiction and I developed my own treatment protocol that worked very well. In a stupidly brazen move, I decided to test it on myself to prove to my peers how effective it was, but I underestimated the importance of an external motivator and I was unable to pull out of it."

"You were the cause of your own suffering."

"Yes. I lost my spouses and my kaln, and I was sent here as punishment. When I found out that Lin had been sent to me as neither of my other spouses wanted hae, I decided to sober up. There were many days when I felt the fervid hand of death upon me, but Lin watched over me, kept me hydrated and comforted. I owe my life to hae."

Thi gently leaned into Linyu who reciprocated the gesture.

"That struggle left an indelible mark on me. My life's work had become deeply personal and I resolved to help the rest of my tribe out of addiction and out of slavery. For the next Ma'Tova I built each one of them into a functional, social, living ex-addict and they swore to me the lives I had given back to them. My tribe became the largest and most powerful in Ulukoma and we were happy, but I would never had imagined someone like Lissa arriving here. Thi had been a chemist and botanist in Yansha, and somehow had stumbled upon an antidote for Kanosin, the same one I've given you. Instead of giving it to people in need, thi created a stockpile and used it as leverage against them. Many of my own people gave into hae manipulation and fell back into addiction. For those thi wanted to keep slaves, thi simply refused the antidote, while keeping kept her loyalists blissful and healthy by giving them single doses every night as a reward. When kanosin didn't work, thi used sex and money to lure my people and turn them against me. My closest friend, Set, fought on my behalf but once Lissa started forming a band of thugs, I knew that I could never win."

"Set as in Setre? Thi was with you?"

"Oh yes. 

was an orphan in Holragi, moving with her clan from settlement to settlement, toiling for hours at the iron furnaces to build the infrastructure they have today.

"Yes. she had been a child slave in Holragi, toiling for hours to keep the iron furnaces hot. When she was still just a child, she escaped to Shaki and searched for a place to call home, but could never trust anyone long enough to settle down. She came to Ulukoma willingly, not as an addict or criminal, but a warrior looking for a purpose, and somehow she found it in me. To be honest, I don't remember how we met. Kanosin has a way of erasing your memories. But somehow in those grueling days of fighting the addiction, I had come to trust her. We became... close. Very close... But then Lissa came onto the scene, and Set grew impatient with my insistence on a peaceful resolution. When Lin and I left this island, I promised Set I would return one day, and I made her swear to me that she would keep our tribe alive. But when Lin saw Set in the forest, holding you down and taking you away, I knew she had given up."

"So everything you came back for is gone."

"My people are still here. Drugged and enslaved. I can't go back to being a doctor. This is where I belong - in the dark, making a home for the forgotten."

"That's quite noble of you," Kip said.

<!-- There's a fair bit of friction here -->

"And there's something else. I'm sure you saw the big coil around the tree you were hiding behind."

"It's hard to miss."

"Set is from Holragi. She told me once that they have these coils on some of the trees there. She wanted me to figure out what they're for."

Kip's interest suddenly grew, as he had almost forgotten about Fajro and Holragi in all of the chaos. "Did you figure it out?"

"I did. I tried different size coils and attached different things to the ends of it until I got something to work. I think they're some sort of listening device."

"Listening? To what?"

"Signals in the air? Ghosts? Whoever decides to transmit what they hear. I just learned how to do it before I left Ulukoma, but Holragi must know all about them by now if Set grew up with them."

"So you're saying people from Holragi can just talk to each other over vast distances with nobody butting in? Why can't we hear them?"

"I don't know, but they must be electrical because-"

"I want to hear them. Take me."

"There's something else. I'm sure you saw the big coil around the tree you were hiding behind."

"It's hard to miss."

"Those coils are picking up some sort of signal in the tree. I don't know what it is, but you can clearly hear a pattern."

"Maybe its..."

"Maybe it's what?" Thi asked eagerly.

"Ara. It's being blocked by... something."

"And you know this... how?"

"My wife is the senator for Heiko. The observers at Heiko found some anomalous objects in space that have been blocking Ara and are growing in number. They predict an ice age in 60 days."

"WHAT?!"

"I know this sounds outlandish, and I wish I was kidding. But our observers are rarely wrong, and we've already seen the beginnings of a cold snap."

Kip noticed Linyu's face, turning more worried with the second. Thi was old enough to know what an ice age meant, but not quite old enough to know how to handle that knowledge.

"I'm sorry... I may have said too much."

Casra looked down at Linyu, and leaned in to hug hae. Thi looked back at Kip and said, "It's fine. It's better to face reality prepared, than to live in willful ignorance."

He rushed over to the chimney to set his bowl down where theirs had been and turned to go back out but a faint sound of rustling leaves echoing through the chimney perked his ears up. He motioned to them to stay quiet and they all listened as the footsteps approached their dug-in shelter.

"Someone's here," he whispered.

Casra hurried Linyu over to their hay bed in the corner of the room, and pulled out two steel-tipped poles from under it, tossing one to Kip.

"I'll go first," thi said.

Kip watched as Cas went up the ladder and cracked the door to peer through. From the corner of his eye, he could see Linyu cowering in the corner under a blanket.

"Stay here," Casra commanded Kip. Thi went up through the door, and Kip went up the ladder to watch and listen.

The figure in the dark had an unmistakable spear - Setre was here.

"Cas. You've come back?", she asked in a bewildered tone. "Are you holding Kipnu here? Don't lie to me."

"So what if I am?"

"I captured him. He is property of our tribe, you know this."

"People cannot be property. Set, who have you become?"

"I'm not your right-hand knight anymore. You have no idea what happened in the all the la'to you were gone. We all had to grow stronger because of your weakness."

"When I left, you had such conviction and even more strength than I had. You knew everything I knew. Lissa could have been brought to justice and the Shadestead reformed, but now it's gone back to being a cesspool of addiction."

"We needed you, and you left right as everything was falling apart. Now you come back and expect me to have picked up the pieces by myself? The only way to survive was to adapt, so yes, this is who I am now."

"And Ramne?"

"He became a dealer. Shipped off to Yansha long before his sentence. Probably bribes."

"No..." Casra paused to fully understand what this meant. "All of our work... was in vain."

She regained hae composure and said, "Please... Tell me what happened."

"There is a network of spies in every tribe, hidden from view, plotting and scheming to bring them down from the inside out. Nobody knew who might be lurking behind a corner or sabotaging every plan. Lissa has removed all other tribes from the Shadestead and killed people in hae own tribe that thi suspected of espionage."

"Why didn't you take action to stop it?"

"How do you stop an army you can't see?"

They both looked at each other, at a loss. Kip could see Casra's longing stare in the blue gleam of Setre's skin.

"Set... I'm sorry."

"Don't be sorry, Cas," she said, "If I were anyone else, you would be sold to Lissa by now and I would be planning what to do with my reward. But I love you too much to do that, and I believe - I know - that you can bring some humanity back to the land of Ulu."

Setre looked toward the entrance to the safehouse and called, "Kip!"

He went up the ladder and walked out to meet them, with Linyu not far behind. The kaln ran to Setre and gave her a leg-hug, which she kneeled down to return after some hesitation.

Kip leaned to Casra and asked, "You were bound?". Thi confirmed with a nod.

Setre lifted herself back up and said to Kip, "Your hardships aren't over. The whole island knows how valuable you are. Stay out of sight and help Cas."

He looked at her in a different light now. His fear for her had been mostly replaced with reverence, though the little bits of it had lingered in an animalistic sense of survival.

"Setre...how will you-"

She put her hand over his mouth saying, "Don't worry about me," and turned to Casra. They stared at each other for several seconds, desire in their eyes for things to go back to the way they were before. But this was now, not then. Setre turned to walk back the way she came.

Casra called out to her, "The wind speaks!"

Setre responded, "Ulu listens!"

They looked on as the forest swallowed her cursed blue light, a living memory of Ara wandering in the darkness.

"What if we built a counter resistance. A silent "

Setre stopped, considering the idea, but then shook it off.

"Nonsense," she said, "Lissa would be ahead at every step."

"We have to be more invisible. More-"

"We? Cas, I never said anything about joining you. You're lucky I didn't come with a band of warriors to take you and your kaln to Lissa. Thi would give me my own tribe for your neck."

"And yet you are here alone, your spear dry and your speech soft."

Kip had never seen such a formidable spirit. In the face of capture Cas retained every thread of hae conviction.

Setre removed her spear and held it to Cas's neck. Thi didn't flinch as they both stared each other down.




"You're coming with me," She said in a broken voice, pushing Casra back on the pathway to the shadestead.

Kip leapt up and forward to get through the door and run after them. Linyu wasn't far behind.

He called out, "Stop!"

Setre turned to face him. "Kip, don't try to stop us."

She didn't move a muscle as Linyu ran straight to hae mother. Casra picked hae up and took the crying kaln around hae neck.

"Lin...Mom's going away for a bit," thi tried to console Linyu.

"You have to be strong now. Ulu is dangeorus place. Teach Kip everything we went over before, and don't leave his side. He needs you."

Casra turned to Kip and said, "Kip...This is how it must be. This is how we change the Shadestead for good. Learn from my kaln and stop the cold you speak of."

He pleaded to hae, "This is what you want? To give up?"

"I'm not giving up. ," thi replied.

Casra set hae kaln down and bid hae run off to Kip, but Linyu stood still, unwilling to accept that hae mother was leaving. Kip's heart was full of rage at Casra's fate and he willed to do all in his power to save Cas while he was here.
