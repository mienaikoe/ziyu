<!--

this chapter gets really confusing:
- Casra: Wanted to remain secretive.
  - Does not bargain with Lissa, as Lissa would just enslave hae.
  - Might bargain with Setre, if Setre is an old flame.
- Setre: Wants to maintain her post
  - Captures Kip for slavery
    - May or may not be a ploy to save him
      - An alternate fate would have been Kip getting lost and dying in the forest
      - Or being enslaved by some other tribe where Setre couldn't help him.
      - Or being eaten by the birds
        - Would have to write in some reference to giant silhouettes in the sky.
  - Does not capture Casra or Linyu
    - Setre is secretly playing for Casra's new team.
      - Why doesn't Setre just take him somewhere else then? Why is the shadestead important?
    - Setre doesn't know Casra is back
      - Her dialog in ch8 says otherwise

## CHapter 10


A hand fell upon Kip's back - intentionally, not accidentally. He looked up to see the chaos around him, and turned to find who touched him.

It was a maman with the same reed clothing and a veil of white. Thi wasn't looking at him or at the crowd, but toward the exit.

"Follow Setre," thi said. He could almost place the voice.

Setre moved around the crowd to where Kip was sitting, and paused for Kip, holding her hand out slightly for him to take it. He had no reason to trust her but was desperate for a way out, so he stood up as much as he could and took her hand. Setre and the veiled figure took him behind Lissa and through the entrance of the shadestead. The second the cloth closed, they took his arms and started running with him in their arms. Kip was shocked and confused for a few seconds, but he

to go back to the fire, and turned left, heading in a way he had never gone.










"Casra? Casra! You made it!"

Kip was ecstatic to hear a familiar voice, even if only an acquaintance. He turned around to see her and the child standing behind him dressed in woven reeds as the others had been dressed. Thi was holding a folded set of clothing for him.

"You're one of them?" he asked, clearly apprehensive.

Thi took a step toward him, trying to give him the reed cloth, but he backed away.

"Kipnu... I think I have a lot to explain."

"Why did everyone leave? What's going on?"

"Please, give me some time to explain," Casra pleaded to him while taking another step forward. He took the clothing apprehensively, and began to dress himself.

Thi said, "I bid for you and I won. You are now part of my tribe."

"I would thank you but I don't know you well enough to know if that's a good or bad thing."

"This is my kaln, Linyi. We were sent here together yesterday, on your boat, but we used to live here for many ma'to before."

"So when Linyi was saying that hae mother lives here..."

"Thi was talking about me, yes."

"Why did you come back to a place like this?"

"I spent three ma'to here. I started like most people here - a slave and a kanosin addict. The stuff is made here so it's very easy to get. I worked the darkness and resigned myself to the addiction. When my wife Pokyi was sent here, pregnant with our child, I was changed. There was only one choice for me: the choice to be a mother. I wish I could say that I never had second thoughts, but addiction has a way of demonizing parts of your mind."

"Many mothers choose Kanosin. You did the right thing."

"Thank you for thinking so."

"You still haven't answered my question. Why did you come back?"

"Well, before I was a Kanosin addict, I was a doctor - one of the best in Shaki harbor. I would often see addicts that had come directly from Ulu looking to escape their addiction and I developed my own treatment protocol that worked really well. When I found myself sober in Ulu, I decided I would do the same for those in my tribe. It worked so well that I was able to create a tribe of my own, full of ex-addicts that owed me their lives."

"You grew your power here through medicine."

"More than I could ever have found under Ara."

"Then I guess I should ask why you left."

"I was deposed... Lissa's tribe became dominant through manipulation. You saw firsthand what thi will do to get hae way. Lissa became possessive of some of my men and women and turned them against me. Setre fought on my behalf but I knew that it was best for me to leave."

"Setre? Thi was with you?"

"Yes. Before I left, we were... close. But she was frustrated that I wouldn't do anything to stop Lissa. That I had been too weak on hae. I promised her I would return one day. I taught her everything I knew, hoping she would keep the tradition. When I came back last night, I found her with Lissa's markings and then... we fought. She was going to send us to Lissa until..."

"...until you told her about me."

"I'm sorry, Kip. It was the only way to protect ourselves."

""







because there's something here that kept bugging me back on the mainland."

"What is that?"

"Here in the shadestead, we hunt gigantic birds of prey for food and tools. Nearly all of the ones we find are wounded or elderly."

"So where do they come from?"

"Exactly."
