## Chapter 10


A hand fell upon Kip's back and stayed there - intentional, not accidental. He looked up to see the chaos ahead of him, and turned to find the person behind. It was a maman with the same reed clothing and a veil of dark green. Thi was looking at the crowd so as not to rouse suspicion.

"Stay low and walk ahead of me," thi said. He could almost place the voice. Thi paused for Kip, holding hae hand out slightly for him to take it. He had no reason to trust this phantom but was desperate for a way out, so he took hae hand and walked as slowly and quietly as he could. When they got behind Lissa, the veiled figure bent down to him and whispered, "Towards Ulu. Stop under the fallen tree. Run!", pushing Kip out of the tent. He looked back for a second and saw nothing but the door to the tent closed. Stark naked, and severely malnourished, he made a break for some fallen tree he had never seen before in the darkest part of the island.

*I've escaped! But surely they'll be after me soon.*

The forest was darker here, but he found that somehow he could see better than yesterday. Perhaps it was the light from the blue line he had been marked with, or his eyes adjusting to an eternal nighttime. It was still quite difficult to look for fallen trees in a forest of gigantic trees that block a great deal of view in any direction. He made a point to listen more intently for places where the light breeze would whistle across the bark. Maybe a fallen tree would likely sound a bit different, he thought.

He came across another tree with a coil around its base. This time, the coil was polished and covered in sap, presumably from the tree it was wrapped around, and the ends were almost touching. *The veiled person must have put these around. Who is thi?*

Behind him, Kip heard quiet and quick footsteps approaching. He ducked behind a tree and waited for the footsteps to approach before he decided his next move.

"Kipnu," thi called. Kip could faintly see the figure of the one who approached him. He looked closer at hae and finally realized who it was.

"Casra! Is that you?"

Kip was ecstatic to see a familiar face, even if only an acquaintance.

"Kipnu. Oh thank Ara. Let's get to my safehouse under the fallen tree."

"Lead the way."

They walked no more than 50 paces before coming to the base of a massive tree that had been uprooted almost a la'to ago. Casra cleared some leaves from the base and opened a wooden door that had just enough space to fit one person at a time. Casra descended into the dimly-lit depths below and beckoned Kip to follow hae. Once inside, Kip could see a small lantern being lit by a small maman. He covered himself, remembering he was still naked. Casra had already prepared him a set of reed cloths and shoved them toward him the moment he set foot on the ground.

"Linyu, would you fix our guest a bowl?"

"Hi Kipnu. Thank you for saving me."

"Hey there... So when you were saying that your mother lives here â€“"

"I was protecting hae identity."

Kip nodded, apprehensive, but glad he finally understood what was going on.

Casra started, "Kipnu, I believe I have a lot to explain. This is my kaln, Linyu. We were sent here together yesterday, on your boat, but we used to live here for many ma'to before."

Linyu handed Kip a square reed bowl of some sort of fish stew, and he eagerly took it and started eating without pause. Linyu was surprised and awkwardly took a seat next to his mother.

In between spoonfuls, he asked, "Why did you come back to a place like this?"

"I spent three ma'to here. I started like most people here - a slave and a kanosin addict. The stuff is made here so it's very easy to get. I worked the darkness and resigned myself to the addiction. When my wife Pokyi was sent here, pregnant with our child, I was changed. There was only one choice for me: the choice to be a mother. I wish I could say that I never had second thoughts, but addiction has a way of demonizing parts of your mind."

"Many mothers choose Kanosin. You did the right thing."

"Thank you for thinking so."

"You still haven't answered my question. Why did you come back?"

"Well, before I was a Kanosin addict, I was a doctor - one of the best in Shaki harbor. I would often see addicts that had come directly from Ulu looking to escape their addiction and I developed my own treatment protocol that worked really well. When I found myself sober in Ulu, I decided I would do the same for those in my tribe. It worked so well that I was able to create a tribe of my own, full of ex-addicts that owed me their lives."

"You grew your power here through medicine."

"More than I could ever have found under Ara. But, I was deposed... Lissa's tribe became dominant through manipulation. You saw firsthand what thi will do to get hae way. Lissa became possessive of some of my men and women and turned them against me. Setre fought on my behalf but I knew that it was best for me to leave."

"Setre? Thi was with you?"

"Yes. Before I left, we were... close. Very close... But she was frustrated that I wouldn't do anything to stop Lissa. That I had been too weak on hae. I promised her I would return one day. I taught her everything I knew, hoping she would keep the tradition. When I heard from Linyu that she had Lissa's markings and had captured you, I knew that the tribe had disbanded."

"So everything you came back for is gone."

"My people are still here. Drugged and enslaved. I can't go back to who I was under Ara. This is where I belong - in the dark, in the cold, making a home for the forgotten."

"That's quite noble of you," Kip said.

"And there's something else. I'm sure you saw the big coil around the tree you were hiding behind."

"It's hard to miss."

"Set is from Holragi, and she told me that they have these coils all over the trees there. She wanted me to figure out what they're for."

Kip's interest suddenly grew, as he had almost forgotten about Fajro and Holragi in all of the chaos. "Did you figure it out?"

"I did. I tried different size coils and attached different things to the ends of the coil until I got something to work. I think they're some sort of listening device."

"Listening? To what?"

"Signals in the air? Ghosts? Whoever decides to transmit what they hear. I just learned how to do it before I left the Shadestead, but Holragi must know all about them by now if Set grew up with them."

"So you're saying people from Holragi can just talk to each other over vast distances with nobody butting in? Why can't we hear them?"

"I don't know, but they must be electrical because-"

"I want to hear them. Take me."

"There's something else. I'm sure you saw the big coil around the tree you were hiding behind."

"It's hard to miss."

"Those coils are picking up some sort of signal in the tree. I don't know what it is, but you can clearly hear a pattern."

"Maybe its..."

"Maybe it's what?" Thi asked eagerly.

"Ara. It's being blocked by... something."

"And you know this... how?"

"My wife is the senator for Heiko. The observers at Heiko found some anomalous objects in space that have been blocking Ara and are growing in number. They predict an ice age in 60 days."

"WHAT?!"

"I know this sounds outlandish, and I wish I was kidding. But our observers are rarely wrong, and we've already seen the beginnings of a cold snap."

Kip noticed Linyu's face, turning more worried with the second. Thi was old enough to know what an ice age meant, but not quite old enough to know how to handle that knowledge.

"I'm sorry... I may have said too much."

Casra looked down at Linyu, and leaned in to hug hae. Thi looked back at Kip and said, "It's fine. It's better to face reality prepared, than to live in willful ignorance."

He rushed over to the stew pot to set his bowl down where theirs had been. He turned to go back out but a faint sound of rustling leaves echoing through the chimney perked his ears up. He motioned to them to stay quiet and they all listened as the footsteps approached their dug-in shelter.

"Someone's here," he whispered.

Casra hurried Linyu over to their hay bed in the corner of the room, and pulled out two steel-tipped poles from under it, tossing one to Kip.

"I'll go first," thi said.

Kip watched as Cas went up the ladder and cracked the door to peer through. From the corner of his eye, he could see Linyu cowering in the corner under a blanket.

"Stay here," Casra commanded Kip. Thi went up through the door, and Kip went up the ladder to watch and listen.

The figure in the dark had an unmistakable spear - Setre was here.

"Cas. You're back.", she said. "Are you holding Kipnu here? Don't lie to me."

"So what if I am?"

"I captured him. He is property of Lissa's tribe, you know this."

"People cannot be property. Set, who have you become?"

"I'm not your right-hand knight anymore. You have no idea what happened in the all the la'to you were gone. We all had to grow stronger because of your weakness."

"When I left, you had such conviction and even more strength than I had. You knew everything I knew. Lissa could have been brought to justice and the shadestead reformed, but now it's gone back to being a cesspool of addiction."

"We needed you, and you left right as everything was falling apart. Now you come back and expect me to have picked up the pieces by myself? The only way to survive was to adapt, so yes, this is who I am now."

Casra paused to calm haeself. "Tell me what happened."

"There is a network of spies in every tribe, hidden from view, plotting and scheming to bring them down from the inside out. Nobody knew who might be lurking behind a corner or sabotaging every plan. Lissa has removed all other tribes from the shadestead and killed people in hae own tribe that thi suspected of espionage."

"Why didn't you take action to stop it?"

"How do you stop an army you can't see?"

They both looked at each other, at a loss. Kip could see Casra's longing stare in the blue gleam of Setre's skin.

"Set... I'm sorry."

"Don't be sorry, Cas," she said, "If I were anyone else, you would be sold to Lissa by now and I would be planning what to do with my reward. But I love you too much to do that, and I believe - I know - that you can bring some humanity back to the land of Ulu."

Setre looked toward the entrance to the safehouse and called, "Kip!"

He went up the ladder and walked out to meet them, with Linyu not far behind. The kaln ran to Setre and gave her a leg-hug, which she stopped down to return after some hesitation.

Kip leaned to Casra and asked, "Setre... is she the nather?". Thi confirmed with a nod.

Setre lifted herself back up and said to Kip, "Your hardships aren't over. The whole island knows how valuable you are. Stay out of sight and help Cas."

He looked at her in a different light now. His fear for her had been mostly replaced with reverence, though the little bits of it had lingered in an animalistic sense of survival.

"Setre...how will you-"

She put her hand over his mouth saying, "Don't worry about me," and turned to Casra. They stared at each other for several seconds, desire in their eyes for things to go back to the way they were before. But this was now, not then. Setre turned to walk back the way she came.

Casra called out to her, "The wind speaks!"

Setre responded, "The circle listens!"

And they looked on as the forest swallowed her cursed blue light, a memory of Ara wandering in the darkness.

"What if we built a counter resistance. A silent "

Setre stopped, considering the idea, but then shook it off.

"Nonsense," she said, "Lissa would be ahead at every step."

"We have to be more invisible. More-"

"We? Cas, I never said anything about joining you. You're lucky I didn't come with a band of warriors to take you and your kaln to Lissa. Thi would give me my own tribe for your neck."

"And yet you are here alone, your spear dry and your speech soft."

Kip had never seen such a formidable spirit. In the face of capture Cas retained every thread of hae conviction.

Setre removed her spear and held it to Cas's neck. Thi didn't flinch as they both stared each other down.




"You're coming with me," She said in a broken voice, pushing Casra back on the pathway to the shadestead.

Kip leapt up and forward to get through the door and run after them. Linyu wasn't far behind.

He called out, "Stop!"

Setre turned to face him. "Kip, don't try to stop us."

She didn't move a muscle as Linyu ran straight to hae mother. Casra picked hae up and took the crying kaln around hae neck.

"Lin...Mom's going away for a bit," thi tried to console Linyu.

"You have to be strong now. Ulu is dangeorus place. Teach Kip everything we went over before, and don't leave his side. He needs you."

Casra turned to Kip and said, "Kip...This is how it must be. This is how we change the Shadestead for good. Learn from my kaln and stop the cold you speak of."

He pleaded to hae, "This is what you want? To give up?"

"I'm not giving up. ," thi replied.

Casra set hae kaln down and bid hae run off to Kip, but Linyu stood still, unwilling to accept that hae mother was leaving. Kip's heart was full of rage at Casra's fate and he willed to do all in his power to save Cas while he was here.
