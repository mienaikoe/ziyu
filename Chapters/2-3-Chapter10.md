## Chapter 10

Kipnu's feet ambled through the forest at a near jogging pace, following the path that his eyes tried to trace through the overwhelming darkness of the dense forest. The kanosin had no trace left in his eyes, but the blue line at his chest was the only things keeping him from running into a rogue branch or a raised root.

"Two thousand paces," he repeated out loud. "Can't be much further."

He looked upward at the leaves and branches dancing along the deep purple sky above him as he listened to the breeze, hoping to hear some hint of a fallen tree or the soft footsteps of his mysterious savior. But only the cold wind spoke to him. He held tighter to the black poncho that Setre had given him, shuddered at the memory of her body against his. Though he knew what had happened to him was real, it felt like a dream, as if his mind had distanced itself from reality to keep moving on with life.

He came across a tree with a coil set into its trunk, just like the ones he'd seen when Setre was taking him in. _I must be near wherever I'm supposed to go. What are these coils for?_ He took a closer look at the sap-covered copper spiral, imagined the years of experience it must have taken to make something metallic look so perfectly organized. Amidst the quiet observation he sighed and felt the exhaustion he'd gathered that morning catching up to him. So he rested himself below the coil and gazed into the darkness from where he had fled.

"Damn this cold," he whispered to himself. He curled up into himself, his body shivering from exposure, but it was only a temporary relief. _I wonder if Setre is searching for me_. His thoughts meandered to the memories of her face, closed and sinking into his shoulder. The feeling of panic and confusion and euphoria. _Did I want it to happen?_ he asked. _Did I enjoy it?_ A knot grew in his stomach.

"Liffa, Melna," he spoke to the wind as if they were listening. "I've broken our oath." A tear began to fall down his cheek. The first he'd had time to shed. "Melna, you have to understand..." he gasped for an explanation but he knew he had none. Who would believe him? Who could possibly understand what's happened here? He thought of Liffa, wondered if thi was being treated well or if Fajro really was using hae life to bargain with the senate. Maybe Melna was doing better. She always remained composed while the rest of the world was teetering at the edge of madness.

Kipnu heard quick footsteps approaching behind him, and he quickly stood up and covered his brightly-lit body.

"Kipnu?" a maman called his name. He was expecting Setre or the faceless maman who congratulated him, but with one word he could tell that this person was different. There was a distinct tone to hae voice: warm and earnest and full, and not so saccharine as many were. Thi passed by him, looking around, but didn't notice him standing a few paces away. He looked on as thi circled around the area and placed hae hands on a tree that grew diagonally from the ground. Hae hands came to hae chest and clutched an object in hae coat. Thi fiddled with it and gradually a small bright flame grew from a glass enclosure: a lantern of sorts. In the warm light he could see a fractured trunk and the many branches that suspended it above the ground.

He hesitated, but he knew he should say something. "I'm armed," he bluffed, walking slowly away from the tree. He maintained the distance between them. "Don't come any closer," he said.

"Kipnu, you've made it!" thi said. "Come in, come in. We have much to talk..."

But thi looked back at him as he stared back with eyes colder than the wind. "Who are you?" he asked. "Is this another of Shinna's tests?"

The maman adjusted hae stance, took a step toward him and bowed. "I am Casra and this is my home. We did not lead you here to test your loyalty or give you kanosin. We brought you here so that you could be yourself again, and hopefully help others to do the same. I know you have no reason to trust a stranger from what you've seen out here, but you can see yourself that I live far away from the others for a reason. I have a place of refuge here. Safety from the hunters and the cold."

He observed: hae humble coat and trousers, a well-used lantern, and no sign of kanosin in hae skin. Casra might not be allied with Shinna but he'd learned to measure everyone on Ulukoma with an eye of distrust. "How many are here?" he asked.

"It's just my kaln and I," thi said.

"You brought a child to this place?" he asked. Before Casra could reply, a patch of ground beneath the fallen tree began to open up, and a kaln climbed out. Kipnu recognized hae face in the lantern light. "You're that kaln from the ship!" he exclaimed. "The woman, Setre. She called you Linyu."

Linyu walked toward Casra and grinned at him as thi stared at his chest. "You're blue now," thi said with a clever smirk. "Linyu!", Casra admonished hae but Kipnu chuckled along with Linyu. His eyes met again with Casra's and a sense of warmth came over him. He was in good company here.

The entrance Linyu had popped out of was a wooden door with just enough space to fit Kipnu's lumbering body. As he set foot upon the floor of their home, he took in the sweet piny scent of burning anomin oil. To his left was a small black iron firebox with a pot sitting atop. To his right, a small low table crouched over a thickly-woven kelpen rug, the same material as the long black poncho draped over his shoulders. At the far end of the room a large vinegrass bed was neatly laid in a corner where Linyu was lighting a third lantern perched upon a metal stand. Casra had already prepared him a set of thick kelpen trousers and foot wrappings and held them out with a stern look on hae face as if to insist he wear them before stepping any further.

"Lin," thi said. "grab a few paocha leaves from the cupboard."

The kaln rose to fulfill hae mother's request and chimed at Kipnu, "I didn't mean to call you blue. I think blue is pretty." Hae eyes struggled to meet his, as if thi was thinking about something else. He noticed something on hae face in the light: a wooden circle covering hae left ear, smoothed and oiled by the hands of a tinker. He noted its peculiarity, but felt that it was too early to ask.

Casra took a satchel from the kaln and pulled out two small dried leaves with hae finger. "Here, rub some of this on your tongue and then wash it down with some water. It will taste bitter for a bit, but it keeps your body warm and the cravings at bay."

He hesitated, not wanting to fall prey to another strange substance, but he trusted that Casra had good intentions. He placed a leaf upon his tongue and immediately winced at the bitter tannic flavor. "It's doing its work," Casra reassured him. The bitterness went away after a moment, leaving behind a pleasantly sweet flavor and a warm current in his blood. Casra took out another small leaf and broke it in half for haeself and Linyu.

"I hear you're a physician from Heiko," said Casra.

Kipnu's hearts skipped a beat. "How could you possibly know that?" he asked. "You weren't at the fire. I would have noticed someone following me."

"You're very perceptive, Kipnu," thi said. "I didn't mean to startle you. I'm afraid I can't answer your question until I know that I can trust you."

He looked suspiciously into hae eyes, trying to see beyond the veil of hospitality, but he saw no signs of deceipt. "Yes," he said hesitantly. "I'm sorry for my outburst. Being honest about my trade has only given me trouble out here."

"I understand that very well," Casra laughed and looked past his feet to another time thi held in hae mind. "You aren't the only physician in Ulukoma."

"You too? But why? I mean, I'm here for personal reasons. I'm just passing through. But you... you're enduring so much to stay here."

Linyu handed Kipnu a wooden bowl: a clarified soup of fish, fermented seaweed, and Heikoi grain. He'd forgotten how hungry he was and eagerly took the bowl into his own hands, thanking Linyu graciously for the gift.

Casra took a deep breath. "I was a physician once - one of the best in Rudjan. I would often see kanosin addicts that had come directly from Ulukoma looking to escape their addiction and I even developed my own treatment protocol for withdrawal. It was a combination of psychotherapy and sedatives that worked very well. In a stupidly brazen move, I decided to test it on myself to prove to my peers how effective it was, but I vastly underestimated the potency of kanosin and I was unable to pull out of its grasp."

"You became dependent on it," said Kipnu. "Just like any other addict."

"Yes," thi continued. "I'd failed to realize that the most important part of my therapy was me. I couldn't guide myself toward anything while my body was guiding me back to kanosin. The magistrates of Rudjan had me sent here to save their reputation. I used to be the one they turned to when they had to sentence an addict. 'Rehabilitation not Retribution'. That is what I sold to them, and they took that to the people of Rudjan. But all of that was away by my own ignorance."

"Casra," he said and thi looked up into his eyes. "I can't possibly know your pain. But anyone that's half as ambitious as you are can surely recover from anything."

Casra gazed at him, as if transfixed by his words or perhaps his eyes. "Oh, I'm sorry," thi said, averting hae eyes as if awakened from a daydream. "I shouldn't be yammering about my problems to a stranger.-"

"-No. Please," he interrupted. "I want to know more. About this place. About you. Tell me what you know and I'll tell you about myself." Thi looked at him with pensive eyes; one half trusting, and the other half unwaveringly cautious. He appealed to the trusting half, "Do you remember what they teach us about grieving patients?"

"The rock and the beacon?" Casra asked. Thi balked at his suggestion, "Am I to think of myself as your patient?"

"Would you humor me?" he asked. "You can learn a lot about someone if you know what guides and supports them." He glanced at Linyu who was staring back at him with keen attention. There was a sort of gravity he had with the kaln, as if every word he said carried a story within it.

Casra sighed and paused to think, and then thi began. "Ulukoma used to be a place where trust was normal. The evening was a time of storytelling, singing, confessing of love or desire. Anyone could stand up and say or do anything they wanted. We explored the depths of our minds and bodies together, no matter how difficult or shameful. It was a time of discovery, weaving our lives together and apart and together again, growing closer and wiser with each new breath of understanding."

Thi smiled and started again, "I remember being so afraid on my first night here. We were thrown off the ship just as you were, and I just remember being so confused as I struggled blindly in the water to find my way to safety. Then I heard a voice. 'This way,' she said, and I followed her without a question. She helped me and the others onto the shore where the rest of Ulukoma had gathered to meet us, and she told me her name was Setre."

"Hold on," said Kipnu. "Setre? The Setre that nearly killed me in the forest two days ago? She's the one who saved your life?"

Casra nodded. "I know this is hard to believe, but Setre was my rock through everything. There were many days when I felt the feverish hand of death upon me while I was going through withdrawal, but she watched over me, gave me the comfort I needed in the painful times and the tough love I needed through the cravings. At some point we fell in love, though I don't think I could tell you when. It's a lot like an addiction: You wake up one day and realize that you're already in it."

"Love?" said Kipnu. "Are you certain we're talking about the same person?"

"Setre is a complicated person. You don't know her like I do."

"Few people are as complicated as they say, I've come to find," he said. "I rarely misjudge a person's character."

Casra scoffed. "Are all physicians in Heiko so arrogant?"

"The Setre you used to know is nothing like the Setre I saw back there." He pulled down the side of his trousers enough for Casra to see the bandage he'd placed on his thigh. "She sliced through my skin like it wasn't even there."

Casra looked digusted at the sight but calmed haeself. "Setre plays an important role among the Clothed. A role that she is very good at playing. But that isn't who she wants to be."

"Ask the people she's enslaved if that matters to them. She calls herself a hunter. And her 'prey' are ordinary people that never asked for any of this. Addicts, like you used to be."

"You wouldn't be here, safe with me, if it wasn't for her," said Casra. "The commotion that covered your escape was no accident. Setre had to make sure you were in the right place at the right time."

"Spies?" he wondered aloud. "You mean to say that Shinna's own friends are plotting against hae?"

"Shinna and Setre have their own plans. Sometimes they are at odds with each other, and other times they are in agreement. But they both are trying to survive in this forgotten place."

"Survive?" he laughed mockingly. "They have no other goal but to fulfill their own selfish desires."

Casra did not look amused. "There are many layers to every person, Kipnu, just as there are many layers to this island. Setre sent you to me because she knows you have an unwavering spirit and a curious mind. But all of that is wasted if you choose to remain ignorant."

"I am ignorant of many things, but this is not one of them. I know what I saw. Shinna has built a village on the backs of kanosin addicts, and Setre is the one helping hae make more of them."

Casra formed a wistful wrinkle on hae brow. "Nothing in this place holds a shred of justice, Kipnu. But it would be naïve of you to think that either of them wished for Ulukoma to be this way."

Kipnu rebuked hae, "Look, what I saw in that place – those workers with their vacant eyes and tired limbs. That was wrong. I could feel it. And wrong has to mean something if our lives are to make any sense."

"And you suppose that we didn't try to make it right?" thi asked pointedly. Linyu grasped Casra's hand and settled hae. "You see yourself as superior to us – that it was a mistake to be sent here. But you came to this island as a criminal under the laws of your people, just like everyone else here. Tell me, does your life make any sense now that right and wrong has been decided _for you_?" Thi paused to take a deep breath and wipe the moisture from hae cheek. "Shinna and Setre didn't choose to build things this way. They came to this conclusion by watching me fail to keep this place together. As our numbers grew, smugglers began showing up on our shores, promised food and goods from the mainland: things that I could never provide. But they wanted us to make kanosin in return, and their demands grew and grew until they started to become violent. I tried to lead a protest, but they filled us full of kanosin to keep us quiet. I dodged their many attempts to do the same to me, but there were so many people that needed my help that I couldn't pull them all out of the blue. Then one of the smugglers, Ramne, started to stay on the island, hoping to gain control over our kanosin production. And not long after, Shinna came to Ulukoma with a stolen recipe for antikan. Thi used it to pull some of us out of the addiction, but we knew that even if we gave antikan to everyone, they would quickly turn back to the smugglers for their empty promises of wealth and prosperity. So Shinna made a deal: thi told Ramne that thi could maintain production with far less effort than it took him, and after assuring him that I would be out of the picture, he agreed to stay out of hae business. What you saw back there is what thi had to build in order to keep that promise to him; to keep some of us awake while we watched over those who stayed under, hoping someday to free them all."

"That's... That's ridiculous," Kipnu said. "Shinna has this whole island under hae control. Thi could have all the smugglers thrown into the ocean if thi wanted."

"We would all starve to death if that ever happened," said Casra. "We don't have Ara to do our work for us here. There is no steam to cook with, no steel to build with, and too many people to fish for. Kanosin is all we have to trade for our lives." Hae face was flush with stress and thi looked away to calm haeself down. "And the smugglers know that."

"Then why do you stay here?" he asked. "Why didn't you leave?"

"Our people are still here. Setre is still here. Every person that lived here had a bond to everyone else. Raising children, falling in love, building the village – everything was done with an unbounded trust in each other. We accepted our divisions, our arguments; by working through them we accomplished great things. I cannot simply go back to the mainland as if this place isn't a part of me now. I cannot abandon my people. This is where I belong."

"And your kaln? Is this a good place for hae?"

"Linyu," thi said as thi turned to hae and smirked, "likes to get into trouble. I told hae that guiding people to the shore was dangerous but thi still goes out when it comes by."

Linyu butted in, "They need help," thi said. "They don't deserve to die."

"Nobody deserves to die," Casra replied, "But if you did, I just couldn't live with myself."

"Then come with me," Linyu pleaded.

"You know why I can't," thi replied with a serious look on hae face. Kipnu could tell sense some unease in hae expression, but he wanted to know more.

"Casra, why did you choose to hide out here in the middle of the forest?"

"Shinna would highly prefer if I never came back," thi said.

"So thi and Setre, they think you're gone? Back to the mainland?"

"I don't think they care," thi said. "To them, I am no more a threat than the stars that hide in the veil of Ulu. But they don't know yet that the stars also talk."

Kipnu nodded at the expression. He didn't know what thi meant.

"Kipnu," said Casra with an eager voice, "there's something else I must ask you. Our spies risked their lives to send you here in the hopes that you would return the favor to us. Your help could help change this place back into something good."

He hesitated, letting the weight of what she said pass. "I have only one goal in my life right now: to stop my bundmaman from being sent to hae death. Nothing else matters in this moment. If you were looking for someone to do your bidding, then I'm sorry but I have to decline. I will be off this island as soon as I can find a boat."

Casra stared at him coldly, as if to look at a puzzle or a machine. "A boat...yes," said Casra sharply as thi stood up and snatched the bowl from his hands. The trudging of hae footsteps toward the water basin were as cold as the tension that had filled the room. "You want to leave then. We'll find you a boat tomorrow."

Kipnu sat with his warm belly and Casra's words and weighed his trust for hae. Linyu sat quietly at the table, fiddling with some trinket made of wood and metal. He imagined having to raise a child in this cold wilderness, how lonely it must have been.

"You will freeze to death kong before you make it to shore if you take a canoe," Casra explained with a wet bowl in hae hands. "You could try to ride with a smuggler but they're likely to sell you back to Shinna."

"What about the ship I came in on?" he said. "Couldn't I sneak onboard without them knowing?"

Casra looked at him with eyes of surprise. "You either love your bundmaman very much or not at all, throwing your life away so carelessly," thi said. "Nobody can swim or paddle fast enough to catch a ship like that. You're more likely to get clipped by the boat and be pulled under." Thi sat back down, facing Kipnu and peered deeper into his eyes. "What happened to get you sent all the way out here, anyway?"

"It's complicated," he said.

"Ah. So the reductive man does understand nuance." Casra smirked at him coyly. "Well, I've spoken enough and we have plenty of time. Tell me why you want to go back so badly."

"There was this guy," he started, "who wanted to send hae to space."

Casra let out a laugh of incredulity but stopped when thi saw that Kipnu remained serious. "Oh," thi said. "You're not joking about that, are you?"

"Not at all."

"Why would he want to do such a thing?" thi asked.

He weighed whether he should mention the obscura, but the thought of Liffa couldn't leave his mind. "Liffa is... talented, and brilliant. But being a maman, people often dismiss hae. This time, thi had the opposite problem. Apparently, being small is a benefit when being launched into space on a rail line up a mountain. This man, Fajro, chose Liffa to be the one to go, and I let him know how I felt about that."

"An educated man like you doesn't get sent here for nothing," said Casra. "You throw one punch in your life, maybe two. And you mean it."

Kipnu was surprised that thi could read him so well, but he imagined that such a skill was useful in Ulukoma.

"Tell me about hae," thi said. "Thi sounds like an interesting maman to say the least."

"Liffa was... is... everything good in my life," he said. "To the rest of Heiko Liffa is just a farmer, but they don't see hae like I do. Thi holds Melna and I together and thi does it so well. But there's this cloud that hangs above hae always. Sometimes I just can't figure hae out."

"And your bundwoman?"

"Melna is...," and he paused to find a word - any word. "She's a fidelant"

Casra gave him a puzzled look. "Why is this the first word you choose to describe her?"

"I-," he began but struggled to find an answer. "We don't see her very often. Half of her time is spent deliberating with the other fidelants in Shaki. The other half is spent visiting with people. We spend but a short time in the morning together but that is all."

"Do you trust her?"

"Of course!" he softly exclaimed. "We're bonded."

"Tell me something, Kipnu. Where are they right now?" Kipnu was blindsided by hae question. "They are far from you," thi said. "Has something happened?"

"I fought for Liffa to stay, and I was sent here."

"And Melna?"

He started to mince his words into vague trifles. "There are bigger things at stake for her."

"Do you trust them to go on without you?"

"Go on without me?" he asked, agitated. "I already told you I'm leaving as soon as I can find a way out of here."

"The people who come here leave behind lives full of relationships. Some of them invent new worries to keep themselves attached to the people they left behind. Some die trying to leave this place, never knowing that nothing was left of the life they were chasing. These thoughts are self-destructive. The man you knew will die here, but someone new will take his place. Melna will decide to continue her own life on a trajectory that doesn't include you – that can't include you. So what I'm asking is this." Thi leaned forward to look closely into his eyes. "Do you trust your bound family to do what's best for themselves, even if it means leaving you behind?"

He frowned at hae, exhaled a short impassioned breath. "When you're bonded," he said. "You always do what's best for your family even if it means betting your life on it."

"Whatever it is that has you worried for your maman's life, there's nothing you can do about it when a vast stretch of ocean stands between you and hae. Both of them need you to stay alive for as long as possible. And you have to trust that they will do the same."

"I can't just leave them," he said solemnly. He walked toward the ladder he'd come in on and looked up at the wooden cap that kept the cold out. "Liffa is in grave danger. I have to go find hae at any cost."

He looked back at Casra with conviction in his eyes. Perhaps thi knew more about his own mind than he did in that moment, but he wouldn't be swayed. "I need to sit and think for a while," he said. "I'll be right outside."

"I'll go with you," said Linyu as thi grabbed the wooden puck thi was fiddling with and followed him to the ladder.

"I won't follow you," said Casra to Kipnu. "But be vigilant. I wouldn't want a hunter to come whisk you away when I wasn't looking. Look after him Lin." Thi shot a glance toward Linyu who smirked in response: some sort of language only meant for each other's ears. He blushed for just a moment, recalling his mother's scowls and hums that only he could understand. He wished they hadn't died with hae.

"Follow me," said Linyu, squeezing between Kipnu and the ladder with ease. With one quick swoop, thi was up the ladder and lifting haeself up to the ground. Kipnu carefully placed his feet and hands upon the well-worn wooden rungs, trying least of all to be as agile as a kaln half his age. He glanced back at Casra before he ascended, and for a moment he wished that he could stay with them in Ulukoma.

The cold air bit his cheeks as he emerged from the ground, but Linyu didn't seem bothered. Thi was sitting on the fallen tree, observing with hae hands all the wires and beads intricately woven onto the wooden thing that thi had been working with, and Kipnu's curiosity had reached a peak.

"Linyu," he asked. "What are you working on?"

"A listener," thi replied without looking up.

Kipnu paused, waiting for some kind of explanation. "And what is a listener?" he asked.

Thi paused, thinking, and then stood up and said, "Come with me."

"Linyu-"

"I have to show you something. It'll be quick," thi said.

They arrived at the trunk of a modestly sized tree with a coil of copper affixed to it - the same ones Kipnu had seen when he first arrived at the island. Linyu began brushing debris from the tree and held out the "listener" for Kipnu to take off of hae hands. He carefully took the puck from its wooden edges and observed the intricate details that were affixed to it. It was very much like the coil on the tree, but the copper wire was thinner and more tightly wound, with a small black bead affixed to one end. In the center of the coiled wire was a larger black bead, suspended by six strands of thin wire held taut by winding around six wooden pegs at the edge of the puck.

"This is my newest one," thi said. "Please don't break it." He nodded in confirmation, not sure if he knew how not to break it.

"My nather gave me a listener that she took from Holrag once. She told me that they talk through coils like this on every tree in Holrag."

"They can talk?" asked Kipnu. "To the trees?"

"Not to the trees. _Through_ them."

"I don't understand," he said. "But continue."

"My nather wanted me to figure out how it works by making one. I spent days trying different sizes of wire and attaching different things to the ends of it. And then the bead began to vibrate ever so slightly. The first thing I heard was a woman's voice. '3...0...9' is what she said. That's when I knew."

Kipnu was skeptical. "So the Holragi can talk through the trees. How does it work?"

Linyu smirked. "The air!"

He balked at the idea. "That's not possible. The air is nothing like a wire."

Linyu lifted the wooden instrument to his ear and said, "Listen."

"I don't hear anything," he said.

"Listen closer."

He focused his mind and listened closer to the faint static that entered his ear. A pulsing, rhythmic pattern began to emerge, like the waves of the ocean. But upon them was the sound of a man's voice, in a narrow tone like nothing he had ever heard before. The words were unintelligible, but he knew from the tone and the rhythm that the voice was speaking the Holragi language. He looked around for a Holragi man hiding in the shadows. "Who does this voice belong to?" he asked Linyu, and hae face lit up with excitement. Kipnu stared again the piece of wood in his hands, trying to find any trace of a trick, but there was none.

"Those voices come from a place far away," thi explained. "From someone standing at a tree just like this one." Hae hand found the coil embedded in the wooden trunk of the fallen tree, and with hae other hand thi pushing the listener back toward Kipnu's ear. "But if the speaker is closer..." Thi turned toward the tree and whispered into it, "it sounds like they're standing right next to you."

Like a figment of Kipnu's own mind, hae whispers pierced the noise with their clarity. They echoed and reverberated off of walls he couldn't see, and landed in his ear through this tiny configuration of wood and metal. "How?" he asked. "I don't understand."

"My mother calls it magnetic air. It fills the universe; the dark and the light; the clay beneath, and the sky above. The trees speak to each other like this – the wind speaks, as we say – but we need a wire and a magnet if we want to put our ears or voices on it. And once your voice is on the magnetic air, everyone with a listener can hear you."

"Magnetic air," he repeated in a troubled tone. "I don't quite understand."

Linyu smirked with a smug childish air about hae. "Imagine there's a massive wall between us with you and one side and me on the other. If I try talking to you, you wouldn't hear me. But if you put your ear to the wall while I tapped on it with a hammer, I could send messages to you in some tapping language. Now imagine that I had a hammer machine that taps so quickly that it sounds like a person's voice. I could talk to everyone who had their ear to the wall."

"That makes sense...but it still feels like magic. I wonder how the Holragi kept it a secret for so long." He thought to himself about the mystery of Linyu: the resolve in hae voice when thi led a confused mass of people stranded in the dark ocean to safety, and how that determination evaporated when he saw Setre's face. "Your nather must have had as much bravery as she had cunning to escape Holrag with one of their toys," he said.

"She stole it before she left," thi said. "It kept the loneliness away. Wandering across the world looking for a home can be taxing. It still smells like the bitter smoke that covered her hands every day making steel."

"Escaping as a slave must be-"

"-Steelmaker," thi interrupted. "She was more than a slave."

He swallowed his words, knowing he hadn't been careful with that sharpened word. "I meant no offense," he said. "Steelmaker."

After a moment's pause, he spoke again, "Have you heard any mention of my bundmaman, Liffa, in that listener of yours? You know... from far away?"

"Messages from Holrag are usually too faint to hear, and the messages are cryptic and technical. But I have made out a few of them that are announcements. Usually they're about the Ara line."

"The Ara line! Yes! What have you heard lately?"

"They haven't spoken much lately. They must be building something big," thi said. "Is that where your Liffa is? The Ara line?"

It pained him to pause and think about it, but he gathered himself and replied, "Yes. They want hae to be the first to..." A sigh took to his lungs and forced him to pause.

"The first to Ara?!" Linyu's eyes lit up. "Thi must be so smart."

He stuttered, "Y-Yes, but-"

"I wonder what it smells like in space. Do you get to talk to hae? I want to talk to hae too!"

"No. I don't get to talk to hae. They took hae as punishment for breaking the law."

"Punishment?" Linyu was confused. Kipnu wondered again if he should mention the obscura, wondered if there ever would be a right time. Linyu had grown up fast – this much was apparent – but hae eyes were still full of dreams, potent and fragile; the type of dreams that die big over and over.

"It's a lot to talk about right now. I need to do some thinking of my own before I can tell it. I promise that you'll learn all about Liffa some other time. Just keep your ear to that listener and listen for hae name. Promise?"

Linyu looked back at him, unsatisfied. "Why don't you listen for hae yourself?" Hae arm moved quickly in the darkness and landed on Kipnu's ear. He instinctively moved away but stopped himself when he realized Linyu had a listener in hae hand. With a few clumsy movements of hae hands, Linyu finally attached the device to his ear. "Got it," thi said. "Now you don't need to ask me about them anymore."

Kipnu listened intently to the sound, hoping to hear hae voice, but he heard only static. "Linyu... I really appreciate this gift. I would love to keep it, but I feel like this would be better with someone you know. Is your nather here? Maybe she would like one."

"She already has one," said Linyu. "That's how she found you."

Kipnu was confused for a moment. "Found me?"

"I know you'll be leaving soon," said Linyu. "But I want you to have it. Maybe someday you'll hear my voice and remember us."

He fumbled for some response, then acknowledged that he had been rash to dismiss hae offer. "Of course," he said. "Thank you for this. I'll listen for your voice every day."

Linyu smiled.

Casra's voice called out behind them. "You're still here," thi said. "You should come get some rest before you leave. You'll need whatever strength you can muster if you're really going to try to paddle back to the mainland."

His usual urgency was clouded by a deep lethargy that set into his limbs and eyes.

Casra looked him over and smirked with a knowing expression. "Come," thi said. "We'll find you a place to rest."

"The floor is good," he replied, simply wanting to rest.

Once hae feet hit the floor of their home, Linyu fetched a pillow and blanket and placed them on the floor next to the bed. Kipnu graciously settled into the corner that Linyu had set for him and removed his foot wrappings, feeling his bare feet hit the dry clay below him – oddly warm for such a cold place. He listened as Casra's voice mulled over the walls in a soft hum, painted them with a melody that spoke as if music itself was a language; like a familiar poem that Linyu had heard countless times before, that Kipnu didn't need to.

Casra looked at him admiringly, as if to wonder how such a good heart could be sent to such a miserable place. But thi remembered that all people have a dark side, including herself. -->

<!-- "Smuggling is a lucrative trade. If you have a big enough buyer, then you can make anything happen."

"Who would need kanosin that much?"

"That's what I intend to find out." -->

<!-- left off -->

<!-- kanosin as ulukoma's export -->
<!--
"Kanosin is the only thing we can trade with the smugglers for food or tools but we used to share what we earned equally amongst ourselves."

"You were a kanosin refiner?" Kipnu flipped his tone. "Did you forget the oath we swore as physicians? 'Ability over Apathy'?"

"I didn't forget it!" thi snapped at him. "I've spent my life for the benefit of others!"

"How can you say that and still make the most addictive drug this world has ever seen?"

<!-- Backstory behind Shinna -->
<!--
"And then Shinna arrived. Many who fought so hard to break their addiction were seduced by the concept of antikan as a way to 'cheat' on their sobriety, but they never saw a drop. Others just wanted to feel superior over everyone else. Shinna made many empty promises and built an empire on the backs of their labor. Setre never gave up fighting for me and our tribe, grew impatient with my insistence on a peaceful resolution. She was right, of course, and at the end of it she forced me to leave to keep Linyu safe. I promised Setre I would return one day when Linyu was old enough, and I made her swear to me that she would keep the council alive. That day was yesterday. But when Linyu told me thi saw her in the forest, holding you down and taking you away, I knew it was over."

"Why did you come back?" asked Kipnu. "Why would you risk the life of you and your child to be in a place like this?"

"I'm not a child!" said Linyu, getting up from hae chair. Casra took hae hand to calm hae. -->
