## Chapter 10

A hand fell upon Kipnu's back and stayed there - intentional, not accidental. He removed his hands from his ears and listened to the chaos around him. He turned toward the hand.

"Hold still," a voice called from behind the hand. He could almost place the maman it came from. Thi grasped his arm firmly and pricked him with a needle. It jerked away as a reflex, and the maman let it go.

"Trust me," thi said, and he steadied his hand for hae. Thi had the hand of a doctor, adept and confident, and the injection flowed smoothly into his veins. With each wash of his blood through his body, the headache subsided and his eyesight returned, and he saw the maman clearly. Thi had the same kelp clothing as the others and a mask around hae mouth made of thin woven vines.

Thi stood up and looked at the crowd so as not to rouse suspicion.

"Stay low and walk ahead of me," thi said and held hae hand out slightly for him to take it. He had no reason to trust this maman but was desperate for a way out, so he took hae hand and walked slowly and quietly out from the crowd. When they got well enough away, the maman bent down to him and whispered, "Keep running toward Ulu. Stop on the far side of the valley, under the fallen tree. Run!", pushing Kipnu out of the pavilion. He looked back for a second and saw nothing but a closed flap of black cloth. Naked and hungry, he made a break for some fallen tree he had never seen before in the darkest part of the island.

_I've escaped! But surely they'll be after me soon._

He found that his eyes had adjusted to the darkness, but it was still quite difficult to look for fallen trees in such a dense forest. He made a point to use his ears, to listen for a breeze flowing freely at the top of a hill or whistling across the decaying bark of a fallen tree. Maybe that's how Setre found him, he thought.

He came across another tree with a coil set into its trunk. This time, the coil was polished and covered in sap, presumably from the tree it was attached do. _That veiled maman must have put these around. Who is thi?_ He wanted to stop to observe, but he forced himself to continue onward. Only a few steps, and he quickly found himself facing a giant obstacle. He followed it left and right, and made out the shape of a giant fallen tree thrusting its behemoth roots toward the sky, and he knew he'd come to his destination. Against the roots, he rested himself and gazed into the darkness from where he had fled.

"Damn this cold," He whispered to himself. He curled up into himself, his body shivering from exposure, but it was only temporary relief. He tried retracing the events of last night in his head. He remembered Setre injecting something into him, and a feeling of panicked euphoria. A knot grew in his stomach. _All my dreams... Did I want it? No, what am I saying..._

A different kind of headache had set in, and he pushed on his eyes to ease the pain. Liffa came into his imagination - strapped into a train without rails, flying beyond the edge of the sky. He wondered if thi was being treated well, if Fajro really was using hae life to bargain with the senate. Maybe Melna was doing better. She always remained cool and composed when the rest of the world teetered above a cliff of mindless panic. He loved that about her.

_Would they understand? Would they accept what I've done?_

_Maybe I do belong here..._

Behind him, Kipnu heard quiet and quick footsteps approaching. He quickly got up to his feet and ducked behind a tree, waiting for the footsteps to approach before he decided his next move.

"Kipnu," the maman quietly called him.

He could faintly see the silhouette of the one who had helped him. It was that same familiar voice of the veiled figure, but the veil had been removed and he recognized who it was.

"Casra?" He whispered to hae.

Kipnu was immeasurably relieved to see a familiar face, even if only an acquaintance.

"Kipnu, you've made it!" thi said. "Come now, under the fallen tree."

They walked no more than fifty paces before coming to the base of a massive tree with another copper coil on it. Casra cleared some leaves from the base and opened a wooden door that had just enough space to fit one person at a time, beckoning for Kipnu to follow hae down into the warmly-lit space below. He looked around and saw a home. A sort of cooking area to the left, a large bed at the far end, and a hand-made table in the center where Linyu was lighting a third lantern. He squatted down in reflex to cover himself, but Casra had already prepared him a set of kelp cloths and stood at the entrance helping him get into them. He found them quite warm â€“ warmer than he suspected.

"Lin, grab some paosin from the cupboard."

The kaln rose to fulfill hae mother's request and chimed, "Hi Kipnu. Thank you for saving me."

"Hey there..." he said as nicely as he could in the circumstances.

A wave of pain began to swell up again and he clutched his forehead and closed his eyes. Casra took a satchel from the kaln and dipped hae finger in it. "Here, rub some of this on your tongue. You'll feel some stinging at first, but it will subside."

He did as she told and immediately winced at a stinging sensation covering his tongue.

"It's doing its work," thi reassured him. Out of the corner of his eye, Kipnu could see Lin eying the shiny pendant around his neck. The stinging went away after a minute, along with the sharp pain in his head.

"It's gone. What was it?" he asked.

"Back at the pavilion, I gave you a bit of antikan to neutralize the kanosin in your blood. Paosin helps the symptoms of withdraw," Casra responded.

"I see," he said. The substances were familiar to him but he had never had the experience of taking them.

"I believe I have a great deal to explain to you. This is my kaln, Linyu. We arrived here with you yesterday, but we used to live here many ma'to before."

Linyu handed Kipnu a wooden bowl of some sort of fish stew, and he eagerly took it with gratitude and started eating.

In between spoonfuls, he asked, "Why have you come back to a place like this?"

"I spent three ma'to here at a dark time of my life. My journey began like most Ulukomai - a slave and a kanosin addict. The stuff was produced here by slave labor and then smugglers would bring it to the mainland. It's a vicious cycle that I got caught up in. Before I was an addict, I was a doctor - one of the best in Rudjan. I would often see kanosin addicts that had come directly from Ulukoma looking to escape their addiction and I developed my own treatment protocol that worked very well. In a stupidly brazen move, I decided to test it on myself to prove to my peers how effective it was, but I vastly underestimated its power and I was unable to pull out of it."

"You were the cause of your own suffering."

"Yes. My junds left me and I was sent here as punishment. This place used to be equitable. The clear-minded still held the power here, but they would try to uplift the addicted. Shinna changed all that, bastardized all of the traditions that kept this place livable for the addicted. Now death and addiction hang in this place."

"I noticed... a class hierarchy back at the pavilion."

"Shinna was a chemist in Shaki who somehow stumbled upon an antidote for Kanosin. Then thi came here with hae stockpile of antikan, and instead of giving it to us, thi used it as leverage to gain power over me. Now the upper class use it to get high at night and by morning they're back to normal."

"Wait, gain power over you? So you were a leader here?"

"Yes. One of three that formed a council of sorts. I was pushing for Ulukoma to become an independent province when I was ousted."

"How did you go from an addict to the leader of Ulukoma?"

"That's a long story," thi smiled and looked into hae mind, thinking of a better time.

"I like long stories," he said. "They get me invested."

Thi laughed, and paused to prepare haeself.

"I guess I'll start where I left off. You remember I mentioned traditions. One of the traditions we used to have was the evening. It used to be a time of storytelling, singing, confessing of love, public mediation. Anyone could stand up and say or do anything they wanted. Then some would group up and explore their sexualities together before sleep, and others would just sleep if they weren't ready. The evening was a place and time where people weaved their lives together and apart and together again, and everyone grew closer to each other because of it. I had been under the addiction, but I had the faculty to understand their words and feel the love of a tribe more deeply than I knew of my junds."

"On my first evening at Ulukoma, I had just met Setre, and she introduced me to the group, told them only the good things that I had told her about myself, and it was then that I knew: Ulukoma was not the lawless prison they said it was. About a ma'to after I arrived, Setre was pregnant and was convinced that I was the mother. At first I couldn't believe what she said, because I thought that kanosin led to impotence. But when I saw Linyu, saw hae eyes peer into mine, I felt... it. I felt motherhood. There it was right in front of me. And an immense feeling of shame washed over me. For who I had become, for how far I had fallen, for how my kaln might see me when thi grows up. There was only one option to me: I had to be the mother thi needed. So I begged Setre to let me raise hae, and we came to an agreement. There were many days when I felt the feverish hand of death upon me while I was in withdraw, but she watched over me, kept me hydrated, kept me sober. Until one day she stopped coming around, and I realized that I had already become that mother I was longing to be."

"Setre..." Kipnu said hesitantly, "She's a guardian now, right?"

"Yes... Linyu told me about what happened to you. She does what she must to maintain power among the guardians. Shinna pits them against each other for who can bring in more people."

"She sounds nothing like the person I met last night."

"I know this is hard to believe, but she is careful with her words, and she wouldn't harm anyone unless she thought they were a threat."

Kipnu was starting to have his doubts, but there were still more questions quavering about in his mind.

"So what did happen? How did you become the exiled leader of an island prison."

"I told you this was a long story," thi said with a smirk. "When I was in Rudjan, working with kanosin patients, I saw myself as just one of many doctors who were pursuing this goal. But after Ulukoma, my life's work became deeply personal and unique. I felt addiction, knew it deeply, like a relationship I wanted so badly to get out of but couldn't. And it was all around me in Ulukoma, affecting almost everyone I knew and had come to love. When I got sober, I could have just left this place - my sentence was long up. But these people were my family now, so for the next Ma'Tova I worked with each one of them to make it out of addiction. The ones that made it swore to me the lives I had given back to them, and learned my methods.

"And then Shinna arrived. Many who fought so hard to break their addiction were seduced by the concept of antikan as a way to 'cheat' on their sobriety, but they never saw a drop. Others just wanted to feel superior over everyone else. Shinna made many empty promises and built an empire on the backs of their labor. Setre never gave up fighting for me and our tribe, grew impatient with my insistence on a peaceful resolution. She was right, of course, and at the end of it she forced me to leave to keep Linyu safe. I promised Setre I would return one day when Linyu was old enough, and I made her swear to me that she would keep the council alive. That day was yesterday. But when Linyu told me thi saw her in the forest, holding you down and taking you away, I knew it was over."

"Why did you come back?" asked Kipnu. "Why would you risk the life of you and your child to be in a place like this?"

"I'm not a child!" said Linyu, getting up from hae chair. Casra took hae hand to calm hae.

"Our people are still here. Linyu's nather is still here. Every person that lived here had a bond to everyone else. Raising children, falling in love, building the village â€“ everything was done with tremendous trust in each other. We accepted our divisions, our arguments; by working through them we accomplished great things. I cannot simply go back to being a Rudjani doctor as if this island wasn't a part of me. I cannot abandon my people to a careless mogul. This is where I belong."

"You speak of them like they're your family."

Thi sighed and paused to think.

"Do you care about your junds, Kipnu?" thi asked.

He hesitated, now aware of the pendant around his neck.

"Yea," he said. "Of course."

"Would you ever abandon them?"

"No."

"This is the same feeling. It takes time."

He was silent, trying to find words to explain the disconnect in his mind, but the explanation eluded him.

Casra became curious. "Your junds," thi said. "Tell me about them."

"Liffa was... is... everything good in my life. To the rest of Heiko Liffa is just a farmer, but they don't see hae like I do. Liffa holds the three of us together, but there's this cloud that hangs above hae always. Sometimes I just can't figure hae out"

"And your woman?"

"Melna is... a fidelant."

"Why is that the first word you choose to describe her?"

"It's all she does lately. Half of her time is spent in Shaki. The other half is spent visiting people and getting their opinions, so I don't see her as often."

"Do you trust her?"

"Of course! We're bonded."

"Tell me something, Kipnu. Where are they right now?"

Kipnu was confused at the question.

"They are far from you," thi said, explaining hae conjecture. "Has something happened?"

"I fought for Liffa to stay, and I was sent here."

"And Melna didn't follow you."

"There are bigger things at stake than our joining."

"Then do you trust them to go on without you?"

"Out with it," he said, clearly agitated. "Go on, you want to say something, say it."

"The people who come here leave behind lives full of relationships. They invent new worries to keep themselves attached to the people they left behind. They think themselves irreplaceable, but then they return home to find that the world they left behind had been replaced. The grand personas they were building before had vanished, and some... just can't adjust. They placed their faith in the lives they knew, rather than the lives they were living.

"By deciding not to come here, Melna has decided to continue her own life on its own trajectory â€“ and all the better that she doesn't suffer for your rash decision. So what I'm asking is," and thi leaned forward to look closely into his eyes, "do you trust your junds to do what's best for themselves, even if it means leaving you behind?"

He was aghast at imagining what he was saying. "We're bonded," he stammered, "we do what's best for each other."

"A bond is something you say once, in a time of your life you hardly remember, with a feeling you'll never have again. Its meaning is nothing more than the inscriptions on your pendants. It's a gamble that you'll always be content with each other. If there really is something big at stake, then your lives are about to be thrown into disarray."

"What are you on about?"

He placed the bowl down and paced around angrily.

"Yes, all of us have been separated by distance, but this is all temporary. We'll go back home once things clear up and my sentence ends."

"Kipnu, a man like you doesn't get sent here for nothing. You throw one punch in your life, maybe two. And you mean it. This space thing, whatever it is made you worried for your maman's life. So you must know there's a chance thi doesn't come back. Just as there's a chance that you won't come back."

"No. No no."

He paced around the small area between the table and the entryway.

"I have to go. I have to find Liffa."

He walked to the entryway ladder and contemplated leaving. Casra didn't follow him, but spoke before he could place a hand on the ladder.

"Kipnu," she said his name to stop him. "You're a good man. I know you don't really belong in Ulukoma. But right now, leaving isn't possible. Everyone on this island is looking for you. You could steal a boat, but the waters between here and the mainland are patrolled by bounty hunters just looking for reason to kill. We need to make the most of where we are."

"And what, hide here forever? No. I have to leave now," he placed a foot on the ladder and continued his momentum upward. Thi sighed and got up to follow him outside with Linyu close behind.

Kipnu kept shaking his head, unwilling to accept what had happened. This was all just some minor excursion. Shinna and Setre were just dreams. From the Kanosin. He wasn't really a fugitive. Right?

"Kipnu," said Casra. "What's on your mind?"

"I just want to sit and think for a while."

"I've done enough talking, I suppose it's natural to want to digest it all."

Thi turned to go back inside, but he interjected, "Wait...can you stay...in case some guardians or whatever show up?"

Thi looked amused, but humored him. "Okay then. I'll wait with you."

He sat awkwardly, replaying the events of the previous night, repeating what Casra said in his mind. He imagined different scenarios to convince fate to change its mind, but found nothing. Distracted, he noticed the two pairs of eyes peering at him the whole time.

"I can't think with you staring at me," he said.

"Sorry," Casra explained, "I didn't want a guardian to come whisk you away when I wasn't looking."

"Very funny."

Thi paused, thinking, and then said, "I have something to show you."

"I'm not in the mood to see anything."

"It'll just be a moment," thi said, already getting up. Linyu, sensing what his mother was doing, ran in front of hae. Together, they cleared the ground underneath a modestly-sized tree, and inspected a coil that had been affixed to it. Linyu produced two wooden contraptions from hae pocket, handing one to Casra and the other too Kipnu. His eyes were drawn to this curiosity that Linyu held in front of him and he took it reluctantly. There was a ring of coiled copper with smaller beads around it and a larger cylindrical metal bead in the middle. They were all fastened to a small wooden plate that was smaller than his hand, carved from the trunk of a tree.

"This is my newest one. Don't break it," thi said. He nodded in confirmation, not sure if he knew how not to break it.

Casra began, "Setre told me once that they have these coils on some of the trees in Holrag. She wanted me to figure out what they're for."

"What does this have to do with anything?" he asked.

Thi ignored his question and continued.

"Linyu tried different size coils and attached different things to the ends of it until one time it vibrated ever so slightly. Like there was some voice speaking to us."

"A message? Come on, it's a tree."

"This tree is a sort of... conduit. It sends and receives messages encoded in the air. Who sends them? I don't know. But my guess is on the Holragi."

"So the Holragi can talk to each other through trees? You realize how ridiculous that sounds?"

"This is why you must listen," said Casra. Linyu lifted the wooden instrument to his ear, and at first he heard nothing.

"Silent, right?" thi said. "Listen closer."

He focused his mind and listened closer to the faint static that entered his ear and a pulsing, rhythmic pattern began to emerge. It had the sound of a man's voice within it, in a tone like nothing he had ever heard before.

"A voice" he exclaimed. His mind had turned in an instant. "But the words. They're unintelligible."

"Those signals are new, coming from a place far, far away," thi explained. "Normally we couldn't hear them on account of the trees making all sorts of noise. But they've gone silent as of late."

Thi turned toward the coil with a piece of metal in hae hand and spoke into it, "But if the speaker is near, they can be heard as though they were standing right next to you," and like a ghost in his own mind, hae voice pierced the noise and entered his head in its muffled timbre. The sound echoed and reverberated off of some unseen pattern of walls in the ether.

Kipnu was confused. "How?" He asked, "I don't understand."

"I was confused too, at first," said Casra. "Imagine that we live on different sides of an unsurmountable wall. We can't see or hear each other, but I know you exist, and you know I exist. We could talk by throwing rocks with messages carved in them, or we could carve a hole in the wall and speak through that. But what if, instead, you put your ear to the wall while I knocked on it from the other side. And now imagine that I had a machine - something that knocks so quickly that it sounds like a person's voice. Now imagine you wanted to tell a hundred people something. Would you rather throw a hundred rocks, or tell them to listen to the wall?"

"So... those coils... they're the machines you were talking about?"

"The trees are the machinery. The coils and the metal beads merely carry our voices."

"And the wall is...?"

"All of the universe. The darkness, the light; the soil beneath us, and the sky above us. This invisible wall permeates everything. If someone knocks, you need only put your ear to it. The wind speaks, as we say."

"Ahh I see," he said, not quite understanding. "I'm impressed, honestly I am, but why did you want to show me this?"

"When I was a councilmaman here, and people made the decision to leave the tribe and return to their lives on the mainland, I would give them a listener and every night I gave them an update on life in Ulukoma. For me, it was a way to let them know that they would always have a home under Ulu."

Thi took his hand and spoke to him earnestly.

"There are many dangers in this place, Kipnu. And we may get separated at some point. Linyu and I made a home from this hole in the ground long ago, and this listener is how we kept track of each other and warned each other of danger. It was our lifeline to each other, and now we are inviting you to join us."

Kipnu was feeling tense at her words. He looked at Linyu for some sign that things were not as dangerous as hae mother was saying, but thi also had a serious look.

"Look, I know to stay away from guardians. I can handle myself in a fight. I don't mean to disappoint you but I'm planning to leave as soon as I can."

"Linyu told me about what happened in the forest. Setre captured you only paces away from the treeline?"

He flushed with frustration, "I was thoroughly into those woods."

Linyu smirked, knowing exactly how many paces he had gone.

"Maybe you're on your way out. Maybe you'll be gone by the end of the day," said Casra. "Either way, take this with you. Maybe you'll hear us and remember us when you're back at home."

He fumbled for some response, then acknowledged that he had been rash to dismiss hae offer.

Sensing his turnaround, thi held up the device and asked, "May I?"

"Sure," he said, bending his ear toward hae to fasten it. The metal of the coil was cold to his ear, but it quickly turned warm with the heat of his head.

Thi took his empty bowl and placed it in a basin, pushing hard on an adjacent lever to produce water. He wondered where that water came from, but his mind could no longer bear a word of new knowledge. A sleepy look appeard on Linyu's eyes, an he acknowledged it in himself as well.

Casra, without looking, said, "You two should get some rest. I'll keep watch."

Linyu got up and walked toward the bed.

"The floor is good," he said to himself, settling into a space underneath the table.

Linyu fetched him a pillow, filled with what he presumed was old dried leaves. To his surprise, it was comfortable, and the ground was warmer than it should have been in such a cold place. He settled into his spot, felt a great weight folding over his eyehaw, and listened as the sounds of Casra's movements settled near Linyu. Casra's voice mulled over the walls in a soft hum, painted them with the words that lay behind them. Words that Linyu already knew. Words that Kipnu didn't need to.
