A hand fell upon Kip's back - intentionally, not accidentally. He looked up to see his surroundings again and noticed that everyone had gone while he wasn't paying attention.

"The worst is over," said Casra.

"Casra? Casra! You made it!"

Kip was ecstatic to hear a familiar voice, even if only an acquaintance. He turned around to see her and the child standing behind him dressed in woven reeds as the others had been dressed. She was holding a folded set of clothing for him.

"You're one of them?" he asked, clearly apprehensive.

She took a step toward him, trying to give him the reed cloth, but he backed away.

"Kipnu... I think I have a lot to explain."

"Why did everyone leave? What's going on?"

"Please, give me some time to explain," Casra pleaded to him while taking another step forward. He took the clothing apprehensively, and began to dress himself.

She said, "I bid for you and I won. You are now part of my tribe."

"I would thank you but I don't know you well enough to know if that's a good or bad thing."

"This is my kaln, Linyi. We were sent here together yesterday, on your boat, but we used to live here for many ma'to before."

"So when Linyi was saying that hae mother lives here..."

"Thi was talking about me, yes."

"Why did you come back to a place like this?"

"I spent three ma'to here. I started like most people here - a slave and a kanosin addict. The stuff is made here so it's very easy to get. I worked the darkness and resigned myself to the addiction. When my wife Pokyi was sent here, pregnant with our child, I was changed. There was only one choice for me: the choice to be a mother. I wish I could say that I never had second thoughts, but addiction has a way of demonizing parts of your mind."

"Many mothers choose Kanosin. You did the right thing."

"Thank you for thinking so."

"You still haven't answered my question. Why did you come back?"

"Well, before I was a Kanosin addict, I was a doctor - one of the best in Shaki harbor. I would often see addicts that had come directly from Ulu looking to escape their addiction and I developed my own treatment protocol that worked really well. When I found myself sober in Ulu, I decided I would do the same for those in my tribe. It worked so well that I was able to create a tribe of my own, full of ex-addicts that owed me their lives."

"You grew your power here through medicine."

"More than I could ever have found under Ara."

"Then I guess I should ask why you left."

"I was deposed... Lissa's tribe became dominant through manipulation. You saw firsthand what thi will do to get hae way. Lissa became possessive of some of my men and women and turned them against me. Setre argued on my behalf but I knew that it was best for me to leave."

"What became of your tribe?"

"I promised them I would return one day, and they continued on without me. I taught them everything I knew, and they continued the tradition. When I came back to them last night, they were as strong as I had left them."

""



because there's something here that kept bugging me back on the mainland."

"What is that?"

"Here in the shadestead, we hunt gigantic birds of prey for food and tools. Nearly all of the ones we find are wounded or elderly."

"So where do they come from?"

"Exactly."
