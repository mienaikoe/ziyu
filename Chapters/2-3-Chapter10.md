<!--

this chapter gets really confusing:
- Casra: Wanted to remain secretive.
  - Does not bargain with Lissa, as Lissa would just enslave hae.
  - Might bargain with Setre, if Setre is an old flame.
- Setre: Wants to maintain her post
  - Captures Kip for slavery
    - May or may not be a ploy to save him
      - An alternate fate would have been Kip getting lost and dying in the forest
      - Or being enslaved by some other tribe where Setre couldn't help him.
      - Or being eaten by the birds
        - Would have to write in some reference to giant silhouettes in the sky.
  - Does not capture Casra or Linyu
    - Setre is secretly playing for Casra's new team.
      - Why doesn't Setre just take him somewhere else then? Why is the shadestead important?
    - Setre doesn't know Casra is back
      - Her dialog in ch8 says otherwise
        - Change the dialog to not include Linyu or Casra. Setre will run after Kip and Cas and then will have to make a judgment call whether to protect them or herself. Decides to protect them by pretending she didn't see them
        - Okay done.

## CHapter 10


A hand fell upon Kip's back and stayed there - intentional, not accidental. He looked up to see the chaos ahead of him, and turned to find the person behind. It was a maman with the same reed clothing and a veil of dark green. Thi was looking at the crowd so as not to rouse suspicion.

"Stay low and walk ahead of me," thi said. He could almost place the voice. Thi paused for Kip, holding hae hand out slightly for him to take it. He had no reason to trust this phantom but was desperate for a way out, so he took hae hand and walked as slowly and quietly as he could. When they got behind Lissa, the veiled figure bent down to him and whispered, "Towards Ulu. Stop under the fallen tree. Run!", pushing Kip out of the tent. He looked back for a second and saw nothing but the door to the tent closed. Stark naked, and severely malnourished, he made a break for some fallen tree he had never seen before in the darkest part of the island.

*I've escaped! But surely they'll be after me soon.*

The forest was darker here, but he found that somehow he could see better than yesterday. Perhaps it was the light from the blue line he had been marked with, or his eyes adjusting to an eternal nighttime. It was still quite difficult to look for fallen trees in a forest of gigantic trees that block a great deal of view in any direction. He made a point to listen more intently for places where the light breeze would whistle across the bark. Maybe a fallen tree would likely sound a bit different, he thought.

He came across another tree with a coil around its base. This time, the coil was polished and covered in sap, presumably from the tree it was wrapped around, and the ends were almost touching. *The veiled person must have put these around. Who is thi?*

Behind him, Kip heard quiet and quick footsteps approaching. He ducked behind a tree and waited for the footsteps to approach before he decided his next move.

"Kipnu," thi called. Kip could faintly see the figure of the one who approached him. He looked closer at hae and finally realized who it was.

"Casra! Is that you?"

Kip was ecstatic to see a familiar face, even if only an acquaintance.

"Kipnu. Oh thank Ara. Let's get to my safehouse under the fallen tree."

"Lead the way."

They walked no more than 50 paces before coming to the base of a massive tree that had been uprooted almost a la'to ago. Casra cleared some leaves from the base and opened a wooden door that had just enough space to fit one person at a time. Casra descended into the dimly-lit depths below and beckoned Kip to follow hae. Once inside, Kip could see a small lantern being lit by a small maman. He covered himself, remembering he was still naked. Casra had already prepared him a set of reed cloths and shoved them toward him the moment he set foot on the ground.

"Linyu, would you fix our guest a bowl?"

"Hi Kipnu!"

"Hey... So when you were saying that your mother lives here â€“"

"I was protecting her identity."

Kip nodded, apprehensive, but glad he finally understood what was going on.

Casra started, "Kipnu, I believe I have a lot to explain. This is my kaln, Linyu. We were sent here together yesterday, on your boat, but we used to live here for many ma'to before."

Linyu handed Kip a bowl of some sort of fish stew, and he eagerly took it and started eating without pause.

In between spoonfuls, he asked, "Why did you come back to a place like this?"

"I spent three ma'to here. I started like most people here - a slave and a kanosin addict. The stuff is made here so it's very easy to get. I worked the darkness and resigned myself to the addiction. When my wife Pokyi was sent here, pregnant with our child, I was changed. There was only one choice for me: the choice to be a mother. I wish I could say that I never had second thoughts, but addiction has a way of demonizing parts of your mind."

"Many mothers choose Kanosin. You did the right thing."

"Thank you for thinking so."

"You still haven't answered my question. Why did you come back?"

"Well, before I was a Kanosin addict, I was a doctor - one of the best in Shaki harbor. I would often see addicts that had come directly from Ulu looking to escape their addiction and I developed my own treatment protocol that worked really well. When I found myself sober in Ulu, I decided I would do the same for those in my tribe. It worked so well that I was able to create a tribe of my own, full of ex-addicts that owed me their lives."

"You grew your power here through medicine."

"More than I could ever have found under Ara. But, I was deposed... Lissa's tribe became dominant through manipulation. You saw firsthand what thi will do to get hae way. Lissa became possessive of some of my men and women and turned them against me. Setre fought on my behalf but I knew that it was best for me to leave."

"Setre? Thi was with you?"

"Yes. Before I left, we were... close. Very close... But she was frustrated that I wouldn't do anything to stop Lissa. That I had been too weak on hae. I promised her I would return one day. I taught her everything I knew, hoping she would keep the tradition. When I heard from Linyu that she had Lissa's markings and had captured you, I knew that the tribe had disbanded."

"So everything you came back for is gone."

"There's something else. I'm sure you saw the big coil around the tree you were hiding behind."

"It's hard to miss."

"Those coils are picking up some sort of signal in the tree. I don't know what it is, but you can clearly hear a pattern. I think it has something to do with the Shayadj."

"The what?"

"Back in the shadestead, we used to hunt giant birds that we named Shayadj for food and bone tools. Nearly all of the ones we found are wounded."

"So where do they come from?"

"Exactly."
