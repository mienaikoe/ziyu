"The worst is over," said Casra.

"Casra? Casra! You made it!"

Kip was ecstatic to hear a familiar voice, even if only an acquaintance. He turned around to see her and the child standing behind him dressed as the others had been dressed.

"You're one of them?" he asked, clearly apprehensive.

"Kipnu... I think I have a lot to explain."

"Why did everyone leave? What's going on?"

"Kip, just give me a second," Casra pleaded to him while taking a step forward. He backed away from her. His mistrust of the people here had already been burned into his instincts.

"Who are you really?" he asked.

"This is my kaln, Linyi. We were sent here together yesterday, on your boat, but we used to live here for ma'to before."

"So when Linyi was saying that his mother lives here..."

"He was talking about me, yes."
