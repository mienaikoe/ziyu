## Chapter 25

Rocks. Everywhere. I would never have believed that something so simple could haunt me as much as the rocks did on the path to Ara. Everywhere we walked, our journey was punctuated with sharp edges and unstable footing. We could barely see them but for the faintly ambient glow of Ara bouncing through the neverending cloud of dust, and a small anomin oil lantern that Pomri had to continuously wipe clean. I was glad of her foresight.

"All these tracks are headed toward Rudjan," she said, observing carefully. "The children who couldn't swim that distance. They would have been captured by now – never had a chance."

I imagined myself part of that swarm of children, running for our lives as rocks and ash came tumbling down from the sky and the ground, and then a regiment of Rudjani soldiers comes to scoop us up. Would we be sold into slavery to work in the desert?

"Bavle said you were a traitor," I began. "Why did you choose to fight for Heiko?"

An anxious pause suspended her mind.

"They turned their backs on me. So I did the same."

"What did you do?"

Another pause held her.

"I killed a maman."

Suddenly I saw Pomri in the light of danger. I tried to imagine her killing someone and failed. But somehow the way she said it was believable. In a subtle way, too subtle for me to be aware, my muscles began to tense.

Pomri explained, "A merchant. Thi wasn't a criminal by the word of the law, but thi knew how to use peoples' consciousness against each other. Thi sowed seeds of hatred amongst the merchant guild to harvest them for her own personal gain, and quickly became the most wealthy trader in Rudjan by far. The government recognized what was happening, but refused to do anything about it. They were probably getting a cut too, petty cowards."

She paused to lift her mask and take a drink.

"At the time I was one of five commanders of the army, the only one to openly speak out against hae. I decided to take things into my own hands. In the dark of the night, I pretended to do a customs check of hae ship. I planted paosin below deck and arrested hae under suspicion of smugglng."

"But that's unlawful," I objected.

"Sometimes the law isn't enough to protect us. Anyway, the magistrate investigating hae shipment ledger found no evidence of smuggling and decided to exile us both. I knew the only justice that would come for hae was my own, so I triple-dosed hae with paosin patches while thi was shackled on the ship to Ulukoma. I went to Heiko and never looked back."

"How do you know thi's dead?"

"I guess I don't."

"Do you regret it?"

"No. Thi was a menace to Rudjan. Our city would be reduced to a corporate puppet if we let hae continue."

Her story didn't sit well with me, but perhaps I knew inside that something of the sort was in her past. I wondered if Melna knew this story. Perhaps Pomri was comfortable telling it now that the law had become meaningless.

She quickly changed the subject.

"When the road ends, we turn and continue toward Ulu."

"End? Wouldn't the road end in..."

But the obvious answer came to me. I had imagined it as an explosion, a big fireball followed by a massive plume of smoke. But this was a giant chunk of metal, a spear the size of a ship, and it was falling – straight down, from far above the sky. I imagined its speed: faster than a train or a saffa, faster than I've ever seen anything move. I imagined it boring through the center of Palinan and coming out the other side. _It couldn't do that... right?_

"Pomri..?"

She glanced at me, hearing my curiosity.

"What exactly happened to Heiko?" I asked, anxiously.

She looked at me again, this time she held her stare.

"A damn metal ball hit it. Why do you ask such questions?"

"I meant... after..."

"You'll find out soon enough. Best not to dwell on thoughts like that."

"Maybe we can find survivors quicker if we can figure out what areas were hit the hardest."

She turned to stop me with a palm on my arm, clearly agitated, not annoyed.

"Look around, Linyu. You think someone could survive this chaotic mess?"

She lifted her hands and turned back toward the darkness.

"We're here for confirmation. To pay our respects and provide closure for the people who left loved ones behind. Nothing more."

I wanted to cry, but I had come to despise the wastefulness of tears.

We followed the crater edge toward the harbor, making a note of its size by tracking our paces from the long road to the Ulu road. The immensity of the crater was unsettling. If not for the dust, an absence the size of a city may have paralyzed me. But Pomri kept me going. And I wondered what kept her.

This place seemed so alien to me, even though I had been there just a day before. I struggled to understand even the minute parts of it: why were the rocks so jagged and the dust so incessant? were there others like Jesse, living only to die slowly? But I knew that if I asked she would say _"Oi, kaln. Now is not the time."_. So I did what my mother taught me to do once. I closed my eyes and saw myself through the dust from above, weaving perception together with inference to hold all of Heiko in my awareness. I saw it as I understood it – in the absence of sight, I could paint the image of my world on my mind. I saw a deep hole; as deep as the tallest tree is tall. A sword falling from the sky, turning the earth into dust, pushing it out in every direction. It was the concrete of their homes, the boulders upon which they built, cracked and heated and pulverized into trillions of rocks and pebbles and specks of dust. We were but a ship of the living making our way across an ocean of the dead.

"She's in there somewhere. I have to find her."

I snapped my eyes up and saw Pomri's lantern-lit face. The sound of waves and an odd rushing of water filled the air behind her, and I saw the crater bowing its proud lip into the ocean, having erased any memory of the harbor that came before it. save for a few jagged, broken posts. The dust was thinner here, as I assumed that the ocean was acting as a sponge, but a giant cloud of smoke stood directly between us and Ara, shortening our visibility to less than a Lao'ta.

She had stopped halfway through a stride, holding her lantern up to her face.

"Ay. Damn this thing." The flame began to flicker and fade. "Never enough fuel."

I moved closer to her, suddenly aware of my dependence on her light. She glanced back at me as if she was surprised, expressionless. I barely saw her face before the lantern fizzled out and we were stuck in the muddy twilight, unable to see where the path ended and where it began.

"I am not wasting my life because of a damn lantern," she said, setting it down harshly. I could tell she wanted to toss it into the crater, but she settled for staring at it in angry deliberation. My own deliberations were fixated on a few glass ampules and a syringe in a small writers bag in my satchel. I wasn't sure if this was the best use for them or what Pomri would think, but somehow I found the bag in my hands anyway holding them out for Pomri to feel for.

"What is this?"

"Kanosin."

"Oi put that away! What would you bring something like that out here for?"

"It can light the way."

"What are you on about now?"

She watched patiently as I pulled the ampules out and neatly injected one into the hydroderm on my left shin. From the point of the syringe the kanosin glowed and permeated the vasculature, filling every water capillary in my entire lower leg with a bright flow tattoo. I did the same to my other leg. By the time I finished the entire ground around us was pale blue and I could see Pomri's face in the illumination, wide-eyed and unbelieving.

"W... What is this?"

"My people live in darkness. We had to find some way to see light."

"So you used Kanosin?"

"It has many uses."

"And Fajro used it to enslave the tribes of Holrag."

"But, Fajro has never been to Ulukoma."

"He didn't need to."

She eyed one of the ampules in my hand. I held it in my hand with much deliberation, gesturing for her to take it – an offer to which she obliged, holding it up to her eye to look at closer. The outline of her face was widened through the translucent inactivated liquid, and I giggled internally.

"What is Kanosin?" she asked me.

I hesitated, remembering my mother's strict instruction not to tell anyone the truth about Kanosin. But I felt that I could trust Pomri.

"It's a compound. From kelp."

"Yes but... what does it actually do?"

"It..."

"Go on."

"It reverses death."

Pomri paused, doubtful. "Kanosin... makes you immortal?"

"Not exactly."

"And you use it as a flow tattoo?"

"We had no other light. How else would we continue?"

She held her head in disbelief. "You could save countless lives with this. Why aren't you sharing it with the world?"

"This world can't be saved. The obscura was a convenient distraction for Holrag. Now they control everything."

She grasped my arm, trying eagerly to be convincing, "Who are you to judge the future of the world? There are people in Rudjan who despise the Holragi. People that could be saved from the obscura."

"They can't! They can't be saved!" I plead.

"Why not?!"

My face flushed with frustration. I had learned of the dark side of this world from my parents and all the stories told by the forgotten people of Ulukoma.

I said, desparately, "The old tribes of Ulukoma discussed this long ago and we reached a conclusion. My mother's research on Kanosin is far too dangerous to spread beyond Ulukoma."

"Your tribes cannot be the gatekeeper of life and death."

"We must," I said. "If more people discover what we know, the Holragi will get wind of it and invade. They will take everything we have including the land we live on. Then they will be the gatekeepers."

With great anxiety I stood up, sinching my satchel closed while Pomri sat stewing in rage. I didn't have the strength to look in her eye. Instead, a strong urge to get away from Pomri was growing, deep within a pool of guilt. And so I left the vials, the syringe, and began to walk.

"Where are you going Linyu?"

"Back to Laen-Laen"

"We aren't done here."

I didn't respond.

"Just like that? You're going to walk away like you never knew me?"

Her voice started to break.

"You could have saved Kipnu! You could have saved Melna!"

"You're no better than the Holragi!"

A boulder appeared a few paces ahead, big enough to sit and hide behind, and I nearly ran to it in panic. Such words could be taken easily from a stranger, but not from a friend. I opened my hands and looked at the empty ampules. I had found them so often as toddler in Rudjan. My mother was too absent for even her best intentions to manifest. Kanosin had become an enemy. But when I met my nather, I was in awe at the brightly colored flow tattoos on her chest. She told me stories of fetching drowned fishers from the darkest waters, lit only by the light from her skin. She brought their bodies to my mother who cleared the water from their airways and recalled them back to life with kanosin. Eventually, I would have dismissed the stories as hyperbolic, but experience has only reinforced them for me. _Kanosin is a beast, not a demon,_ I recalled one of my mother's sayings. _We must tame it, not destroy it._ I looked down at the bright streaks of kanosin on my legs, so alike to the patterns of my nather's skin, and I felt no shame.

Curiosity turned my eyes backward, where I saw her stumbling in the dark down the crater toward the last remnants of the harbor. Very faintly, I saw a blue light radiating from her left foot and left arm.

"There's nothing left," I said to myself. But I had to follow her to make sure she was safe.

She made a turn toward the water, bounding down the outside of the crater as if to notice something specific. Her steps were deliberate, painfully blind. But with great patience, she made it down to the waterline all the same, me observing from above.

Pomri stepped into the frigid water and waded out until covered her legs and wetted her waist. Ahead of her, the stub of a wooden column pointed toward the sky where the pier used to be, its proud top severed and washed away. Alone it stood as the last of its kind. She let her hands and head rest softly against its side, and spoke to an old friend she'd lost too soon.
