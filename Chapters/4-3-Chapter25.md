  Annui flees to Rudjan?

  The chapter starts at the edge of Heiko ruins: a massive crater of rubble.

## Chapter 25

The ground was punctuated with innumerable rocks, both sharply-pointed and still quite warm. We could barely see them but for the barely ambient glow of Ara on dust, and a lantern that Pomri had to continuously wipe clean. I was glad of her foresight.

"All these tracks are headed toward Rudjan," she said, observing carefully. "Would have been the children who couldn't swim that distance. They would have been captured by the blockade by now – never had a chance."

I imagined myself part of that swarm of children, running for our lives as rocks and ash came tumbling down from the sky and the ground, and then a regiment of Rudjanese soldiers comes to scoop us up. Would we be sold into slavery to work in the desert? Or killed on the spot? I decided not to answer that question right now.

"How will we know when we get to the harbor?" I asked.

"When the road ends, we turn and continue toward Ulu."

"End? Why would the..."

But the obvious answer came to me. I had imagined it as an explosion, a big fireball followed by a massive plume of smoke. But this was a giant chunk of metal, a spear the size of a boat, and it was falling – straight down, from far above the sky. I imagined its speed: faster than a train or a saffa, faster than I've ever seen anything move. I imagined it boring through the center of Palinan and coming out the other side. *It couldn't do that... right?*

"Pomri..?"

She glanced at me, hearing my curiosity.

"What exactly happened to Heiko?" I asked, anxiously.

She looked at me again, this time she held her stare.

"Why do you ask such questions?"

I had an answer but she wasn't looking for one.

"You'll find out soon enough. Best not to dwell on thoughts like that. Focus on the task at hand."

"Maybe we can find survivors quicker if we can figure out what areas were hit the hardest."

She turned to stop me, putting her hand on my shoulder.

"Look around, Linyu! You think someone could survive this chaotic mess?"

She lifted her hands and turned back toward the darkness.

"We're here for confirmation. For our own closure. Nothing more."

I wanted to cry, but got angry instead and took off walking in front of her. My tears were not for her to see.

Ahead and above in the distance, I heard the cries of a man, interspersed with fits of coughing – an even split of the two. At first I thought my ears betrayed me, but as we approached, the sound grew in volume. I traced it to a direction nearer Ara and took off. Pomri was behind me screaming "Wait!" but I did not stop.

The ground began to absolutely teem with rocks as it sloped upward. *This hill wasn't here before. Heiko is a flat grassland.* I reached a point where the rocks continued but the land leveled off again. A few paces away, I saw him through the dust. He knealt with his hands behind his head, nodding his torso back and forth. I came to him, yelling, "Aey-o. you alright?" but suddenly a rock below me gave way, and I stumbled. My reflexes lurched my hands towards the closest rocks, scraping them as they clambered for a solid grasp. Below me was a sudden drop and a black void. Its depth was unknowable, but I knew I would certainly die if I let go now.

"Got you," she said, grasping my wrist. "What are you thinking running off in the dark like that?"

My breath and my words were paused in shock as she pulled me back onto the clifftop.

"We've reached the crater. Try your best not to fall into it again."

As I caught my breath, I shushed Pomri to listen for the sounds of the man that led me here. Still he was crying, close to us yet unaware of me or Pomri.

"Who's there?" she asked harshly. But he didn't respond. She approached the sound carefully.

"Speak!" she tried being demanding, but still he didn't respond.

She laid a hand on his shoulder and he panicked, stumbling on himself and wheezing heavily as he backed away. His eyes were bloodshot, and his face caked with black ash.

"I have nothing to give you," he said staring at her feet. "Take my life or leave me to my grief," he said.

"Jesse? Is that you?"

He remained there, motionless, fighting back a cough and holding his hand to the back of his head.

"How did you survive?"

But still he did not move.

"He can't hear you," I chimed.

Pomri glanced back at me, apprehensive. Instead of fighting with her, I approached him slowly and held out my hand, to which he responded with his own. Upon his palm, I placed a finger and drew the words I wanted to say. *L-I-N-Y-U*, first, and then pointed to myself. Then *P-O-M-R-I*. His eyes lit up ever so slightly as if he knew that name, but he didn't look in her direction, only at me.

"I know Pomri. She warned us early. Got most of us out."

It occured to me that he may not yet have realized that he had gone deaf and partially blind.

"Ask him what happened," Pomri asked.

*W-H-A-T-H-A-P-P-*, he paused me, signaling that he understood.

"I was at the observatory when Holragi landed. Thimlu had a message he wanted to send. I was hoping to bring it with me wherever you were going, but I was too late... But that's okay, because now you're here."

"That's great, Jesse," said Pomri, "What was the message?"

*W-H-A-*

"...I...I can't remember."

"You can't remember?"

She stooped down and shook his hand eagerly.

"Try to remember," she said.

"Why can't I remember?! Wait... who are you? I have nothing to give you. Stay away!"

He turned around to run away from us and it was then that I noticed a large bruise on the back of his head that he had been covering with his hand. With a fit, he coughed loudly as if he had been holding it in. Black mucus appeared on his hand.

"Leave me be," he said to us.

We stood there for a while, letting go of him and his fate. Then Pomri interjected, "Let's go," and took off toward Ara while I stayed in toe. Before the dust swallowed him, I looked back at his ashen face, and internalized the broken person that I saw there. And I promised myself never to forget.

********

We followed the crater edge toward the harbor, making a note of its size by tracking our paces from long road to Ulu road. Its immensity was unsettling. If not for the dust, the realization of an insuperable absence the size of Heiko Center may have paralyzed me the way it had Jesse. But Pomri kept me going. And I wondered what kept her.

An excessive amount of questions filled my mind. This place was so alien to me, I struggled to understand even the minute parts of it. Why were the rocks so jagged and the dust so incessant? Were there others like Jesse, living only to die slowly? But I knew she would say *"Oi, kaln. Stop asking questions"*. So I kept my mouth shut and removed the curiosity from my mind.

I was first to hear the shoreline, and an odd rushing of water that I hadn't heard before.

"We're close to the shore. But there's also... some strange rushing sound. Like a river. Do you hear that?"

She paused to listen closer and heard nothing, so she signalled for me to lead the way. I stood next to her, following my ears to the source until she could hear it too, then we both hurried to find a broad, broken channel of ocean ripping through rock and into the crater.

"The harbor is on the other side," she said, "We can't cross through, it's too dangerous."

She closed her eyes, imagining what this singular thing might mean for everything else.

"There must be dozens of these all along the shore."
