## Chapter 25

The ground was punctuated with innumerable rocks, both sharply-pointed and still quite warm. We could barely see them but for the barely ambient glow of Ara on dust, and a lantern that Pomri had to continuously wipe clean. I was glad of her foresight.

"All these tracks are headed toward Rudjan," she said, observing carefully. "Would have been the children who couldn't swim that distance. They would have been captured by the blockade by now â€“ never had a chance."

I imagined myself part of that swarm of children, running for our lives, only to be scooped up by a regiment of Rudjanese soldiers. Would we be sold into slavery to work in the desert? Or worse? I decided not to answer that question right now.

"How will we know when we get to the harbor?" I asked.

"When the road ends, we turn and continue toward Ulu."
