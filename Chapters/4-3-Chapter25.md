## Chapter 25

Rocks. Everywhere, rocks. I would never have believed that something so simple could haunt me as much as the rocks did on the path to Ara. Everywhere we walked, our journey was punctuated with sharp edges and unstable footing. We could barely see them but for the faintly ambient glow of Ara bouncing through the neverending cloud of dust, and a small oil lantern that Pomri had to continuously wipe clean. I was glad of her foresight.

"All these tracks are headed toward Rudjan," she said, observing carefully. "Would have been the children who couldn't swim that distance. They would have been captured by the blockade by now – never had a chance."

I imagined myself part of that swarm of children, running for our lives as rocks and ash came tumbling down from the sky and the ground, and then a regiment of Rudjanese soldiers comes to scoop us up. Would we be sold into slavery to work in the desert? Or killed on the spot? I decided not to answer that question right now.

"How will we know when we get to the harbor?" I asked.

"When the road ends, we turn and continue toward Ulu."

"End? Why would the..."

But the obvious answer came to me. I had imagined it as an explosion, a big fireball followed by a massive plume of smoke. But this was a giant chunk of metal, a spear the size of a boat, and it was falling – straight down, from far above the sky. I imagined its speed: faster than a train or a saffa, faster than I've ever seen anything move. I imagined it boring through the center of Palinan and coming out the other side. _It couldn't do that... right?_

"Pomri..?"

She glanced at me, hearing my curiosity.

"What exactly happened to Heiko?" I asked, anxiously.

She looked at me again, this time she held her stare.

"Why do you ask such questions?"

I had an answer but she wasn't looking for one.

"You'll find out soon enough. Best not to dwell on thoughts like that. Focus on the task at hand."

"Maybe we can find survivors quicker if we can figure out what areas were hit the hardest."

She turned to stop me, putting her hand on my shoulder.

"Look around, Linyu! You think someone could survive this chaotic mess?"

She lifted her hands and turned back toward the darkness.

"We're here for confirmation. For our own closure. Nothing more."

I wanted to cry, but got angry instead and took off walking in front of her. My tears were not for her to see.

Ahead and above in the distance, I heard the cries of a man, interspersed with fits of coughing – an even split of the two. At first I thought my ears betrayed me, but as we approached, the sound grew in volume. I traced it to a direction nearer Ara and took off. Pomri was behind me screaming "Wait!" but I did not stop.

The ground began to absolutely teem with rocks as it sloped upward. _This hill wasn't here before. Heiko is a flat grassland._ I reached a point where the rocks continued but the land leveled off again. A few paces away, I saw him through the dust. He knealt with his hands behind his head, nodding his torso back and forth. I came to him, yelling, "Aey-o. you alright?" but suddenly a rock below me gave way, and I stumbled. My reflexes lurched my hands towards the closest rocks, scraping them as they clambered for a solid grasp. Below me was a sudden drop and a black void. Its depth was unknowable, but I knew I would certainly die if I let go now.

"Got you," she said, grasping my wrist. "What are you thinking running off in the dark like that?"

My breath and my words were paused in shock as she pulled me back onto the clifftop.

"We've reached the crater. Try your best not to fall into it again."

As I caught my breath, I shushed Pomri to listen for the sounds of the man that led me here. Still he was crying, close to us yet unaware of me or Pomri.

"Who's there?" she asked harshly. But he didn't respond. She approached the sound carefully.

"Speak!" she tried being demanding, but still he didn't respond.

She laid a hand on his shoulder and he panicked, stumbling on himself and wheezing heavily as he backed away. His eyes were bloodshot, and his face caked with black ash.

"I have nothing to give you," he said staring at her feet. "Take my life or leave me to my grief," he said.

"Jesse? Is that you?"

He remained there, motionless, fighting back a cough and holding his hand to the back of his head.

"How did you survive?"

But still he did not move.

"He can't hear you," I chimed.

Pomri glanced back at me, apprehensive. Instead of fighting with her, I approached him slowly and held out my hand, to which he responded with his own. Upon his palm, I placed a finger and drew the words I wanted to say. _L-I-N-Y-U_, first, and then pointed to myself. Then _P-O-M-R-I_. His eyes lit up ever so slightly as if he knew that name, but he didn't look in her direction, only at me.

"I know Pomri. She warned us early. Got most of us out."

It occured to me that he may not yet have realized that he had gone deaf and partially blind.

"Ask him what happened," Pomri asked.

_W-H-A-T-H-A-P-P-_, he paused me, signaling that he understood.

"I was at the observatory when Holragi landed. Thimlu had a message he wanted to send, that he entrusted me to bring wherever you were going. But I didn't make it, did I?... That's okay though, because now you're here."

"That's great, Jesse," said Pomri, "What was the message?"

_W-H-A-_

"...I...I can't remember."

"You can't remember?"

She stooped down, holding the lantern to his face, and shook his hand eagerly.

"Try to remember," she demanded.

"I can't remember!" he cried. "I can't...my..."

His pupils began to constrict and we watched as his mind began to slip backward in time.

"Wait... who are you?... I have nothing to give you. Go away!"

He turned and shuffled away from us with his hand still holding the back of his head. With a fit, he coughed loudly as if he had been struggling to hold it in. Black mucus appeared on his hand.

"Leave me be," he said to us.

We stood there for a while, letting go of him and his fate. Then Pomri interjected, "Let's go," and took off toward Ulu. I lingered, though I knew it was impossible to help. I couldn't will myself to let him go. A hand rested on my shoulder and broke me from my trance.

"Hey. We need to get moving."

My legs began to move, but I was still in my mind, helplessly grasping at a thousand failures to help. Before the dust swallowed him, I looked back at his ashen face, and internalized the broken person that I saw there. And I promised myself never to forget.

We followed the crater edge toward the harbor, making a note of its size by tracking our paces from the long road to the Ulu road. The immensity of the crater was unsettling. If not for the dust, the realization of an absence the size of a city may have paralyzed me the way it had Jesse. But Pomri kept me going. And I wondered what kept her.

This place seemed so alien to me, even though I had been there just a day before. I struggled to understand even the minute parts of it: why were the rocks so jagged and the dust so incessant? were there others like Jesse, living only to die slowly? But I knew that if I asked she would say _"Oi, kaln. Now is not the time."_. So I did what my mother taught me to do once. I closed my eyes and saw myself through the dust from above, weaving perception together with inference to hold all of Heiko in my awareness. I saw it as I understood it – in the absence of sight, I could paint the image of my world on my mind. I saw a deep hole; as deep as the tallest tree is tall. A sword falling from the sky, turning the earth into dust, pushing it out in every direction. It was the concrete of their homes, the boulders upon which they built, cracked and heated and pulverized into trillions of rocks and pebbles and specks of dust. We were but a ship of the living making our way across an ocean of the dead.

"Lin, what're you doing?"

I snapped my eyes up and saw Pomri's lantern-lit face. The sound of waves and an odd rushing of water filled the air behind her. The dust was thinner here, as I presumed that the ocean was acting as a sponge, but a giant cloud of smoke stood directly between us and Ara, shortening our visibility to less than a Lao'ta.

"The crater continues into the water," she said. "There's nothing left."

Then she continued, "She's in there somewhere. I have to find her," and continued walking up the crater rim.

"Pomri, there's nothing over there!" I said in futility. But I had to follow her to make sure she was safe.

This was truly the darkest place in Palinan. I could no longer see anything save for glimpses of rock and Pomri – whatever her lantern revealed.

"Come on, Lin," she told me often. Her pace was far quicker than mine now, dodging and weaving through rocks. I stumbled through the same, having little time to adjust. Pomri's light danced around in the distance, growing smaller, quieter, more erratic, and I briefly panicked at the distance between her and me. I could no longer remember the ground where she ran, but I slogged through it anyway, tripping and shifting and stumbling about until I fell to the ground and could no longer keep up. I looked up to find her, and saw her light making a turn toward the water, bounding down the outside of the crater as if she'd seen something.

_What is she doing?_ I wondered, then in an instant, I saw a saffa. _That must be Boon-Boon. What's she-?_ I was startled from my focus by quick movements behind me.

"Who are you?", the voice from the cove had returned.

<!-- The following is bent on a crossing, but idk. It's also just a really good scene. -->

She paused for a moment, thinking of another way. She set down her lantern and produced a rope from her satchel, tying it first around herself, then around me.

"In case you fall in," she said. I remembered what it felt to fall into a crater, to drown in the dark, and I wasn't keen on doing either of those things again.

She led us over the rocks, jagged, and wet with the rushing of waves. Her spear became a pole to stabilize us on the treacherous jumps between rocks. I was thankful for the durability of my shoes.

Pomri secretly is betraying Linyu?
  Why tho?
