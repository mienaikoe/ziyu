  Annui flees to Rudjan?

  The chapter starts with the pair entering Heiko ruins: a massive crater of rubble. They have to sheild their lungs.

## Chapter 25

"Cover your nose and mouth," she told me, holding a shawl. I looked back at Laen, lying in a circle at the edge of the steppe, trying to find warmth in the thin light.

"Saffas need clean water regularly," Pomri explained. "And there's none of that in Heiko."

"I know. I just wanted to say goodbye."

"Make it quick."

I took the shawl and walked over to Laen with his ears perked up in anticipation. His gaze was trained upon me, yearning for answers that I couldn't find the words to explain.

From a satchel, I pulled a morsel of roasted seaweed I had brought from home and offered it to him.

"You hungry?"

He wasn't, but he took it gently out of respect and placed it on his left paw for later.

"WoOoo," he said in a grateful tone.

I found the spot on his back where he loved to be scratched and ran my fingers through his fur. His reflexes shook him with satisfaction. Then I stopped and laid my head and hands against him and he rested his head on the ground and tilted it to the side to better hear me.

"Thank you for getting us here, Laen. It would have taken us va'na without you."

"I don't know what lies ahead for either of us, but we have to split up. Heiko is a dangerous place now and we don't want you to get hurt."


*What will you do now?*, I wondered. Every departure seemed to be more of a goodbye.
