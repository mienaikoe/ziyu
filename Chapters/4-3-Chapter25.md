  The chapter starts at the edge of Heiko ruins: a massive crater of rubble.

## Chapter 25

The ground was punctuated with innumerable rocks, both sharply-pointed and still quite warm. We could barely see them but for the barely ambient glow of Ara on dust, and a lantern that Pomri had to continuously wipe clean. I was glad of her foresight.

"All these tracks are headed toward Rudjan," she said, observing carefully. "Would have been the children who couldn't swim that distance. They would have been captured by the blockade by now – never had a chance."

I imagined myself part of that swarm of children, running for our lives, only to be scooped up by a regiment of Rudjanese soldiers. Would we be sold into slavery to work in the desert? Or killed on the spot? I decided not to answer that question right now.

"How will we know when we get to the harbor?" I asked.

"When the road ends, we turn and continue toward Ulu."

"End? Why would the..."

But the obvious answer came to me. I had imagined it as an explosion, a big fireball followed by a massive plume of smoke. But this was a giant chunk of metal, a spear the size of a boat, and it was falling – straight down, from far above the sky. I imagined its speed: faster than a train or a saffa, faster than I've ever seen anything move. I imagined it boring through the center of Palinan and coming out the other side. *It couldn't do that... right?*

"Pomri..?"

She glanced at me, hearing my curiosity.

"What exactly happened to Heiko?" I asked, anxiously.

She looked at me again, this time she held her stare.

"Why do you ask such questions?"
