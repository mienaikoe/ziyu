  The chapter starts with the pair entering Heiko ruins: a massive crater of rubble. They have to sheild their lungs.

## Chapter 25

"Cover your nose and mouth," she told me, holding a shawl.

We reached the 1 lao'ka marking rock with dust in the air, hanging invisible to the eyes, but heavy to the nose. Laen had begun to sneeze a bit himself. I looked back at him, lying in a circle at the edge of the path, trying to find warmth in the thin light.

"I don't have anything that he could put on," Pomri explained, "He'll have to stay here."

"I know... I just wanted to say goodbye."

"Make it quick. We still have quite a hike before we reach the pier."

I took the shawl from her hands and walked over to Laen with his ears perked up in anticipation. His gaze was trained upon me, yearning for answers that I couldn't find the words to explain.

From a satchel, I pulled a morsel of roasted seaweed I had brought from home and offered it to him.

"You hungry?"

He wasn't, but he took it gently out of respect and placed it on his left paw for later.

"WoOoo," he said in a grateful tone.

I found the spot on his back where he loved to be scratched and ran my fingers through his fur. His reflexes shook him with satisfaction. Then I stopped and laid my head and hands against him and he rested his head on the ground and tilted it to the side to better hear me.

"Thank you for getting us here, Laen. It would have taken us va'na without you."

He didn't respond, just took in the moment.

"There's no safe place in the world now, you know? Your home... and," I looked at the cloud of dust over Heiko, moved my focus to Ara. "The obscura."

Laen made a long sigh, and I followed him, trying to process my reality.

"Laen... When we're done here, you can stay with us. In Ulukoma."




*What will you do now?*, I wondered. Every departure seemed to be more of a goodbye.
