## Chapter 4

The station was just beginning to fill with merchants and travelers waiting for the next train after the day's first nap. From afar, a warm breeze caressed my nose with the sweet aroma of freshly-baked handcakes and pulled me closer to Gilli's bakery just outside the station. In a heartbeat, Laen had caught sight of the bakery and bolted from behind me to his favorite place in the whole world.

"Laen!" I yelled at him. If I'm being honest, I wanted mine first. When I caught up to him, he was jumping all over the place, begging Gilli for a cake.

"I'm sorry, Gilli," I said. "I promised him one back home and I'm sure it's been on his mind this whole way."

She laughed and said, "Oh it's alright. Everyone in Heiko deserves a cake, even saffas. Here!"

She tossed a roasted tor-nut handcake into the air and Laen caught it with his mouth with impeccable precision.

"Could I bother you for a couple more for myself and a friend?" I asked.

"Just keep those pohua shipments coming in," she said, then handed me two of the same kind. I reached out to take them, but she didn't let go. "I mean it," she said under her breath, "I need more. That last shipment you gave me was makes a far superior syrup than idze."

I looked at her and smiled uncomfortably, "Y-yea... I'll... See what I can do."

Her smile returned, and she said, "Thank you, Liffa... Here, take another!"

I quickly stowed one in my bag for Pomri, then eyed the other two in my hands. In one bite, the juicy sweetness of pohua filled my mouth with a familiar flavor. She wasn't wrong. They were better than I remembered them.

Suddenly, from the corner of my eye, I saw a dark shadow coming over my hand and Laen's whole head swooped down to steal the barely-eaten cake.

"Laen! That was mine!" I yelled. I gave him a slap on the shoulder and turned away from him to hide my last one. He barely noticed through the chewing.

"Once you're done," I told him through my last two bites, "you go back home ok?" He was still licking his lips, but I knew he'd heard me. I left him humming with satisfaction at the corner, glancing back with an adoring eye before rounding the corner into the train station.

My feet found some rest with my back against a tree near the tracks. I'd oriented myself to hide from Kipnu if he had decided to follow me. _This is the right thing_, I affirmed to myself. _No externalities_. I thought about the crops I had just planted a few days ago. Whether Tiggu would kill them out of spite, or replant them in her own field. But my mind found its way back to the note I was about to deliver. What so powerful a meaning could live within those charcoal ink scribblings?

The station attendant's voice spread through the air as thi called for us through a flathorn, "Train to Shaki approaching."

I quickly picked up my bag and walked toward the growing crowd. The attendant was tall for a maman, but hae voice seemed to go with hae body. I caught a glimpse of a new flow tattoo across hae neck when thi turned around: one strand of dark black differentiating into hundreds of intricate threads of infrared across hae neck. I admired it from afar as I shifted into the line for the 9th car. I remembered when I'd gotten a flow tattoo when I was younger. Working in the constant light of Ara made the ink turn black, so it looked as if I had some weird genetic defect. My mother laughed when I told her, and recounted how thi had had the same results when thi was my age.

The train came rumbling in, its engines and brakes hissing with steam. Thi called again, "Train to Shaki. Stops in Rudjan, Yansha, Shaki Harbor, Shaki Central." The crowd fell into a tighter line against the wall, itching to find a decent place to sit.

"Excuse me," a voice behind me called. "Would you help an old man?"

He was a older man with a polished silver cane in his right hand that he was clearly making use of. Upon his face was a perfect Holragi smile – so perfect that I ought to have known better than to trust it. I obliged his request, lending my hand to him to climb the steps into the carriage.

"Thank you, my kaln," he said. I had grown accustomed to condescension, being a maman that I was, but the endearment in his voice surprised me. It was as if he'd called me a child as a compliment.

"I haven't been a kaln in ages," I told him.

"Oh, I meant no offense," he explained. "At my age everyone's a youngling; boys, girls, and kalns alike." It was a wholly unsatisfying answer, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt.

The Ara-light and the wind that it brings had grown to its mid-day peak, but the thick kelpen curtains fastened tightly to the wall made them both much more pleasant. The seats were mostly empty but I took one across the carriage from the man; far enough to remain strangers, close enough to become friends. He had trouble finding a good spot for his right leg which seemed to lack the ability to bend, but eventually he settled on a position.

"In all my years of riding trains, I've yet to find a spacious seat for people of my condition."

"Perhaps the train builders don't know how difficult it is for you," I said.

"There are many of us in the world. A sliver of empathy and an old man like me could sit in peace. Instead, a patient sweet maman like you has to bear my complaints."

I was surprised by his choice of words. "I've passed the age where charm has an effect, I'm afraid."

"Oh, pardon my forwardness. I'm often told that I say too much of what I mean," he explained.

I nodded, understanding his view. "Too many of my generation are afraid to speak their minds," I said. "Perhaps they could learn something from you."

He smirked. "Charm still has an effect to me, in spite of my age."

I laughed but became suddenly conscious of the loud and awkward sound of my own voice. Luckily, he didn't seem to mind.

He began again, "so what brings you to the capital?" I froze a bit, surprised that he could guess where I was going.

"My jundwoman works there," I stuttered. "Just bringing her something."

"Ahh. Coming all this way to surprise your jundwoman. How thoughtful," he said, almost patronizing.

"Heh. Yea..." I trickled my words that I wouldn't say too much. "I hope she receives it well."

"A good jundwoman would appreciate an attempt to brighten her day," he said.

"We haven't been too happy with each other lately, so I hope you're right."

"Yes, that will happen from time to time," his voice had a tinge of melancholy. "I still remember once, I was squabbling with my jundmaman about my son's first formal robe. We never even asked him what he wanted to wear; we were too bent on winning the fight. For weeks, It went on like an obsession. We didn't speak, we didn't eat together. But then one day," he snapped the air with his fingers.

"... what?" I asked. "One day, what?"

"The fever was gone. Such an overwhelming impediment was reduced to a trifle. They all end the same way."

"You've never had a fight that wouldn't stop?"

He paused and looked at me as if he had seen a younger version of himself in me. "...I'd rather not talk about such things."

"I didn't mean to pry. It's just... if you have any advice, it would be greatly appreciated."

"Perhaps your parents would give better advice than a man like me," he said.

"My mother died shortly before I got married. My father and nather... well I never knew them," I said. I hoped that opening up to him would make him do the same.

"Oh, that's terrible..." He said, visibly uncomfortable. "Well you did a splendid job raising yourself. Must be those child-rearing instincts you maman have that got you through it."

"They aren't instincts," I explained. "We learn them just like any other skill."

"Oh but you're all so good at it."

"We spend a lot of time doing it. If men and women helped us, they'd be great at it too," I retorted.

He sighed, "We all have a place in society."

The heat of anger came to me again, as it had with Tiggu. I turned my eyes toward the curtain, staring between stitches at the dark void of Ulu, while he turned his toward Ara. And like a switch, we'd returned to being strangers on the train.

"Shaki Harbor! Approaching Shaki Harbor!" The conductor had come through our car and was repeating the next stop down the aisle. The suddenness of his voice roused me from my belated midday nap, and I opened my eyelids to rejoin reality. _Shaki Harbor? I must have been out for a while._

I sat upright and glanced at the older man in the next seat, sleeping with his leg on the seat across. He looked as sound as a rock. I turned to the outside, facing a screen through which an earthen-smelling air was flowing from a dark, infrared landscape. I could make out some short trees and dugout homes amongst the semi-arid hills ambling in the distance, but there were no rolling fields of grain or lush orchards as there were in Heiko. How could Melna feel so comfortable in such a different place?

The train slowed to a stop and opened its doors, but again only a few people boarded. The cake had not sustained me, and I began to crave a real meal. _Perhaps I ought to treat myself to something nice in the capital... No... I don't have time for that._

I looked over at the bag by my side and saw a corner of the paper message peeking out. Could such a small thing really change so much? My fingers paused on its edges, hesitating, remembering that Thimlu gave me this message under the confidence that I would not read it. _But I am an observer, the same as them. I should know the same as them._ The letter was marred with creases from all my roaming about, but luckily the fibers and the ink held strong. I saw the dots and the circle I had seen before, but now I could make out the writing.

```
Obscura Observation
Melna,

I am following up on our conversations about colder temperatures in Heiko and other western sectors. After 20 days of observation of Ara, we have measured no measured reduction in stellar activity and no change in stellar size. However, we did detect a decrease in incident light. This is likely caused by a large diffuse obstruction. For brevity, we will call this obstruction "the obscura".

It's difficult to identify the cause, but it's unlikely to be a natural phenomenon as the cloud is roughly homogenous and is growing linearly. As for size, we've concluded that the obscura is following our orbital period in the lagrange point, as a spherical or toroidal cloud would quickly collapse without constant adjustment. It's anybody's guess what this thing is, but personally, I think it's a weapon.

If left alone, the obscura will likely cause colder temperatures, weaker winds, and decreased precipitation. We have some rough estimates for what that will mean to our food supply based on prior cold eras, but I want to caution that this will be unlike any cold era we've ever had.
- 7 days: Fish along the coastlines will migrate to the Bay of Dala'a
- 8 days: Grains and Orchard fruits will go dormant
- 10 days: Roots will go dormant
- 13-15 days: Clay freezes up to 2 paces and all crops die off

We advise immediate action to stop this by any means necessary. We will continue to monitor and update you everyday, and would appreciate your advice on how we can communicate more efficiently in this time.

- Thimlu
```

"Obscura?" I whispered aloud, then glanced over at the old man to make sure he was still sleeping. I could feel my skin getting cold with anxiety. _The farm. Our home... what happens now? And the senate would dismiss me as a lunatic if I interrupt them for something this outlandish. Ulukoma would be a death sentence if it got any colder._ It was too much to think of. I closed my eyes, and rode the waves of anxiety back down. _Now I know why Thimlu was guarding this secret_. I folded up the letter in one nervous motion and put it back in my bag, returning my thoughts to my head and my gaze toward the vast darkness of Ulu. _I must deliver this message as soon as possible. My worries can wait until later; I'm doing the right thing for all of Palinan and that's all I need._

"You look like you've seen something you'd rather not have," said the man, startling me. I shot my eyes toward his, gray, washed-out facade and narrowed my eyes in anticipation of some kind of judgment.

"Mind your eyes," I scoffed. "My personal life isn't for your entertainment." I was well at the edge of my politeness for the day.

"You ought to mind your tongue," he replied while looking away, with a grin that lavished in seeing anger.

"Do you have something to say to me?" I asked pointedly.

He sighed and said, "A man by the name of Kipnu sent me to accompany you in your travels." _Dammit, Kip._ "I assume you know him?"

The conversation had become poisoned with distrust. I turned my face away from him and toward the curtain beside me, hoping the silence would break the conversation.

But he continued. "Let me start over. My name is Fajro, and I used to be a fidelant for Holragi a long time ago. Your provincial fidelant, Melna, was just getting started near the end of my tenure. She was a real firebrand back then," he said with a smirk. "Her words had a sort of spice to them, and they took her quite far."

"I didn't ask for an introduction."

"Patience, kaln," he retorted gently. "I promise this chat will be worth all the sleep you're missing." He adjusted his posture to face me and started again. "I happened to be in Heiko earlier today, seeking a consultation about my leg when Kipnu told me. He said that you were trying to deliver a message to the senate: a message so important that you're willing to risk the island of darkness to deliver it."

My frustration turned inward as I wondered how much else Kipnu told him about. But I re-centered my mind and affirmed my duty as an observer. "My business is–"

"–not going so well. I can tell by the look on your face." He was persistent in his speech.

I continued more forcefully than before, "As I was saying, my business is not yours to scrutinize."

"Ah but it could so easily be," He said. "You see, delivering a message to a senate already in session is no small task. You'll need someone who's done it before."

My train of thought had come to a complete stop once I'd fully understood what he was saying. I considered his proposal: an ex-fidelant who knew the ins and outs of the senate would make this a lot easier. He could vouch for me, and maybe I would face a lesser sentence. But his constant smiling and insistent bigotry made my skin crawl. I had to know his angle.

"Why would you help me?" I asked.

He smiled and said, "Melna and I were close friends back when we were fidelants. I'd love nothing more than to help you deliver this important message in a way that doesn't look badly on her. Let's just say I owe her a favor long past due."

I scrutinized his every detail for some hint of deception, the way Melna tried to teach me to do once. But his entire demeanor was a wall without openings, and I was an unskilled climber. I knew I had something he wanted but I didn't have the time to figure it out. This was my chance.

"I have one condition," I said.

"Oh? And what's that?" he asked.

"Make sure I don't go to Ulukoma."

He smiled again, thinking for a pause, and said, "You have my word."

I was surprised at how quickly he agreed, but it was too late to ask for more. We were now bound to the same goal.

"We have a deal then," I said in a tone so enrobed in sweetness that I had nearly forgotten the pit in my stomach where a second cake was supposed to be.

"I also have a condition," he said. "I can get you into the senate, and put the guards at ease, but I will not follow you in or introduce you. Otherwise, I won't be able to bargain with the magistrate."

"But I need you to help me find my way," I said. "You told me that it's like a second home to you."

"It's a room of half-asleep diplomats. They probably won't even see you. Keep a low profile, and you'll be fine. Trust me, you'll need an ally at the hearing more than at the senate."

"I can survive Ulukoma."

He bellowed a single laugh. "It's not surviving that's difficult – it's leaving that wretched place. A lawless island in the middle of the ocean where the damned lead the foolish. The ones who come back are never the same again. I'm no legalist but I am certain that Lanre would be ashamed."

I stared at the thatched seat in front of me and imagined Melna there, comforting me, inviting me to sit at her side. But it all felt unnatural, forced. Melna had her own life when she came to Shaki. Didn't she? I imagined being dragged from the building, the paper dropping from my fingers, Melna's eyes turned away. This version of events felt far more palpable.

Inside me, a silent fury was welling up: a frustration at the injustice of the law in Shaki. I pondered at Ulukoma, a lawless island prison in the ocean, a place I might come to know if Fajro didn't keep his end of the bargain. _Why can people not leave that place?_

The conductor barreled into the car and yelled, "Shaki Central! Last stop!"

Fajro looked to me with a smirk and asked, "Would you help an old man?"
