## Chapter 4

The station was just filling up for the next train after the day's first nap. The warm and sweet aroma of freshly-baked handcakes caressed my nose and pulled me closer to Gilli's bakery at the far corner of the station. I figured that I'd earned something nice, so I turned to let my nose take me closer. But Laen had been waiting for his moment, and he bolted toward the bakery as soon as he saw me stop.

"Laen!" I yelled at him. If I'm being honest, I wanted to get mine first.

I caught up to him as he was begging Gilli for a cake.

"I'm sorry, Gilli. I promised him I would get him one."

She laughed and said, "Oh it's alright. Everyone in Heiko deserves a cake, even saffas. Here!"

She tossed a roasted tor-nut handcake into the air and Laen caught it with his mouth with impeccable precision.

"Could I bother you for another for myself?"

"Just keep those pohua shipments coming in," she said, and handed me one of the same kind.

I reached out to take it, but she didn't let go.

"I mean it," she said under her breath, "I need more. That last shipment you gave me was fantastic. It makes a better syrup than idze."

I looked at her and smiled uncomfortably, slightly intimidated, "Y-yea... I'll... See what I can do."

Her smile returned, and she said, "Thank you, Liffa... Next!"

I took one bite and tasted the juicy sweetness. She wasn't wrong. They had gotten better than I remembered them being. But then a dark shadow came over my hand and swooped down to steal my cake.

"Laen! That was mine!" I yelled, and gave him a slap on the shoulder. He barely noticed through his chewing.

"Once you're done, go back home ok?"

He didn't respond, but I knew he'd heard me. I left him in at the corner, humming with his stolen cake and a handful of water from my canteen, and made my way to the platform.

My feet found some rest squatting and leaning against a tree near the tracks, hiding from the wind and from Kipnu if he had decided to follow me. _This is the right thing_, I affirmed to myself. _No externalities. No liabilities_. I thought about the crops I had just planted. Whether Melna would ask Tiggu to work on them. Whether she would kill them out of spite, or replant them in her own field. If this is as important as Jathi said, then those crops don't matter in the scheme of things. Heiko would understand.

The station attendant called for us through a flathorn, "Train to Shaki approaching. All passengers prepare to marshal."

I quickly picked up my bag and jumped the wall to the marshalling side. The attendant was tall for a maman with a recent flow tattoo mutating into hundreds of threads of infrared across hae neck. I admired it from afar as I shifted into the line for the 9th car. I had gotten a flow tattoo once, but working in the constant light of Ara made my skin's water vessels flow too quickly, so it all mixed together and just looked like I had some weird genetic defect in my hydroderm. My parents just laughed and told me about how they had tried it too when they were kids, and had the same results.

The train came rumbling in with its engines and brakes humming with electrical blood. Thi called again, "Train to Shaki. Stops in Rudjan Ara, Rudjan Ulu, Yansha, Shaki Harbor, Shaki Central."

The crowd fell into a tighter line against the wall, itching to find a decent place to sit.

"Excuse me, would you help me get in?"

Behind me was a older man with a polished steel cane that he was leaning on heavily. He looked up to me with a smile that I had to return, and I leant my hand to him to climb the steps into the carriage.

"Thank you, my kaln," he said.

I laughed, "I haven't been called a kaln in ages."

"Oh, at my age, everyone is a youngling."

_I suppose that's true._

The seats were mostly empty but I took one across the carriage from the man - far enough not to creep him out - and put my bag down in the next seat. The sun and wind had grown to its mid-day peak, but the reinforced curtains made them both much more pleasant for a long ride. The man was finding a good spot for his legs as the seats weren't exactly spacious enough for an extended leg, but he eventually settled on a position.

"In all my years of riding trains, they've never built at least one spacious seat for people of my condition."

"Maybe none of them are living with your problem," I said.

"A sliver of empathy from them and an old man could sit in peace. Instead, a patient sweet maman like you has to bear my complaints."

"Charming a young maman? At your age?"

"I'm often told that I say too much of what I mean. Some may consider it charming, I suppose."

"Well, I believe that too many of my generation are afraid to speak, so I'm glad you're around to set us straight."

He chortled, "Charming an old man. At your age?"

I laughed. It was loud and it was awkward, but I knew he wouldn't mind.

He began again, "so what's taking you to the capital?"

I froze a bit, stuttering, but said "My jundwoman works there. Just bringing her something."

"Ahh. Surprising your jundwoman. I bet she'll be excited," he said.

"Heh. Yea. I hope she receives it well."

"A good jundwoman would be happy that you thought to brighten her day like that."

"Well we haven't been too happy with each other lately, so I hope you're right."

"Yes, that will happen from time to time. I still remember once, my spouses and I were fighting about a color for our daughter's first sleeping rug. We never even asked her what she wanted; we were too obsessed with winning the fight. For weeks, It was like an obsession or a fever. We didn't speak, we didn't eat together. But then one day," he snapped the air with his fingers.

"... what?" I asked. "One day, what?"

"The fever is gone. And insignificant."

"Did you ever have a fight that didn't stop?"

He paused and looked at me as if he had seen a younger version of himself in me.

"...Perhaps we should stop now."

"I don't mean to pry. It's just... if you have any advice, it would be greatly appreciated."

"Can't you ask your parents for advice? I don't like to get into family squabbles like this."

"My mother died right before I got married. My father and nather... were never really present." I said. I hoped that opening up to him would make him do the same.

"Oh no. That's terrible..." He said, visibly uncomfortable. "Well you did a splendid job raising yourself. Must be those child-rearing instincts you maman have that got you through it."

"They aren't instincts. We learn them just like any other skill."

"Oh but you're all so good at it."

"We spend a lot of time doing it. If men and women helped us, they'd be great at it too," I retorted.

He sighed, "We all have a place in society."

I turned forward and stopped talking before I said something I would regret. He returned his head back to the curtain, staring between stitches at the bright void of Ara. Like a switch, we returned to being strangers on the train.

"Shaki Harbor! Approaching Shaki Harbor!" The conductor barreled in and blurted into the car. I pulled over both of my eyelids and rejoined reality.

"Shaki Harbor! Approaching Sha-," He repeated to the next car as the door closed behind him. _Shaki Harbor? I must have been out for a while._ I sat upright and glanced at the older man in the next seat, sleeping with his leg on the seat across. He looked as sound as a rock. I turned to the outside, facing a screen that blasted an earthen air from a dark, infrared landscape. I could make out some trees amongst the semi-arid hills and houses ambling in the distance. _All of this place. The trees, the animals, the people. Everywhere I've ever been could freeze over in a dim light because of some change in the white dot on the horizon._ I shuddered thinking about what Palinan might feel like if that happened.

The train slowed to a stop and opened its doors, but again only a few people boarded. The roll had not sustained me, and I was really craving a real meal. _Perhaps I ought to treat myself to something nice in the capital before I get banished to the wilderness... No... I don't have time for that._

I took out the letter to review it and think about how I might deliver it. The letter was marred with creases from all the travel, but luckily the fibers and the ink held up. I saw the dots and the circle again, but now I could make out the sentences.

```
Obscura Observation
Melna,

I am following up on our conversations about colder temperatures in Heiko and other western sectors. After 20 Tova of observation of Ara, we have measured no measured reduction in stellar activity and no change in stellar size. However, we did detect a decrease in incident light. This is likely caused by a large diffuse obstruction made up of smaller objects. For brevity, we will call this collection "the obscura". It is difficult to estimate the size of each object, but they seem to span the entire view we have of Ara. Upon closer observation, we conclude that they are unlikely to be caused by a natural phenomenon as the obstructions seem to be growing in number and are moving in tandem so to be evenly-spaced.

If left alone, we calculate that the obscura will cause colder temperatures, weaker winds, and decreased precipitation, which will lead to most seasonal crops to become dormant in six days. In ten days, the temperatures and incident light will be low enough to freeze and kill all known crops. We advise immediate action to clear the obstruction. We will continue to monitor and update you everyday, and would appreciate your advice on how we can communicate more efficiently in this time.

- Jathi

"What is this??" I murmured out loud, then glanced over at the old man to make sure he was still sleeping. I could feel my skin getting wet and cold in anxiety. _Kipnu... Melna... what will happen to them? Our home. The garden... And how will the senate receive this? They would dismiss me as a lunatic if I interrupt them for something this outlandish. If I get sent to Ulukoma, while they prepare for the cold, what will I come back to?_ It was too much to think of. I closed my eyes, and I rode the waves of anxiety back down. _I must deliver this message. I can think about the future later. For now, I'm doing the right thing for all of Palinan and that's all I need._ I folded up the letter and put it back in my bag, returning my thoughts to my head and my gaze toward the vast darkness of Ulu.

"You look like you've seen something you'd rather not have," said the man, startling me.

I shot my eyes toward his, gray, washed-out.

"Pardon?" I jabbed. I was at the edge of my day's limit for politeness.

He chuckled, "Kipnu told me you were just like Melna. You're far worse."

"Do you have something to say to me?"

"He also told me what you're trying to do. I must say, I was a bit annoyed when I had to reschedule my appointment with him."

_Damn it, Kipnu._

I snapped back, "And you intend to stop me with that leg of yours?"

"Oh, on the contrary. I intend to help you."

"Help me? Why?"

"My name is Fajro. I used to be a senior Holragi fidelant at the senate back when your bundwoman, Melna, was just getting started there. She was a real firebrand when she started. Her words had a sort of spice, and I knew it very well."

I didn't appreciate his tone.

"You haven't answered my question."

"Patience, kaln, I'm getting there," he retorted gently and adjusted his seat. "Let's just say I owe her a favor long past due, and I consider this gesture a part of the repayment. Whatever was on that paper of yours, it must be important enough that you're willing to risk the frozen badlands for it."

"I assure you it is."

"Good. You wouldn't dare waste my time traveling in this uncomfortable train for nothing."

"I wouldn't dare," I said in a tone so enrobed in sweetness that I had nearly forgotten the pit in my stomach where cake was supposed to be.

"So, let's get down to details. I can get you into the senate, and put the guards at ease, but I will not follow you in or introduce you. I'm not getting wrapped up in this."

"Wait, wait. I never said I was barging into the senate?"

"Why else would you be traveling there alone?"

He had my entire plan figured out. How?

"You would be a tremendous help in vouching for me."

"Ah... but I really wouldn't"

"But you were a fidelant."

"I was..." he said . "I didn't exactly leave on the best terms."

"What do you mean?"

"There were some fidelants that I didn't exactly see eye-to-eye with. And we would often resort to...vulgarities to express our disdain for each other."

"So? People shout at each other all the time."

"Has Melna never told you what the Senate's laws are like? They were written by religious fanatics hundreds of ma'tova ago. Any sort of shouting or vulgarity is considered a 'corruption of consciousness' and isn't tolerated. Needless to say, they had to let me go."

"Why you and not the others?"

"The tribes of Holrag were insignificant members of the unification treaty. The city-states of the east.. well they played a bigger role."

"That's ridiculous."

"That's politics."

I was silently furious at how unjust the Senate could be, but took it as a lesson on how not to argue with the fidelants.

Fajro began again, "So the next hurdle you will face is that the mediator will try to shut you up. That microphone can be surprisingly loud."

"I'll just talk louder."

He chuckled at my idea, "Well, there's another way. You can use someone else's microphone."

"That sounds...difficult."

"Ordinarily, yes. But you have someone on your side already in there."

_Melna_. "No...I couldn't. I would tarnish her reputation forever."

"How important is this discovery?"

I thought about how Melna might react. She would be furious no matter what I did. Her reputation in the senate would be forever tied to me, but if the observers are right, then we would be remembered in a positive light.

He continued, "A normal person would have difficulties at every turn doing what you want to do. But you... you have us."

I stared at the thatched seat in front of me. I imagined Melna there, comforting me, inviting me to speak to the senate. It all felt unnatural, forced. She didn't trust me. I was a just some farmer she fell in love with once.

One day, she would understand.

The Conductor called out "Shaki Central! Last stop, everyone off!"

"Would you help a cripple?" He asked me with a smirk. I smiled back and held out my arm.
