## Chapter 12

"Are you sure they're landing here?" he asked. "I think we came in from over there."

"I'm sure of it. Nanta decides which way to turn depending on the currents. She's not real fond of her job, but she keeps the boat running smoothly."

"Sounds like you know her well."

"I'm one of the few voluntary travelers between Ulukoma and Rudjan these days... Tends to raise a few eyebrows."

Kipnu looked out at the dark sea and the hint of red and infrared that lie above it. There was far more he could see now that his eyes had adjusted to the dark, but the waves were still waves and the rail was still rail. He wondered at Casra's stoic nature, how thi held the same expression no matter the hardship: calm, intelligent, and resolute. However this plan turned out, he was certain that a better one didn't exist.

He glanced again at the tank of fresh water he had been tasked to carry and his eyes wandered to Casra's satchel of kanosin antidote, and Linyu's satchel of hot tips and listeners. He wondered if thi could really start a resistance with something so small, but then he remembered that life under Shinna was a struggle and that gestures of kindness were rare. If he had been given such a warm welcome after such a harsh goodbye, he would have followed hae anywhere.

"There, a bit to the North," Linyu said. They strained their eyes to see two ships on the horizon nearing the end of the rails.

"Two ships?" asked Casra, incredulously. Kipnu was just as confused as thi was.

They drew closer, and the front ship began its turning maneuver. A huge crowd of people was thrown off the side all at once, all without bindings on their arms, and they flailed about in the water struggling to float in the disturbance.

"Quickly!" Casra yelled and the three ran toward the closest point on the shoreline where Linyu ran toward the treeline to gather wood and make a fire. Kipnu pushed his bag to a startled Casra, and leapt into the icy sea.

The cold of the water bit at his limbs but he wasn't letting it bother him - these people needed his help. The pebble sea floor took him as far as it could, and he kicked up to swim toward that crimson red horizon. But before could reach them, the second boat began keeling, pouring more people out into the water – many with tied hands. He reached one man who was gasping in shock at the cold water, showing signs of confusion.

"On your back!" Kipnu yelled at the man, but he didn't respond. Kipnu latched their arms together, and began swimming backward toward the shore until a woman came upon them.

She yelled between waves, "I've got him. There's a girl. Second boat. Arms tied."

Kipnu understood her, and swam back out to find the child, but he didn't see any signs of struggle. His feet were starting to go numb: the beginning of hypothermia. But he ignored it. He took a deep breath and dove under the water, opening his eyes despite the sting. He gained depth until he saw the faint glow of two blue eyes upon the sea floor. The distance was quite long at this point, so he surfaced to catch his breath before diving again. Five strokes, ten strokes, twenty. His breaths were straining as her eyes receded further into the deep. Thirty. He had to turn back. But he was so close now. Patches of color began to fill his vision and his muscles started to spasm and lock up - first his legs, then his arms, and then he started to sink.

A hand grabbed his shirt, tugged to pull him out, and he watched her eyes recede into the deep as the light of Ara returned to his vision.

The woman was in a canoe with the confused man while he sensed that Casra was with him in the water. Kipnu was confused, but conscious of what was going on. Casra lifted Kipnu as the woman pulled him onto the canoe and nestled him lengthwise into the middle of the boat.

"She's... still down there," he said, between deep breaths.

"It's too dangerous," said Casra. "I barely made it to you. I couldn't go further."

"No," he said. "I can... I can–"

"She's gone," said the woman sternly.

He fell silent at her voice, and continued to do so as they pulled some of the stragglers to the side of their boat and untied their arms. Kipnu had never seen such wanton carelessness for life before. If not for their canoe and preparations, surely hundreds more could have died or fallen gravely ill. And who were the people on the first ship? With their ands were unbound, and the deck swollen with their numbers?

Their boat made it to shore, and Casra lifted Kipnu out and set him near to the fire. Thi laid underneath him to give him warmth just as he had done for Linyu.

"C...Casra"

"Shh. Just focus on getting warmer."

His muscle control began to return and violent full-body shivers came along with it. He moaned in agony as feeling slowly returned to his limbs and his digits. An unbending rage began to build; first from his belly then circling around him and back inward, and it overtook his mind. That girl had a name, had a family, how could Shaki be so callous!

He wrestled free from Casra's grasp, and made a direct line for the trees. Casra stood up and dusted haeself off as the massive crowd of people looked on at them.

"We'll be back," thi said, and trotted off after Kipnu.

"Kipnu, what's wrong?"

"I need a moment," he said in an angry tone.

"Come back and warm up. You're confused right now."

"I said. I'm fine."

Thi moved into his line of sight, looked at him with a stern eye, but his own remained vacantly fixed inward.

"I was this close to saving her. Then you pulled me out."

Casra grabbed his arm and leaned hae face into his.

"You weren't going to save shit," thi said. "You were going to die."

He was snapped from his cloud of frustration by the tone of hae voice. He hadn't heard this side of hae before.

"You're acting like a child, taking risks like you're invincible. But there are people behind those risks, people who need you to stay alive. Maybe you weren't the hero you wanted to be, but that doesn't mean you aren't a good man."

Kipnu responded with a voice subdued but not wholly defeated.

"I know my limits, Casra. I could have saved her."

He wrestled free from hae grip.

"If you didn't want my help, you should never have plucked me from Shinna."

"You're telling me you'd rather be a mindless drone for Shinna than cautious with your life?"

"Why should I even care what happens here?" he said. "You found me a boat. I'm getting off this dark prison island you call a home and heading straight for Heiko to save the only people that matter to me. That's the only problem that matters to me right now."

Casra was hurt, but thi didn't let it show.

"These people have come in droves to a place they've only heard about, afraid and cold and defenseless. They need someone to lead them away from Shinna."

"Then _you_ do that. Re-form your council. What I do with my life is up to me."

He spoke firmly, leaving no room in his voice for thought or compromise.

"Then go on," thi said. "Leave this place and go be the hero you want to be. This time you won't have me to stop you."

Thi receded swiftly toward the beach, leaving Kipnu to his anger. And as thi grew further away, his conviction melted to humility. No, this was a game. Thi would stop at some point and ask him to come back.

But Casra didn't stop.

Linyu stood just near a young campfire, looking out at the crowd before hae. There were hundreds dotting the shore, huddled around multiple fires that had borrowed from the first. Thi had run out of bread to pass out, so everyone was splitting pieces for each other, and huddling to keep warm. Thi was relieved to see hae mother trekking down the treeline, but quickly saw that thi was unhappy.

Casra stood next to Linyu and called out to the group, asking for quiet before addressing them.

"Mamen, Women, Men. My name is Casra, and I'm a doctor here on Ulukoma. What you've just seen and been through represents the dark side of Shaki's governance. To them, you're just a criminal, a number on a manifest. But your lives are worth more than your mistakes."

Every eye on that beach was fixed upon on Casra, searching for any sign that they would be safe.

"I wish that I could tell you that things were different here, but there are people on this island that would shackle and drug every one of us to reap the fruit of _our_ labor, the work of _our_ hands. If you want to survive in this place, you will all have to fight for your freedom."

A single pair of hands began to clap from a fire far away. It was a man, standing near a fire with the trees behind him, dressed in a thick black kelpen tunic with large rusted steel fasteners that seemed to be doubling as armor. Casra recognized him immediately.

He spoke mockingly into the breeze as if he himself was king of Ulukoma. "Such drama, Casra. It's a shame your talents are wasted on an addict."

A maman not much older than Linyu and dressed in a tight black robe tugged on his arm to stop, but he pushed hae away with ease and stepped closer to Casra.

He spoke to the crowd now, "Shinna grants the wishes of those who have earned their place in society. Wealth beyond what the mainland can offer, attention from the other sexes, euphoria that expands your reality. Now, ask yourself if you've earned it. If you're one of those vile criminals from the second boat, then by all means, follow Casra to hae hole in the ground. But if you're an upstanding member of society and you've come here to find a haven from the obscura, then come with me to the Great Pavilion. You deserve to be a part of the new world order."

Casra heard clapping and wooing from some people behind him at the fire: his hired band of hypemakers. Thi realized now that the danger Kipnu was referring to was much heavier than he let on. But thi was surprised by the sound of his voice.

"I came here just yesterday, a doctor from Heiko," Kipnu interjected. His words were like an offering: humble and in earnest. "Like all of you, I was untrusting, afraid of the dark. I was captured by one of Shinna's thugs, drugged with Kanosin, then put up for sale to the highest bidder. But Casra set me free. Thi showed me what this place could be if we only fought to change it for the better. You are free to follow this man, but there lies great danger."

Casra took his hand, accepting his apology.

"This your new boyfriend, Casra?" said the man. He scoffed as he looked Kipnu up and down, but Kipnu didn't pay him any mind. Casra's plan was more important than putting this man in his place.

Casra continued speaking to the crowd with a rallying cry, "The Great Pavilion can be a safe haven for all of us. But we must fight to make it so. If you would join us, then dry your clothes and finish your bread. For those who choose not to join us, may fate be gentle to you."

The people began to hum and murmur with activity with Casra and the man standing in the middle.

"Ramne," thi said, "How long have you been a kano peddler? The wind told me you left before your sentence was up, yet here you are again."

"Casra, you know what I'm here for. And now that I've got you cornered, I imagine I'll be getting a sweet sweet bonus."

"More kano? It's really that simple for you?"

"How do I say it? Life is good on the other side of poverty. Though you wouldn't know anything about that, would you?"

Casra looked at the maman behind him, "Seems you've found someone new, then."

"I couldn't possibly sell it all on my own." He said casually.

Casra looked around at the crowd, eyeing the rest of his crew. They were nearly eight in number, too much for Kipnu and haeself. Kipnu sensed this too, and spoke to hae aside.

"Could be an ambush," he said. "Let's get going before it's too late."

"Go. Protect Linyu," Casra asked him.

"I can't leave you here-"

"Do it!" thi snapped, still under hae breath.

Ramne's group began to stand up and he knew what would come next if he didn't do as thi said. Kipnu wasted no more time, hurrying over to Linyu who was sitting around a fire, never taking his eyes off of the two of them.

"Don't worry," said Ramne. "I'm not after Linyu. Thi's not worth anything to me."

"Thi's said the same of you. If you're going to take me, then get to it."

Ramne made a thunderous grunt, and the others echoed it back and fell into formation, trapping Casra in a circle. Thi didn't flinch or cower down, but just kept hae sights on Linyu.

"Mama!" Linyu called for hae mother. Thi tried to run after hae, but was stopped by a long dagger held by a maman twice Kipnu's weight in muscle - another of Ramne's allies.

"Stop!" The maman in black wasted no time running toward the warrior. "Thi's just a kaln."

Casra said to Ramne, "I hope your maman is as disappointed in you as I am."

He was expressionless as they walked into the forest.

"Thi won't be so disappointed when thi's indulging the blue."

Kipnu clenched his teeth as he saw the band of thugs whisk Casra off into the forest with a few stragglers from the beach in tow. The thought of what Shinna might do to hae disturbed him deeply. As they disappeared into the dark, he looked back at the crowd that remained on the shoreline. The maman who tried to stop Ramne was still amongst them, unsure of whether to follow Ramne or stay behind and a teary-eyed Linyu was fighting all hae instincts to run after hae mother. The rest were now all silently looking at him as if suddenly aware of the dangers of this place. Kipnu never asked for this, but now he found himself chasing a dream for a person he had only just met, and it had become the most important thing in his life.

"I... am Kipnu," he said to the crowd, "And Casra is a dear friend."

A tear came to his eye as he looked at Linyu, who had returned hae focus to him. _"Protect Linyu,"_ Casra's request resounded in his head.

"Know this. The Great Pavilion is not a prison, it is a slave cartel. Wherever you go here, you cannot escape from its reach. Right here... Right now... You've made a choice that will affect the rest of your lives. You've rejected a life of addiction, and you fight so that others may never know such a miserable fate."

"I choose to fight!" yelled a maman near him.

"I choose to fight!" yelled another. And person-by-person, the entire shore had galvanized in the red light of fire. Linyu held tightly to the satchel of listeners and thought of hae mother, a flame of hope still inside.
