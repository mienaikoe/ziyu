## Chapter 12


	"Are you sure they're landing here, Casra? I don't see any ships," asked Kip.

	"You can't see anything when it's this dark anyway. And yes, Zaenta will always follow the wind to get it done quicker. She's not real fond of her job, but she keeps the boat in one piece."

	"Sounds like you know her well."

	"I'm a traveler between Ulukoma and Shaki... I find friends in strange places."

	Kip looked out at the dark sea and the dark hint of red and infrared that lie above it. There was far more he could see now that his eyes adjusted, but the waves were still waves. Casra's face was the same expression he had come to expect from hae: calm, intelligent, and resolute. Whatever this plan was, he was certain thi had thought about it for many Ma'to.

	He reviewed the plan and glanced again into the bag of listeners he had been tasked to carry, wondering if Casra could really rally a resistance with something so small. Linyu was carrying bread and firestarters, and Casra the kanosin antidote. If he had been given a welcome such as this, Kip would likely have followed any plan thi had.

	"There, to the South," Linyu said. They immediately turned their heads and saw two silhouettes of boats and a huge crowd of people on each. Some swimmers were already flailing about in the water.

	"Quickly!" Casra yelled and they all ran toward the closest point on the shoreline. Kip pushed his bag to a startled Casra, and leapt into the icy sea of needles to save them.

  "I'm starting to wonder if he enjoys jumping into cold water," Linyu said.

  "He's a dreamer...and he wants to wake up," Casra replied.

  The cold of the sea bit at his limbs but he wasn't letting it bother him - these people needed his help. The pebble sea floor took him as far as it could, and then he began to swim toward that crimson red horizon. But before reached them, they had found solid footing and no longer needed help. His own feet, however, were starting to go numb and he realized that he was in a worse predicament than they were. He turned back toward the shoreline and made it to an area of solid footing before the water began to feel warmer, and his frustration had turned to fear. Breathing had become too difficult to call for help and everyone was too focused on getting to safety to notice that he was still behind them. His muscles started to spasm and lock up - first his legs, then his arms, then he started to sink.

	Casra sensed that Kip should have returned by now, and shot a glance out to the water where his head was barely breaking the surface. At a pace quicker than Linyu had ever seen hae run, Casra waded into the water and swam out to him. Thi locked hae arms around Kips' and pulled hard against the pebble floor. Kip was confused, but conscious of what was going on. When they made it to shore, thi set him nearer to the fire and laid underneath him, covering both of their bodies with pebbles just as he had done for Linyu.

  "C...Cas"

  "Shh. Just focus on getting warmer."

	His muscle control began to return and violent full-body shivers came along with it. He moaned in agony as feeling slowly returned from his core to his limbs, and Casra held him tighter so he wouldn't throw off too many rocks. An unexplainable frustration was building from his belly and circling inward and he let his mind be overtaken by it, wrestling free from Casra's grasp, and making a direct line for the trees. Casra stood up and dusted haeself off as the massive crowd of people looked on at them.

  "I'll be right back," thi said, and then trotted off to find Kip.

  Casra's voice was hushed, to keep the other from hearing much, "Kipnu, what's wrong?"

	"I'm fine," he said in an angry tone.

	"Come back and warm up. You're confused right now."

	"I said. I'm fine."

	Thi looked at him with a stern eye, but his own remained vacantly fixed on an invisible specter in the distance.

  After a tense moment, he turned around and asked, "Who the hell even are you, Cas? Why should I trust anything you have to say?"

  Casra grabbed his arm and leaned hae face into his.

  "You may have saved my kaln's life, but I just saved yours, so you might show some fucking gratitude," thi screamed, "This island isn't a playground for your ego. There are too many people who suffer here, whose lives would be destroyed if you make just one mistake. The last thing we need is a man who's out to save the universe. If you're going to be part of my tribe, you can'tâ€“"

  "I never asked to be part of your tribe, Casra," He said, wrestling free from hae grip. "I got roped into this mess because my only alternative was slavery."

  "And you don't think that's a fair trade? I risked my own life to give you freedom for a La'To. You don't think that's fair?"

	Thi shuffled about, trying to calm hae anger.

	She said, "I thought you would be the good kind of doctor, a real man of the people, that you would want an end to slavery in the Great Pavilion. But all you really want to do is take my radio back to Ara and be the big hero you always dreamed of being. Am I wrong? Tell me I'm wrong."

  "You know what, I don't even care what happens here," Kip replied. "In eleven days I'm getting off this dark prison island you call a home and heading straight for Heiko to save the only people that matter to me. That's the only problem that matters right now."

  "And what good would that be? Why save a people that throws away its own kin like trash for an addiction they can't control. That says to the people who built its railroads, 'You don't deserve the luxuries you created because you're an addict'? For me, I'd rather all under Ara freeze to death. Ulukoma will forge a new path in the dark."

	"And you would leave your binded to die too?"

	Casra cast her sights to the ground, and then looked up in a solemn gaze.

	"They've already done that to me," thi said.

	Thi turned around to return to the fire. Kip hesitated, but his anger had melted into humility, and he followed behind hae.

	Casra stopped just short of the fire, and looked out at crowd before hae. There were hundreds dotting the shore, huddled around multiple fires that had borrowed from the first. Linyu had run out of bread to pass out, so everyone was splitting pieces for each other, and huddling to keep warm.

	Thi stood on a rock and called out for quiet before addressing them.

	"Mamen, Women, Men. My name is Casra, and I'm a doctor here on Ulukoma. There are far more of you here today than we have ever had before."

	A voice called out from the crowd, "Ara is dying!"

	Another yelled, "This is the only safe place!"

	A clamor erupted, and Casra and Kipnu began to realize the weight of the news of the obstruction. Casra raised hae hands to calm the noise and spoke again, "I too, have been informed of the obstruction at Ara, and I wish I could tell you that you are safe here, but there is a tribe in the center of this island that would enslave you all if they could. If you want to survive, you will all have to fight for your freedom."

	"Why should we trust you?" asked another.

	Kip moved forward to stand by Casra's side.

	"I came here just yesterday. Like all of you, I was untrusting, afraid of the dark. I was enslaved and drugged with Kanosin. I did things I will regret forever, for a ruler I never thought could be so ruthless. I was put up for sale as a slave, but Casra saved me and showed me hae past and hae plans for the future. You can choose to follow your own path, but consider my story a warning of what could happen if you do."

	Casra took his hand as a gesture of gratitude and solidarity.

	Thi continued, "The Great Pavilion can be a safe haven for all of us. But we must fight to make it so. If you would join us, then dry your clothes and finish your bread. We hike East in a Va'ma. For those who choose not to join us, may fate be gentle to you."

	The people returned to talking, and Casra began to approach a fire when a man from the back started cackling.

	"Fate be gentle! Hahaha" He laughed to the wind as he reclined next to the fire. Thi shot hae eyes to him and stared, wondering what he could have been talking about. A young woman, quite a bit younger than him and dressed in a tight black robe, tugged on his arm to stop but he twisted free of her grasp and pushed her away.

	He stepped forward into the center and continued, "Casra, you fool. Lissa grants the wishes of those who earn the right to have them. These slaves, you call them, they're lazy and they're wicked. Lissa did what you were too weak to do."

	Casra had walked to the space that he was standing in, in between three fires. Thi saw the woman who had pulled on his arm approaching as well. Casra said to her, "It's okay," and she stopped and stood at a distance.

	"Ramne. How long ago was it when you betrayed me to peddle kano for Lissa? The wind told me you mysteriously left before your sentence was up, yet here you are again. Had enough of destroying lives and families?"

	"Ah, Casra, the rich kaln who couldn't lead a tribe to lunch. You know what I'm here for. And now that I've got you cornered, I imagine I'll be getting a sweet sweet bonus."

	"More kano? It's really that simple for you?"

	"How do I say it? Life is good on the other side of poverty. Though you wouldn't know anything about that, would you?"

	The maman begged him to stop, "Ram... Stop this."

	Casra interrupted, "Seems you've found someone new, then."

	"For a product this good? I couldn't possibly sell it all on my own." He said casually.

	Casra looked around at the crowd, searching for who else might be working with him, but couldn't spot anyone in particular.

	Kip sensed this too, and leaned in to whisper to hae, "Could be an ambush. You'd better stop this blabbering soon."

	"Go. Protect Linyu," Casra asked him.

	"I can't leave you here-"

	"Do it!" thi snapped, still under hae breath.

	Kip made haste toward the treeline, where Linyu was sitting around a fire, never taking his eyes off of hae.

	"Don't worry, I'm not after Linyu. Thi's not worth anything to me."

	"And yet you would humiliate me in front of hae? If you're going to take me, then get to it."

	Ramne made a thunderous grunt, and ten others from around the shoreline stood up and echoed it back, trapping Casra in a throngian cage. Thi didn't flinch or cower down, but just kept hae sights on Ramne. Linyu called for hae mother and started running towards them with Kip following after, but they were both stopped in their tracks by a long dagger held out by a maman twice Kip's weight in muscle - one of Ramne's allies. The woman in black wasted no time running toward the warrior, screaming for hae to save the kaln.

	Casra said to Ramne, "I hope thi is as disappointed in you as I am."

	He was expressionless as he bound Casra's unfighting arms behind hae.

	"Thi won't be so disappointed when thi's higher than Ara."

	Kip clenched his teeth as he saw the band of thugs whisk Casra off into the forest to bring hae to Lissa. He winced at the thought of what Lissa might do to hae. As they disappeared into the dark, he looked back at the crowd covering the shoreline. The woman who tried to stop Ramne was still amongst them, seeking pity from the ground, and a teary-eyed Linyu was fighting all hae instincts to run after hae mother. The rest were now all silently looking at him as if afraid that what just happened might happen to them. He never asked for this, but now he found himself chasing a dream he had only just known for a person he had only just met, and it had become the most important thing to him.

	"I... am Kipnu," he said to the crowd, "And Casra is a dear friend."

	A tear came to his eye as he looked at Linyu, who had returned hae focus to him. *"Protect Linyu,"* Casra's request resounded in his head.

	"Know this. The Great Pavilion is not a prison, it is a slave cartel. Wherever you go here, you cannot escape from its reach. Right here... Right now... You must make a choice that will affect the rest of your lives. Do you resign yourself to a life of addiction and slavery, or do you reject it and fight so that others may never know such a miserable fate? Do you surrender to kanosin, or strive for the dream of something far greater?"

	"I choose to fight!" yelled a maman near him.

	"I'll fight!" yelled another. And person-by-person, the entire shore had galvanized in the red light of fire. Linyu held tightly to the satchel of listeners and thought of hae mother with a flame of hope still inside.
