## Chapter 12

"Are you sure they're landing here?" he asked. "I think we came in from over there."

"I'm sure of it. Nanta decides which way to turn depending on the currents. She's not real fond of her job, but she keeps the boat running smoothly."

"Sounds like you know her well."

"I'm one of the few voluntary travelers between Ulukoma and Rudjan these days... Tends to raise a few eyebrows."

Kipnu looked out at the dark sea and the hint of red and infrared that lie above it. There was far more he could see now that his eyes had adjusted to the dark, but the waves were still waves and the rail was still rail. He wondered at Casra's stoic nature, how thi held the same expression no matter the hardship: calm, intelligent, and resolute. However this plan turned out, he was certain that a better one didn't exist.

He glanced again at the tank of fresh water he had been tasked to carry and his eyes wandered to Casra's satchel of kanosin antidote, and Linyu's satchel of hot tips and listeners. He wondered if thi could really start a resistance with something so small, but then he remembered that life under Shinna was a struggle and that gestures of kindness were rare. If he had been given such a warm welcome after such a harsh goodbye, he would have followed hae anywhere.

"There, a bit to the North," Linyu said. They strained their eyes to see two ships on the horizon nearing the end of the rails.

"Two ships?" asked Casra, incredulously. Kipnu was just as confused as thi was.

They drew closer, and the front ship began its turning maneuver. A huge crowd of people was thrown off the side all at once, all without bindings on their arms, and they flailed about in the water struggling to float in the disturbance.

"Quickly!" Casra yelled and the three ran toward the closest point on the shoreline where Linyu ran toward the treeline to gather wood and make a fire. Kipnu pushed his bag to a startled Casra, and leapt into the icy sea.

The cold of the water bit at his limbs but he wasn't letting it bother him - these people needed his help. The pebble sea floor took him as far as it could, and he kicked up to swim toward that crimson red horizon. But before could reach them, the second boat began keeling, pouring more people out into the water – many with tied hands. He reached one man who was gasping in shock at the cold water, showing signs of confusion.

"On your back!" Kipnu yelled at the man, but he didn't respond. Kipnu latched their arms together, and began swimming backward toward the shore until a woman came upon them.

She yelled between waves, "I've got him. There's a girl. Second boat. Arms tied."

Kipnu understood her, and swam back out to find the child, but he didn't see any signs of struggle. His feet were starting to go numb: the beginning of hypothermia. But he ignored it. He took a deep breath and dove under the water, opening his eyes despite the sting. He gained depth until he saw the faint glow of two blue eyes upon the sea floor. The distance was quite long at this point, so he surfaced to catch his breath before diving again. Five strokes, ten strokes, twenty. His breaths were straining as her eyes receded further into the deep. Thirty. He had to turn back. But he was so close now. Patches of color began to fill his vision and his muscles started to spasm and lock up - first his legs, then his arms, and then he started to sink.

A hand grabbed his shirt, tugged to pull him out, and he watched her eyes recede into the deep as the light of Ara returned to his vision.

The woman was in a canoe with the confused man while he sensed that Casra was with him in the water. Kipnu was confused, but conscious of what was going on. Casra lifted Kipnu as the woman pulled him onto the canoe and nestled him lengthwise into the middle of the boat.

"She's... still down there," he said, between deep breaths.

"It's too dangerous," said Casra. "I barely made it to you. I couldn't go further."

"No," he said. "I can... I can–"

"She's gone," said the woman sternly.

He fell silent at her voice, and continued to do so as they pulled some of the stragglers to the side of their boat and untied their arms. Kipnu had never seen such wanton carelessness for life before. If not for their canoe and preparations, surely hundreds more could have died or fallen gravely ill. And who were the people on the first ship? With their ands were unbound, and the deck swollen with their numbers?

Their boat made it to shore, and Casra lifted Kipnu out and set him near to the fire. Thi laid underneath him to give him warmth just as he had done for Linyu.

"C...Casra"

"Shh. Just focus on getting warmer."

His muscle control began to return and violent full-body shivers came along with it. He moaned in agony as feeling slowly returned to his limbs and his digits. An unbending rage began to build; first from his belly then circling around him and back inward, and it overtook his mind. That girl had a name, had a family, how could Shaki be so callous!

He wrestled free from Casra's grasp, and made a direct line for the trees. Casra stood up and dusted haeself off as the massive crowd of people looked on at them.

"We'll be back," thi said, and trotted off after Kipnu.

"Kipnu, what's wrong?"

"I need a moment," he said in an angry tone.

"Come back and warm up. You're confused right now."

"I said. I'm fine."

Thi moved into his line of sight, looked at him with a stern eye, but his own remained vacantly fixed inward.

"I was this close to saving her. Then you pulled me out."

Casra grabbed his arm and leaned hae face into his.

"You weren't going to save shit," thi said. "You were going to die."

He was snapped from his cloud of frustration by the tone of hae voice. He hadn't heard this side of hae before.

"You're acting like a child; like every risk is worth taking if it means you'll win. But there are people behind those risks, people who need you to stay alive. Maybe you're not the hero you want to be, Kipnu, but you can still be a good man."

Kipnu responded with a voice subdued but not wholly defeated.

"I know my limits, Casra. I could have saved her."

He wrestled free from hae grip.

"If you didn't want my help, you should never have plucked me from that sale."

"Are you listening to yourself? You're telling me you'd have rather been a mindless drone for Shinna than to be more calculated with your risks."

"Why should I even care what happens here?" he said. "You found me a boat. I'm getting off this dark prison island you call a home and heading straight for Heiko to save the only people that matter to me. That's the only problem that matters to me right now."

Casra was hurt, but thi didn't let it show.

"You can go if you want. You've already tried to waste your life. This time you won't have me to stop you."

Thi turned around to return to the fire.

"What I do with my life is up to me!" Kipnu yelled. But his anger had suddenly melted into humility and he regretted what he'd said.

Thi did not stop. Thi did not turn around.

<!--
"And you don't think that's a fair trade? Your freedom for your help?"

Thi shuffled about, trying to calm hae anger.

He hesitated.
 And what good would that be? Why save a people that throws away its own kin like trash for an addiction they can't control. That says to the people who built its railroads, 'You don't deserve the luxuries you created because you're an addict'? For me, I'd rather all under Ara freeze to death. Ulukoma will forge a new path in the dark."

Casra stood with Linyu just near a young campfire, and looked out at crowd before hae. There were hundreds dotting the shore, huddled around multiple fires that had borrowed from the first. Linyu had run out of bread to pass out, so everyone was splitting pieces for each other, and huddling to keep warm.

Thi stood on a rock and called out for quiet before addressing them.

"Mamen, Women, Men. My name is Casra, and I'm a doctor here on Ulukoma. There are far more of you here today than we have ever had before."

A voice called out from the crowd, "Ara is dying!"

Another yelled, "Nowhere is safe!"

A clamor erupted, and Casra and Kipnu began to realize the weight of the news Kipnu had withheld from them. Casra raised hae hands to calm the noise and spoke again, "I wish that I could tell you that you are safe here, but there is a tribe in the center of this island that would enslave you all if they could. If you want to survive, you will all have to fight for your freedom."

"Fate be gentle! Hahaha," a man cackled at her. He was standing near a fire with the trees behind him and he laughed to the wind as if he himself was king of Ulukoma. A maman not much older than Linyu and dressed in a tight black robe tugged on his arm to stop, but he twisted free of hae grasp and pushed hae away.

He stepped closer to the Casra, venturing into the light between fires and continued, "Casra, you fool. Shinna grants the wishes of those who have earned the right to have them. These slaves, you call them, they're lazy and wicked. Shinna did what you were too weak to do."

Kipnu, having followed Casra out of the forest moved forward to stand by hae side.

"I came here just yesterday. Like all of you, I was untrusting, afraid of the dark. I was captured by one of Shinna's thugs and drugged with Kanosin. I did a thing I will regret forever and I was put up for sale to the highest bidder, but Casra saved me. Thi showed me hae past and hae plans for the future. You can choose to follow your own path, but consider my story a warning of what could happen if you do."

Casra took his hand, accepting his apology.

<!-- left off -->

Thi continued, "The Great Pavilion can be a safe haven for all of us. But we must fight to make it so. If you would join us, then dry your clothes and finish your bread. We hike East in a Va'ma. For those who choose not to join us, may fate be gentle to you."

The people returned to talking, and Casra began to approach a fire when a man from the back started cackling.

Casra had walked to the space that he was standing in, in between three fires. Thi saw the woman who had pulled on his arm approaching as well. Casra said to her, "It's okay," and she stopped and stood at a distance.

"Ramne. How long ago was it when you betrayed me to peddle kano for Shinna? The wind told me you mysteriously left before your sentence was up, yet here you are again. Had enough of destroying lives and families?"

"Ah, Casra, the rich kaln who couldn't lead a tribe to lunch. You know what I'm here for. And now that I've got you cornered, I imagine I'll be getting a sweet sweet bonus."

"More kano? It's really that simple for you?"

"How do I say it? Life is good on the other side of poverty. Though you wouldn't know anything about that, would you?"

The maman begged him to stop, "Ram... Stop this."

Casra interrupted, "Seems you've found someone new, then."

"For a product this good? I couldn't possibly sell it all on my own." He said casually.

Casra looked around at the crowd, searching for who else might be working with him, but couldn't spot anyone in particular.

Kipnu sensed this too, and leaned in to whisper to hae, "Could be an ambush. You'd better stop this blabbering soon."

"Go. Protect Linyu," Casra asked him.

"I can't leave you here-"

"Do it!" thi snapped, still under hae breath.

Kipnu made haste toward the treeline, where Linyu was sitting around a fire, never taking his eyes off of hae.

"Don't worry, I'm not after Linyu. Thi's not worth anything to me."

"And yet you would humiliate me in front of hae? If you're going to take me, then get to it."

Ramne made a thunderous grunt, and ten others from around the shoreline stood up and echoed it back, trapping Casra in a cage of pangum. Thi didn't flinch or cower down, but just kept hae sights on Ramne. Linyu called for hae mother and started running towards them with Kipnu following after, but they were both stopped in their tracks by a long dagger held out by a maman twice Kipnu's weight in muscle - one of Ramne's allies. The woman in black wasted no time running toward the warrior, screaming for hae to save the kaln.

Casra said to Ramne, "I hope thi is as disappointed in you as I am."

He was expressionless as he bound Casra's unfighting arms behind hae.

"Thi won't be so disappointed when thi's higher than Ara."

Kipnu clenched his teeth as he saw the band of thugs whisk Casra off into the forest to bring hae to Shinna. He winced at the thought of what Shinna might do to hae. As they disappeared into the dark, he looked back at the crowd covering the shoreline. The woman who tried to stop Ramne was still amongst them, seeking pity from the ground, and a teary-eyed Linyu was fighting all hae instincts to run after hae mother. The rest were now all silently looking at him as if afraid that what just happened might happen to them. He never asked for this, but now he found himself chasing a dream he had only just known for a person he had only just met, and it had become the most important thing to him.

"I... am Kipnu," he said to the crowd, "And Casra is a dear friend."

A tear came to his eye as he looked at Linyu, who had returned hae focus to him. _"Protect Linyu,"_ Casra's request resounded in his head.

"Know this. The Great Pavilion is not a prison, it is a slave cartel. Wherever you go here, you cannot escape from its reach. Right here... Right now... You must make a choice that will affect the rest of your lives. Do you resign yourself to a life of addiction and slavery, or do you reject it and fight so that others may never know such a miserable fate? Do you surrender to kanosin, or strive for the dream of something far greater?"

"I choose to fight!" yelled a maman near him.

"I'll fight!" yelled another. And person-by-person, the entire shore had galvanized in the red light of fire. Linyu held tightly to the satchel of listeners and thought of hae mother with a flame of hope still inside.
