## Chapter 12


	"Are you sure they're landing here, Casra? I don't see any ships," asked Kip.

	"You can't see anything when it's this dark anyway. And yes, Zaenta will always follow the wind to get it done quicker. She's not real fond of her job, but she keeps the boat in one piece."

	"Sounds like you know her well."

	"I'm a traveler between the Shadestead and Shaki... I find friends in strange places."

	Kip looked out at the dark sea and the dark hint of red and infrared that lie above it. There was far more he could see now that his eyes adjusted, but the waves were still waves. Casra's face was the same expression he had come to expect from hae: calm, intelligent, and resolute. Whatever this plan was, he was certain thi had thought about it for many Ma'to.

	He reviewed the plan and glanced again into the bag of earrings he had been tasked to carry, wondering if something this small could really make sound out of thin air. Linyu was carrying bread and firestarters, and Casra the kanosin antidote. If he had gotten a welcome such as this, Kip would likely have followed any plan thi had.

	"There, to the South," Linyu said. They immediately turned their heads and saw a silhouette of a boat and some swimmers already flailing about in the water.

	"Quickly!" Casra yelled and they all leapt toward the shoreline. Kip pushed his bag to a startled Casra, and leapt into the icy sea of needles to save them.

  "I'm starting to wonder if he enjoys jumping into cold water," Linyu said.

  "He's a dreamer...and he wants to wake up," Casra replied.

  The cold of the sea bit at his limbs but he wasn't letting it bother him - he was called to help. The pebble sea floor took him as far as it could, and then he began to swim toward that crimson red horizon. But before he got to them, they had reached solid footing and no longer needed help. His feet, however, were starting to go numb and he took that as a sign that he needed to get quickly. He reached an area of solid footing before the water began to feel warmer, and his frustration turned to fear.

  Casra and Linyu were too busy starting a fire and passing out bread to notice that he was still in the water. He felt his muscles start to spasm and lock up - first his legs, then his arms, then he managed to get out a few yelps before his lungs started to do it. Casra sensed that Kip should have returned by now, and shot a glance out to the water where thi saw his head, barely above the water. At a pace quicker than Linyu had ever seen hae run, Casra waded into the water to pull Kip out by his armpit, and drag him nearer to the fire. She laid underneath him and covered both of their bodies with pebbles just as he had done for Linyu.

  "C...Cas"

  "Shh. Just focus on getting warmer."

  His muscle control began to return and then he felt an unexplainable frustration building from his belly and circling inward. He let his mind be overtaken by it and he wiggled free from Casra's grasp, making a direct line for the trees. Casra stood up and dusted haeself off as everybody's eyes were on hae.

  "I'll be right back, everyone," thi said, and then trotted off to find Kip.

  "Something eating you, Kipnu?" she asked, disappointedly.

  "I'm fine," he lied.

  "Kip, cut your crap. You jumped into that water like you were *trying* to die of hypothermia. Either you have an over-inflated hero complex or you're trying to atone for something. Which is it?"

  "I told you I'm fine."

  Casra grabbed his arm and leaned hae face into his.

  "You may have saved my kaln's life, but I just saved yours, so you might show some fucking gratitude," thi screamed at him, "This island isn't a place for your ego to come out and play. There are too many lives at risk, too many things to fight for. The last thing we need is a man who thinks he can save everyone alone. If you're going to be part of my tribe, you can'tâ€“"

  "I never asked to be part of your tribe, Casra. I got roped into this mess because my alternative was to be a slave."

  "And you don't think that's a fair trade? Risking my own life to give you freedom for a La'To? I thought you would be a man of the people, that you would support me in bringing an end to slavery in the Shadestead. But all you really want to do is take my radio back to Ara and be the big hero you always dreamed of being. Am I right?"

  "I don't care what happens here. I am only here for 10 days and then I go back to Heiko to hopefully save the world. My focus is on solving the only problem that matters right now."

  "And what good would that be? Why save a world that's not worth saving?"
