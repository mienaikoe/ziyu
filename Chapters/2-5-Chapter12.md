## Chapter 12


	"Are you sure they're landing here, Casra? I don't see any ships," asked Kip.

	"You can't see anything when it's this dark anyway. And yes, Zaenta will always follow the wind to get it done quicker. She's not real fond of her job, but she keeps the boat in one piece."

	"Sounds like you know her well."

	"I'm a traveler between the Shadestead and Shaki... I find friends in strange places."

	Kip looked out at the dark sea and the dark hint of red and infrared that lie above it. There was far more he could see now that his eyes adjusted, but the waves were still waves. Casra's face was the same expression he had come to expect from hae: calm, intelligent, and resolute. Whatever this plan was, he was certain thi had thought about it for many Ma'to.

	He reviewed the plan and glanced again into the bag of earrings he had been tasked to carry, wondering if something this small could really make sound out of thin air. Linyu was carrying bread and firestarters, and Casra the kanosin antidote. If he had gotten a welcome such as this, Kip would likely have followed any plan thi had.

	"There, to the South," Linyu said. They immediately turned their heads and saw a silhouette of a boat and some swimmers already flailing about in the water.

	"Quickly!" Casra yelled and they all leapt toward the shoreline. Kip handed his bag to Casra, and took off into the water to save the weakest ones.
