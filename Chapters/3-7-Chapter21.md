# Chapter 21

The blockade was unbreakable. A line of ships, five rows wide with a staggered formation hugged the Heiko peninsula and continued onto land for as the darkness would reveal. There must have been nearly a thousand ships from every province, each with a crew hungry for blood and indifferent to reason. Perhaps they wanted someone to blame for the darkness, or a morsel of Heiko's food to be divided amongst them. Or simply the feeling of importance in that desert of fear. Whatever they told themselves to stay the course, they weren't prepared to leave.

A man who was extinguishing the fire had found Melna's bag and clothes and left them neatly beside her as she looked homeward from the railing, warmed by Shinna's coat. It was a small thing, but folding her pants and coat was an unexpected gesture of goodwill. She thanked him and gently moved the folded clothes off of her bag and rummaged through it to find the listener, which she put on right away. Any word from Liffa would certainly be welcome.

She didn't get fully dressed right away, but held her time letting her mind wander. When she was ready, she opened her bag again and removed the robes she had been carrying. This would be the last time she could fulfill her role as a senator, she figured. She would wear them proudly, protecting her homeland in one last stand of words against whichever of Holragi's sharks had come for dinner.

Shinna had stayed near her since the fire, knowing not to trust anyone else of hae crew with the assumption of good nature. Thi had given Melna a flat piece of sticky kelp cut to the size of her torso and suggested that she wear it. "For your wound," thi said, with as much heart as thi could muster from the depth of guilt, and Melna took it with gratitude. She disrobed from Shinna's coat to apply the makeshift bandage and change into her robes while Shinna looked away at hae crew. She moved quickly and proficiently. If these were her last moments in friendly company she didn't want to waste them getting dressed.

"Big project, this... blockade. You think any of your people will make it out?"

"I don't know," she said belaboredly, "I gave them as many messages as I could. I'm still not sure why they're after me."

"They like to keep their reasons hidden."

"Could I ask perhaps... a personal question?"

"Sure."

"Is it really fear that makes you tick? Is everyone really fighting for a chance to live in the desert?"

Shinna sighed as if to prepare to tell a long story. "When I was a young kaln, everything was simple. There were good people and bad people. Law and lawlessness. 'Us' and 'them'. You may be young for a senator, but you probably know by now that things aren't quite that simple. All your good intentions mean nothing when death is staring you in the eye. It could be holding you up by neck with a sword to your chest. Or slowly gnawing away at the bones of your starving children. Or it could be some weird dark things shutting off your source of warmth and life. If in this moment, you have a choice to let a million strangers die or everyone you love, you will always. Always. Choose the million."

<!-- Melna took a long pause pondering this thought. "If that is our fate," she said, "I can still buy us more time."

"More time for what?"

"Our people are clever. Somebody will have made a plan by now."

"Clever, maybe. But who will lead them? Someone like you is hard to come by."

"A good leader creates better leaders."

"Doesn't sound like anyone I know." -->

Melna finally got the robe setting nicely around her and called over her shoulder, "Shinna, Could you help me?"

Thi turned to see Melna turned away and her arms holding two soft white ropes behind her back.

She said to the side, "My jundmaman usually helps me with this part, but thi's a bit busy at the moment."

Shinna walked over and took up the top rope, eyeing the quality and length.

"Gently please," Melna said, "The wound is still fresh."

Thi tied it in a knot that only a sailor could know, both ornate in form and function, refraining from speech. Hae arms moved slowly through the stiff air, shame alone weighing them down. Liffa appeared from Melna's memory, helping her fasten her robes in the windowlight. And Kipnu nuzzling her in the doorway. And in a daydream she wished for it all again. To relive that day and tell them that it was okay and they had nothing to worry about.

"You know," she started to formulate why she disagreed with Shinna, "I loved once. Not long ago. I lost them trying to bring peace to the senate and prevent a famine. In the end it was worthless. Holragi's insatiable hunger brought us here: blockaded by half the world's army and navy while we struggle to flee for our lives from certain destruction. I want you to remember whatever happens here today. If what you say of love is truly what you all believe, then you will surely be next."

Thi finished fastening the last knot and Melna turned around to see that hae attention was pulled away by hae thoughts. Thi was considering what she had said, or so she hoped. An unfamiliar voice came in loudly on the listener, "Surfacing," and not a moment after, a woman from the top of the bow called out, "Ship approaching!" From the darkness of Ulu on the left side their ship, a great volume of water was split in two as a huge mass of steel lifted out of the water. From Melna's estimation it was nearly twice as long as Shinna's ship. The crew immediately sprung into action, taking in the sails and keeping a safe distance from the other boat. Three silhouettes appeared from a tower that protruded from the dark steel mass. Shinna shouted to them, "Hoy!" with a voice louder than three of Melna's loudest voices and a higher pitch that carried over the ocean's sounds. The three shouted back, "Hoy!" and the strange boat slowed to a halt at their closest point.

"What.. is that thing?" Melna asked hae.

"A metal behemoth. Half overwater, half under."

"What would they need with something like that?"

"It's a deterrent."

"For what? None of the navies of Palinan have an underwater ship."

Thi interrupted her, calling out to the people on the behemoth again, "Permission to board!"

"State your business!" one of the silhouettes spoke. She spoke with authority, "You should be at your posted position by now."

"We have the Heikoan!" Shinna replied.

The people on the tower were confused, so they sent someone down the tower and gestured to Shinna to hold steady.

"Don't go anywhere," said Shinna.

"Where have I got to go?" she replied.

Shinna disappeared into stowage, and Melna saw a dark figure emerge from the tower. It was cloaked in something heavy that nearly reached the floor, but Melna couldn't make out anything more about it. Bright white lights from the behemoth came on one-by-one, illuminating Shinna's ship. Shinna appeared from stowage and looked up at the lights, trying to find hae bearings, but caught sight of Melna's figure in the light, and ran to her with something in hae hand. Thi stopped very close to her and reached around her back to push something cold against her right arm.

"Take it," thi said abruptly.

"What is-"

"It's a knife. You'll need to defend yourself. Take it."

She was confused why thi was suddenly giving her a weapon, but she didn't hesitate to move her other arm to receive the small knife and its scabbard, and place it inside her robe at the top tie near her heart.

Shinna came forward and addressed the figure, "I am Shinna, captain of the third kelping ship of Rudjan. We request boarding to negotiate Melna's release."

The newest figure consulted with the speaking shadow, and she said, "Only the senator will board. There will be no negotiation."

"We were promised a placement in the new colony."

"We will confirm you when she boards."

"That's not good enough."

The two shadows spoke again and she responded, "You have one minute to comply or your boat is sunk."

The entire crew looked to Shinna who paused to wonder if they would really do such a thing. Maybe they had a way to fetch Melna after they sunk the ship. Her words were becoming truer with each passing minute and thi was scared of what that might mean. A man approached her and said, "What are you doing? Send her up!"

"Hold on," Shinna said calmly to him, and turned to address the silhouettes once more.

"I will board with Melna. I come unarmed."

The two spoke once more and said, "No more than you. We will search your person upon arrival."

Shinna turned to Melna with a smile and whispered, "You see that? That's why they made me captain."

Four of the crew members produced a wooden ladder and cantilevered it up and out to bridge the gap between ships. Shinna secured it and checked hae pockets for any extra weapons thi might have forgotten and proceeded first followed by Melna who was significantly more careful getting down. The lights followed them as they crawled over the ocean on that rickety ladder, and Melna caught a glimpse of slight details of the behemoth. It was indeed plates of steel with strong bolts all across the hull, and few if no portholes on the sides. There was no deck to speak of, just two towers that jutted out of the hull like tall trees searching for light. As she neared the top, Shinna had already arrived on the tower and was talking with the figure in the tower.

Thi said, "I'm not leaving her here."

The larger silhouette spoke "You certainly won't be leaving here then," and Melna knew it was Fajro.

Shinna said, "What do you mean?"

And all at once, Fajro reached into his jacket for a strange steel weapon and Melna screamed, "Shinna, run!"

Thi ducked and scrambled for Melna and a great blast cracked the air above them. Melna grasped for Shinna's arm as thi fell off the ladder into the tall gap, and it held strong as she used hae momentum to loft hae back onto the ladder behind her. Melna smelled burnt sulfur and soot as Fajro pointed the smoking hole of it at her head.

"Come, Melna," he said, "We have much to discuss."

Melna moved to the tower and knealed to block Shinna from his line of view.

"After you," she said to Fajro.

Shinna screamed, "No! Don't go! They'll kill you!", as hae crew had already begun reeling the ladder back in with hae on it. Melna knew her fate and anyone who tried to save her would become collateral. She watched as Shinna descended back to the safety of hae ship, and then followed Fajro down the long tube into the belly of that terrible beast.

The inside was lit with stale yellow incandescent bulbs that brought its warmth neither to the dark matte-gray walls nor to the worn pale wood that made the floor. The static on her listener had dulled to a whisper as Fajro led her down a meandering path through the many corridors that she was convinced was meant to scramble her sense of direction. But after much wandering they arrived at a large room with several people sitting at desks of knobs and buttons with wired listeners fastened to both of their ears. She wondered at the utility of the knobs and buttons, but knew that they were likely listening to a much more sophisticated permutation of what was around her own ear.

"Do you know why you're here, Melna?" Fajro asked her rhetorically, "And why now?" 

He didn't wait for an answer.

"Your jundsmaman is nearly to the place where we think the obscura are. I wanted you to see this in person. To see first-hand what kind of work you're trying to stifle. The future you envision is no future at all. It is stagnant, slow. Dead. In doing nothing, you submit yourself to the whims of the universe. A universe with infinite possibilities where one will eventually destroy you. My vision is one where we are no longer slaves to the chaos that lurks in the dark. We should own that chaos, transform it into something valuable."

"And kill anyone who stands in your way."

He laughed through his nose as a father might to his child, "Yes. The survival of our species depends on it. And I am certain you will choose to live long enough to see the triumph you almost prevented."






<!-- Melna paused on the ladder, feeling that Shinna would likely be in trouble if she didn't do something quickly. She got one foot onto the steel tower and got a strong hold of Shinna's left arm, tugging it to pull her back onto the ladder. Thi stumbled a bit and fell into the gap, but Melna's arm held strong from the tower, and hoisted her onto the ladder again. The crew on hae boat had already begun reeling the ladder back in with hae on it, doing their best to provide counterweight with her so far on the ladder and hae crying, "No! Let me back on that ship! Melna!" -->









Thi placed hae hands behind hae back, spread hae legs slightly, and stood in an old naval posture that Melna didn't quite understand. She looked around awkwardly as the rest of the crew saw Shinna and one-by-one followed hae in the same silent stance. Ramne, still nursing his burns, looked on in ridicule at the display until a maman standing next to him pulled him up by the arm to join. But instead of joining, he yanked his arm back and walked off to the stern of the boat.

The crew stayed in this state for a pause that felt sufficient to say their peace. Then Shinna shouted, "Oyy," to which the whole crew responded in unison, "Hah!" and resumed what they were doing.


<!--
"All done," thi said, and Melna turned around to face hae. Shinna's lantern lit both of their faces, hers adorned with strength, and haes filled with awe.

"You're the real deal, aren't you," thi said with quiet reverence.

"Shinna. I do not change when I put on a robe."

"No, žah-Melna," thi insisted. The honorific surprised her. "The robe is meaningless without you to fill it."

Melna smiled at hae with gratitude, "Thanks. I'll remember that."
