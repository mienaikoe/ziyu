# Chapter 21

The blockade was unbreakable. A line of ships, five rows wide with a staggered formation hugged the Heiko peninsula and continued onto land for as the darkness would reveal. There must have been nearly a thousand ships from every province, each with a crew hungry for blood and indifferent to reason. Perhaps they wanted someone to blame for the darkness, or a morsel of Heiko's food to be divided amongst them. Or simply the feeling of importance in that desert of fear. Whatever they told themselves to stay the course, they weren't prepared to leave.

A man who was extinguishing the fire had found Melna's bag and clothes and left them neatly beside her as she looked homeward from the railing, warmed by Shinna's coat. It was a small thing, but folding her pants and coat was an unexpected gesture of goodwill. She thanked him and gently moved the folded clothes off of her bag and rummaged through it to find the listener, which she put on right away. Any word from Liffa or Holragi would certainly be welcome.

She didn't get fully dressed right away, but held her time letting her mind wander. When she was ready, she opened her bag again and removed the robes she had been carrying. This would be the last time she could fulfill her role as a senator, she figured. She would wear them proudly, protecting her homeland in one last stand of words against whichever of Holragi's sharks had come for dinner.

Shinna had stayed near her since the fire, knowing not to trust anyone else of hae crew with the assumption of good nature. Thi had given Melna a flat piece of sticky kelp cut to the size of her torso and suggested that she wear it. "For your wound," thi said, with as much heart as thi could muster from the depth of guilt, and Melna took it with gratitude. She disrobed from Shinna's coat to apply the makeshift bandage and change into her robes while Shinna looked away at hae crew. She moved quickly and proficiently. If these were her last moments in friendly company she didn't want to waste them getting dressed.

"Big project, this... blockade. You think any of your people will make it out?"

"I don't know," she said belaboredly, "I gave them as many messages as I could. I'm still not sure why they're after me."

"They like to keep their reasons hidden."

"Could I ask perhaps... a personal question?"

"Sure."

"Is it really fear that makes you tick? Is everyone really fighting for a chance to live in the desert?"

Shinna sighed as if to prepare to tell a long story. "When I was a young kaln, everything was simple. There were good people and bad people. Law and lawlessness. 'Us' and 'them'. You may be young for a senator, but you probably know by now that things aren't quite that simple. All your good intentions mean nothing when death is staring you in the eye. It could be holding you up by neck with a sword to your chest. Or slowly gnawing away at the bones of your starving children. Or it could be some weird dark things shutting off your source of warmth and life. If in this moment, you have a choice to let a million strangers die or everyone you love, you will always. Always. Choose the million."

<!-- Melna took a long pause pondering this thought. "If that is our fate," she said, "I can still buy us more time."

"More time for what?"

"Our people are clever. Somebody will have made a plan by now."

"Clever, maybe. But who will lead them? Someone like you is hard to come by."

"A good leader creates better leaders."

"Doesn't sound like anyone I know." -->

Melna finally got the robe setting nicely around her and called over her shoulder, "Shinna, Could you help me?"

Thi turned to see Melna turned away and her arms holding two soft white ropes behind her back.

She said to the side, "My jundmaman usually helps me with this part, but thi's a bit busy at the moment."

Shinna walked over and took up the top rope, eyeing the quality and length.

"Gently please," Melna said, "The wound is still fresh."

Thi tied it in a knot that only a sailor could know, both ornate in form and function, refraining from speech. Hae arms moved slowly through the stiff air, shame alone weighing them down. Liffa appeared from Melna's memory, helping her fasten her robes in the windowlight. And Kipnu nuzzling her in the doorway. And in a daydream she wished for it all again. To relive that day and tell them that it was okay and they had nothing to worry about.

"You know," she started to formulate why she disagreed with Shinna, "I loved once. Not long ago. I lost them trying to bring peace to the senate and prevent a famine. In the end it was worthless. Holragi's insatiable hunger brought us here: blockaded by half the world's army and navy while we struggle to flee for our lives from certain destruction. I want you to remember whatever happens here today. If what you say of love is truly what you all believe, then you will surely be next."

Thi finished fastening the last knot and Melna turned around to look at hae and see that hae attention was pulled away by the thought of being sold off to Holragi.

"Ship approaching!" called a woman from the top of the tall bow, but Melna saw no sign of a ship. From the darkness on the port side of the ship, a great volume of water was split in two as a huge mass of steel lifted out of the water. From Melna's estimation it was nearly twice as long as Shinna's ship. The crew immediately sprung into action, taking in the sails and keeping a safe distance from the other boat. A few people appeared from a tower that protruded from the dark steel mass, and Shinna shouted to them, "Hoy!" with what sounded like three voices booming at once. They shouted back, "Hoy!" and the strange boat slowed to a halt at their closest point.

"What.. is that thing?" Melna asked hae.

"A metal behemoth. Half overwater, half under."

"What would they need with something like that?"

"It's a deterrent."

"For what? None of the navies of Palinan have an underwater ship."

Thi interrupted her, calling out to the people on the behemoth again, "Permission to board!"

"State your business. You should be at your posted position by now."

"We have the Heikoan!"

The people on the tower were confused, so they sent someone down the tower and gestured to Shinna to hold steady.

"Don't go anywhere," said Shinna.

"Where have I got to go?" she replied.

Shinna disappeared into stowage, and Melna saw a dark figure emerge from the tower. It was slightly heavyset and masculine. Bright white lights from the behemoth came on one-by-one, illuminating Shinna's ship.

"So it really is you," said the silhouette.

"It's been a while, hasn't it?"

Shinna appeared from stowage and looked up at the lights, trying to find hae bearings, but caught sight of Melna's figure in the light, and ran to her with something in hae hand. Thi reached around her back and pushed it against her right arm and Melna felt that it was cold.

"Take it," thi said abruptly.

"What is-"

"It's a knife. You'll need to defend yourself. Take it."

She was confused why thi was suddenly giving her a weapon, but she didn't hesitate to move her arm to receive the small knife and its scabbard, and place it between the bottom tie of her robe near her heart.

Shinna came forward and addressed the figure, "I am Shinna, captain of Rudjan kelping ship \#3. We request to board to negotiate Melna's release."

"Only Melna will board. There will be no negotiation."

"We were promised a placement in the new colony."

"You will receive it when she boards."

"That's not good enough."

"Would you rather we send your boat to the ocean floor?"

Thi paused, wondering if they would really do such a thing. Maybe they had a boat to fetch Melna after they sunk the ship. Her words were becoming truer with each passing minute and thi was scared of what that might mean.

"I will board with Melna. I will come unarmed."

The figure paused briefly and said, "No more than you. We will search your person upon arrival."

Shinna turned to Melna with a smile and whispered, "You see that? That's why they made me captain."

Two of the crew members produced a wooden ladder and cantilevered it up and out to bridge the gap between ships. Shinna secured it and checked hae pockets for any extra weapons thi might have forgotten and proceeded first followed by Melna who was significantly more careful getting down. The lights followed them as they crawled over the ocean on that rickety ladder, and Melna caught a glimpse of slight details of the behemoth. It was indeed plates of steel with strong bolts all across the hull, and few if no portholes on the sides. There was no deck to speak of, just two towers that jutted out of the hull like tall trees searching for light. As she neared the top, Shinna had already arrived on the tower and was talking with the figure in the tower.

Thi said, "I'm not leaving her side."

"You certainly won't be leaving here then," he said.

"What do you mean?"

<!-- Melna paused on the ladder, feeling that Shinna would likely be in trouble if she didn't do something quickly. She got one foot onto the steel tower and got a strong hold of Shinna's left arm, tugging it to pull her back onto the ladder. Thi stumbled a bit and fell into the gap, but Melna's arm held strong from the tower, and hoisted her onto the ladder again. The crew on hae boat had already begun reeling the ladder back in with hae on it, doing their best to provide counterweight with her so far on the ladder and hae crying, "No! Let me back on that ship! Melna!" -->









Thi placed hae hands behind hae back, spread hae legs slightly, and stood in an old naval posture that Melna didn't quite understand. She looked around awkwardly as the rest of the crew saw Shinna and one-by-one followed hae in the same silent stance. Ramne, still nursing his burns, looked on in ridicule at the display until a maman standing next to him pulled him up by the arm to join. But instead of joining, he yanked his arm back and walked off to the stern of the boat.

The crew stayed in this state for a pause that felt sufficient to say their peace. Then Shinna shouted, "Oyy," to which the whole crew responded in unison, "Hah!" and resumed what they were doing.


<!--
"All done," thi said, and Melna turned around to face hae. Shinna's lantern lit both of their faces, hers adorned with strength, and haes filled with awe.

"You're the real deal, aren't you," thi said with quiet reverence.

"Shinna. I do not change when I put on a robe."

"No, žah-Melna," thi insisted. The honorific surprised her. "The robe is meaningless without you to fill it."

Melna smiled at hae with gratitude, "Thanks. I'll remember that."
