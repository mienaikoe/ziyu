# Chapter 21

The blockade was unbreakable. A line of ships, five rows wide with a staggered formation hugged the Heiko peninsula and continued onto land for as the darkness would reveal. There must have been nearly a thousand ships from every province, each with a crew hungry for blood and indifferent to reason. Perhaps they wanted someone to blame for the darkness, or a morsel of Heiko's food to be divided amongst them. Or simply the feeling of importance in that desert of fear. Whatever they told themselves to stay afloat, they weren't prepared to leave.

A man who was extinguishing the fire had found her bag and her clothing and left them neatly beside her. It was a small thing, but folding her pants and coat was a degree of goodwill above the rest. She thanked him and didn't get dressed right away, but held her time looking toward the blockade and letting her mind wander. And then she gently moved the folded clothes off of her bag and opened her bag, removing her robes. This would be the last time she could wear her robes, she figured. She would wear them proudly, protecting her homeland in one last stand of words against whichever of Holragi's sharks had come for dinner.
 
Shinna had stayed near her since the fire, knowing not to trust anyone else of hae crew with the assumption of good nature. Thi had given Melna a flat piece of sticky kelp cut to the size of her torso and suggested that she wear it. "For your wound," thi said, with as much heart as thi could muster from the depth of guilt, and Melna took it with gratitude. She disrobed from Shinna's coat to apply the makeshift bandage and change into her robes,
 and Shinna looked away at hae crew. She moved quickly and proficiently. If these were her last moments of enjoyment she didn't want to waste them getting dressed.

"Big project, this thing. You think any of your people will make it out alive?"

"I don't know," she said belaboredly, "I gave them as many messages as I could from Rudjan. All I can do is buy them more time."

"More time for what?"

"Our people are clever. Somebody will have made a plan by now."

"Cleverness, maybe. But a leader like you is hard to come by."

"What kind of leader would I be if I didn't foster my replacements."

"Doesn't sound like any leader I know."

Melna finally got the robe setting nicely around her and called to Shinna, "Could you help me?" 

Thi turned to see Melna turned away and her arms holding two soft white ropes behind her back.

She said to the side, "My jundmaman usually helps me with this part, but thi's a bit busy at the moment."

Shinna walked over and took up the top rope, eyeing the quality and length. 

"Gently please," Melna said, "The wound is still fresh."

Thi tied it in a knot that only a sailor could know, both ornate in form and function, refraining from speech but hae sluggish, careful movements told of regret. Liffa appeared from Melna's memory, helping her fasten her robes in the windowlight.
