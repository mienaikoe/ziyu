# Chapter 21

The blockade was unbreakable. A line of ships, five rows wide with a staggered formation hugged the Heiko peninsula and continued onto land for as the darkness would reveal. There must have been nearly a thousand ships from every province, each with a crew hungry for blood and indifferent to reason. Perhaps they wanted someone to blame for the darkness, or a morsel of Heiko's food to be divided amongst them. Or simply the feeling of importance in that desert of fear. Whatever they told themselves to stay afloat, they weren't prepared to leave.

A man who was extinguishing the fire had found her bag and her clothing and left them neatly beside her. It was a small thing, but folding her pants and coat was a degree of goodwill above the rest. She thanked him and didn't get dressed right away, but held her time looking toward the blockade and letting her mind wander. And then she gently moved the folded clothes off of her bag and opened her bag, removing her robes. This would be the last time she could wear her robes, she figured. She would wear them proudly, protecting her homeland in one last stand of words against whichever of Holragi's sharks had come for dinner.
 
Shinna had stayed near her since the fire, knowing not to trust anyone else of hae crew with the assumption of good nature. Thi had given Melna a flat piece of sticky kelp cut to the size of her torso and suggested that she wear it. "For your wound," thi said, with as much heart as thi could muster from the depth of guilt, and Melna took it with gratitude. She disrobed from Shinna's coat to apply the makeshift bandage and change into her robes,
 and Shinna looked away at hae crew. She moved quickly and proficiently. If these were her last moments of enjoyment she didn't want to waste them getting dressed.

"Big project, this thing. You think any of your people will make it out alive?"

"I don't know," she said belaboredly, "I gave them as many messages as I could from Rudjan. All I can do is buy them more time."

"More time for what?"

"Our people are clever. Somebody will have made a plan by now."

"Clever, maybe. But a leader like you is hard to come by."

"What kind of leader would I be if I didn't foster my replacements."

"Doesn't sound like any leader I know."

Melna finally got the robe setting nicely around her and called to Shinna, "Could you help me?" 

Thi turned to see Melna turned away and her arms holding two soft white ropes behind her back.

She said to the side, "My jundmaman usually helps me with this part, but thi's a bit busy at the moment."

Shinna walked over and took up the top rope, eyeing the quality and length. 

"Gently please," Melna said, "The wound is still fresh."

Thi tied it in a knot that only a sailor could know, both ornate in form and function. Thi was refraining from speech and hae arms moved slowly through the stiff air, hae shame alone weighing them down. Liffa appeared from Melna's memory, helping her fasten her robes in the windowlight. And Kipnu nuzzling her in the doorway. And in a daydream she wished for it all again. To relive that day and tell them that it was okay and they had nothing to worry about. 

"All done," thi said, and Melna turned around to face hae. Shinna's lantern lit both of their faces, hers adorned with strength, and haes filled with awe.

"You're the real deal, aren't you," thi said with quiet reverence.

"Shinna. I do not change when I put on a robe."

"No, Å¾ah-Melna," thi insisted. Honorifics surprised her. "The senate robe is meaningless without you to fill it."

Thi placed hae hands behind hae back, spread hae legs slightly, and stood in an old naval posture that Melna didn't quite understand. She looked around awkwardly as the rest of the crew saw Shinna and one-by-one followed hae in the same silent stance. Ramne, still nursing his burns, looked on in ridicule at the display until a maman standing next to him pulled him up by the arm to join. But instead of joining, he yanked his arm back and walked off to the stern of the boat. 

The crew stayed in this state for a pause that felt sufficient to say their peace. Then Shinna shouted, "Oyy," to which the whole crew responded in unison, "Hah!" and resumed what they were doing.
