## Chapter 21

<!--
He leaned closer to her and pulled some things out of a pocket in his coat.

"Linyu left this for you."

He lifted his hand from his coat and produced a satchel, which Melna hesitantly took and opened. On the top were two thick ornamental vials in a disc shape with a reddish liquid inside them.

"What is in these vials?"

"A cure for the undying."

She looked at him for a moment, trying to interpret his meaning, but paused to continue digging into the satchel. At the bottom was a copper coil embedded in a wooden puck: the same that Linyu was fiddling with. The coil had been hastily tied to a round glass plate, with one long length of wire pointed outward and a flap of dry kelp covering the center. Gently closing the satchel, she quickly hid the gift away in her field pack, still confused.

"Why did Linyu leave these for me?" she asked, bewildered, "And who are you?"

"The wind speaks," he said mysteriously. "You must listen."

_Who was he?_ She took out the coil device he gave her and ran her fingers along the copper windings, imagining what such a strange thing might be for. She knew that train motors often had coils of wire, but this didn't appear to be a motor of any kind. It was too delicate and precise to be pushing anything. _The wind speaks? Who are you?_

The contours of Heiko center crept up on the horizon, stippled with the yellow-orange beacons of a hundred thousand lanterns burning through the darkness. She hadn't seen such a sight since her first twelfth harvest festival, in the time before the electric rails had come to Heiko. It was a welcome sight, regardless of the circumstances by which Melna was arriving. She knew that it meant they were awake.

Melna felt the muffled thud of a bag landing next to her, and looked up to find Panna standing above her.

"Your bag, žah-fidelant," thi said mockingly. Melna opened the singed flap of her bag and rummaged through it, finding her fidelant robes and garb still intact and folded neatly. Underneath them was Fanla's listener, a warm glass bottle of water, and a bundle of flat kelp ribbon.

Thi began to walk away, but Melna reached for hae tunic.

"Panna... sit with me."

Thi hesitated, looked around for conspicuous lookers-on, then chose a spot some distance away from Melna to avoid giving the wrong impression. Thi averted hae eyes as Melna disrobed from Shinna's coat. Through sharp pains and clenched teeth, she poured the water on her burns and began to wrap the kelp ribbon around her torso.

"Can't you go any faster, woman?" asked Panna.

"It would be a lot quicker with some help."

Panna looked at Melna with a half-lustful half-disgusted gaze that wasn't lost on Melna, and then thi shuffled over and took the bandages into hae own hands as Melna sat up straight with her hands above her head. Panna began quickly and roughly, making sure the kelp was tight and well-mended to each other piece. But Melna's face turned red and dewy; even the hardest of sailors knew when to stop.

"Thank you, Panna," said Melna after thi had finished tying the end. Her face was still flush with pain. Panna didn't respond, but went right back to hae spot a distance away.

When she was ready, Melna opened her bag again and removed the robes she had been carrying. This would be the last time she could fulfill her role as a fidelant, she figured. She would wear them proudly, in a symbolic stance against whichever of Holrag's sharks were coming for dinner.

Her hands moved gracefully and proficiently, recalling the movements from some unseen invisible part of her memory.

Melna finally got the robe setting nicely around her and called over her shoulder, "Panna, Could you help me with these waistropes?"

Thi turned to see Melna turned away and her arms holding two soft white ropes behind her back.

"My jundmaman usually helps me with this part, but thi's a bit busy at the moment."

"Fidelants can't even dress themselves, eh?"

"These are my last moments in friendly company. I don't want to waste them getting dressed."

Thi made the strange ticking sound with the tip of hae tongue again and walked over slowly, making sure that Melna knew thi was annoyed. Thi took the ropes lazily from her hands, and eyed the quality of the rope and length to work with.

"Gently please," Melna said, "The wound is still fresh."

"Big project, this... blockade," thi asked while starting a square knot. "You think any of your people will make it out?"

"I don't know," she said belaboredly, "Holragi has a far strong military presence. I don't know what we can do."

"Eh, those Holragi dogs don't care about their jobs. Everyone is enslaved to someone else out there."

"It's not the soldiers I fear. It's their children, their siblings, their friends and lovers. A soldier fights harder if there's something to lose." she said.

"I guess it's an even battle then."

Thi tried to tidy up the knot on her waist, but quickly found that nothing could right its skew.

"It's fine," said Melna, but Panna loosened the knot and tied it again to get it right.

"Shinna sees I tied a knot like this, thi'd throw a tantrum."

"What was that?" asked Shinna as thi approached the two.

"Ah, the maman of the hour," Panna said aloud.

"One more time, Panna, I swear."

"That's what you said last time. And the time before that–"

"And I fucking meant it now go clean up the mess from the fire."

Panna took a few steps back and fixed hae eyes squarely on Melna. "Probably got a few knobs to polish down there," thi said. Melna didn't pick up hae meaning.

"We're almost to the blockade. Are you ready?"

"Could I perhaps... ask a personal question first?"

"No," thi responded, but Melna continued anyway.

"Is it really fear that makes you tick? Is everyone really fighting for a chance to live in the desert?"

Shinna sighed as if to prepare to tell a long story. "When I was a young kaln, everything was simple. There were good people and bad people. Law and lawlessness. 'Us' and 'them'. You may be young for a fidelant, but you probably know by now that things aren't quite that simple. All your good intentions mean nothing when death is staring you in the eye. It could be holding you up by neck with a sword to your chest. Or slowly gnawing away at the bones of your starving children. Or it could be some weird sky dots shutting off your source of warmth and life. If you were given a choice to let a million strangers die or watch everyone you love freeze to death, you will always. Always. Choose your own."

Melna sat with what thi said, and vehemently disagreed in her mind. But she figured it was best if she kept her thoughts on the topic to herself.

"You think anyone in Heiko knows?" thi asked.

"We are a clever people," she said.

"Clever, maybe. But can anyone lead them right now? Someone like you is hard to come by."

"Heiko is full of astute planners, strong fighters, and persuasive leaders. But a truly great leader trains even better leaders for their inveitable absence."

"Doesn't sound like any leader I know."

Melna's memory conjured a memory of Liffa helping her fasten her robes in the windowlight. And Kipnu nuzzling her in the doorway. And in a daydream she wished for it all again. To relive that day and tell them that it was okay. That they had nothing to worry about.

"You know," she started to formulate why she disagreed with Shinna, "I loved once. Not long ago. I lost them trying to bring peace to the senate. In the end it was worthless. Holrag's insatiable hunger brought us here: blockaded by a superior force while we try to flee for our lives from certain destruction. I want you to remember whatever happens here today. If you truly believe that we are beyond saving, that all the worlds' nations and tribes must fend for themselves, then surely you will be next."

Shinna's attention had been pulled away by hae thoughts, and Melna took the moment to toss her satchel onto her shoulders again.

"Maybe you're right Melna," said Shinna. "Maybe they're leading us on. But the only other option is certain death."

"No. Not death," she said, grasping at hae hand. "A fight is not death."

"All the world against the Holragi? We'd be doing the obscura a favor."

A man from the top of the bow called out, "Ship approaching!" From the darkness of Ulu, a great volume of water was split clear in half as a huge mass of black steel breached the water. From Melna's estimation it was nearly twice as long as Shinna's ship, and some unfathomable length underneath. The crew immediately sprung into action, taking in the sails and stabilizing the rudder to avoid a collision.

Three silhouettes appeared from the towering dark and stood looking down at them. "Hoy!" Shinna shouted to them with a voice louder than any Melna had heard at the senate. But the phantoms didn't respond, they kept looking down and talking amongst each other.

"What.. is that thing?" Melna asked.

"A submersible. They float just below the surface to stay invisible. I've seen a few but never one this big."

"What would they need with something like that?"

"It's a deterrent."

"There's no ship in Palinan nearly that size. It's a weapon of conquering, not of defense–"

"Permission to board!" Thi interrupted her, calling out to the people on the submersible again. "We have the Heikoi!"

The people on the tower spoke amongst each other, and Melna saw their relationships. The left and right were soldiers by the stance and their armored look. And the person in the center was someone of status, giving orders and guiding the operation. With a simple gesture, one of the guards clambered down the tower on a ladder and gestured to Shinna to hold steady.

"Don't go anywhere," Shinna told her.

"Really?" she asked rhetorically.

Shinna disappeared into stowage, and Melna saw a new dark figure emerge from the tower. It was cloaked in something heavy that nearly reached the floor, but Melna couldn't make out anything more about it. Suddenly, bright white lights from the giant submersible began to flip on one-by-one, illuminating everyone on the deck in a cold blue-white light.

"How are they doing that?" Melna asked aloud. She looked up at the rails above her to make sure they hadn't strayed from path, but she knew they would be there. There was nothing but dread in her heart as she stared into the blinding light.

Shinna appeared from stowage with a hand at hae forehead, trying to find hae bearings. Thi caught sight of Melna's figure in the light and ran back to her with something hidden in hae hand.

"Take it," thi said abruptly, reaching around her back to push something cold against her side.

"What is-"

"You'll need to defend yourself. Take it."

She hesitated, confused.

"Take it!" thi said under hae breath, and Melna move her left arm to receive the small knife from behind her. It was covered in a waxed cloth, perfect to blend with the cloth she was wrapped in. She discreetly slipped it inside the bottom of her robe at an angle where she could reach it easily, and drew a circle of gratitude on Shinna's back with her finger.

Shinna came forward and addressed the soldier who had climbed down from the metal tower, "I am Captain Shinna. We request boarding to negotiate the fidelant's release."

But the people on the tower seemed to hear hae clearly. The cloaked figure spoke silently into an instrument, and the nearer soldier responded soon after.

"Only the fidelant will board. There will be no negotiation," he said.

"We were promised a position in the Red Circle."

"We will confirm you when she boards."

"That's not good enough," Shinna insisted.

The cloaked figure spoke again and the soldier responded accordingly. "You have one minute to comply or your ship will be destroyed."

The entire crew looked to Shinna who paused to wonder if they would really do such a thing. Melna's convictions were becoming truer with each passing minute and thi was scared of what that might mean.

<!-- left off -->

A member of the crew approached her. "What are you waiting for?" he said, anxiously. "Send her up!"

"Hold on," Shinna said calmly to him, and turned to address the silhouettes once more.

"I will board with Melna. I come unarmed."

The two spoke once more and said, "No more than you. We will search your person upon arrival."

Shinna turned to Melna with a smile and whispered, "You see that? That's why they made me captain."

Four of the crew members produced a wooden ladder and cantilevered it up and out to bridge the gap between ships. Shinna secured it and checked hae pockets for any extra weapons thi might have forgotten and proceeded first followed by Melna who was significantly more careful getting down. The lights followed them as they crawled over the ocean on that rickety ladder, and Melna caught a glimpse of slight details of the submersible. It was indeed plates of steel with strong bolts all across the hull, and few if no portholes on the sides. There was no deck to speak of, just two towers that jutted out of the hull like tall trees searching for light. As she neared the top, Shinna had already arrived on the tower and was being searched by the figure in the tower.

Thi had activated her scrappy old self. "I'm not leaving her here!" she said.

The larger silhouette spoke "You certainly won't be leaving here then," and Melna knew it was Fajro.

Shinna said, "What do you mean?"

And all at once, Fajro reached into his jacket for a strange steel weapon and Melna screamed, "Shinna, run!"

Thi ducked and scrambled for Melna and a great blast cracked the air above them. Melna grasped for Shinna's arm as thi fell off the ladder into the tall gap, and it held strong as she used hae momentum to loft hae back onto the ladder behind her. Melna smelled burnt sulfur and soot as Fajro pointed that smoking rod at her head. Melna moved to the tower and knealed to block Shinna from his line of view. Shinna screamed, "No! Don't go! They'll kill you!", as hae crew had already begun reeling the ladder back in with hae on it. Be she knew her fate. She knew that anyone who tried to save her would not be spared.

"First time seeing a gun, I take it," he said with an air of arrogance.

"Come, Melna," he gestured toward the hole he came out of. "We have much to discuss."

She looked back to make sure Shinna descended back to the safety of hae ship, then stood up and refocused her attention on the Holrag soldiers before her. Fajro smiled as he looked her up and down the way he might inspect a prize-winning saffa.

"You look like you turn a few heads in the senate," he said, eyeing her up and down. "It's a shame we never worked together."

"Truly a shame," she replied, "I could have turned your head right off."

His frown took a moment to form, and then he sighed and changed the subject, "Shall we?" as he gestured with his cane toward a plaform covering the hole in the tower they had come out of. Without protest, she stepped upon it with Fajro soon after and they descended into the belly of that mechanical beast.

The inside was a maze of tunnels with double doors at nearly every twenty paces, and walls lined with stale yellow incandescent bulbs that brought its warmth neither to the greased steel walls nor to the grey worn wood that made up the floor. They were cheap imitations of Ara-light that were nothing like the original. It disgusted her to imagine living here for several days, as undoubtedly many of those onboard had done.

The static on her listener had dulled to a whisper as Fajro led her down a meandering path that she was convinced was meant to scramble her sense of direction. But after much wandering they arrived at a large room with several people sitting at desks of knobs and buttons with wired listeners fastened to both of their ears and a protrusion on one side for what seemingly looked like a microphone. She wondered at the utility of the knobs and buttons, but knew that they were likely listening to a much more sophisticated permutation of what was around her own ear.

"Do you know why you're here, Melna?" Fajro asked her rhetorically, "And why now?"

He didn't wait for an answer.

"We are about to make history. Your jundsmaman is nearly at the obscurae. I wanted you to see this in person. To see first-hand what kind of work we're trying to do. You see, I dream of a day when we can look back on the obscura as just another problem we all managed to fix by working together. If we continue to do nothing, we submit ourselves to the will of the universe and it will eventually kill us as it is now."

He moved to stare closer to Melna's face. To make sure she was paying attention. But all she could think of was the odor of Heikoi grain glycol on his breath.

"Our vision is one in which we are no longer slaves to the chaos that lurks in the dark. We can own that chaos, transform it into something much greater than it is."

"And you'll ruthlessly murder anyone who stands in your way."

He laughed through his nose as a father might to his child, "Yes. The survival of everything on this planet depends on the success of this plan. Unfortunately, we don't have the time for debate. We only have the time to act."

"So, what's the offer?" she asked in her most diplomatic of voices. She wanted to catch him a little bit off guard.

"Always in a rush, you younger type."

"I know stalling when I hear it. Tell me how I fit into this plan of yours and I'll see what I can do."

"That's the spirit."

"Don't get me wrong, I still think you're a conniving bloodbeetle who gets off on watching others suffer. I just want to get this overwith."

"Now that's unfair."

"No, I get it. You want to be the one everyone remembers as their heroic savior. The man who thwarted the obscura and the evil Heikoi at the same time. You think that's how people think of you. But you don't know that they all secretly fear you. Wish you were gone. All you'll be remembered as is the man who destroyed a city for his own self-righteousness," she raised her voice to an increasingly flustered Fajro.

"You're being ridiculous. I wouldn't destroy a city. My legacy is written in steel."

"Yea? You think steel is all it takes? What do you think the steel will mean to the ones who are left? The slaves that built your rail, manned your army, did your bidding. What kinds of stories do you think they'll tell aboout you? What kind of shadows will lurk within the monstrosities you built out of the steel you value so dearly?"

"You're wasting your breath."

"No. I think they'll be too busy ushering in their new master to remember you."

"Are you do-?"

"You'll be dead to them. Replaced by a child of the revolution. Someone who promises to never again allow your atrocities see the light of day."

"You're not listen–"

"You'll beg and grovel for their attention, rotting in an underground pris–"

He took her by the neck and pinned her against the wall of the radio room to silence her, spitting to her, "You have no idea how sorry you'll be once you are forgotten. Your people will worship the stone that I tread, the air that I breathe. You'll wish you had died here."

Despite the parade of colorful sparks blotting her eyes, and the unproductive gasps for air, She gathered his words into a theme and then an understanding of his true intentions, and she managed to put on a smirk. Fajro looked around through labored breaths as his self-awareness gradually resurfaced, and he took his hand off of her, embarrassed that his crew had seen such a belligerent outburst from him. He was beginning to realize that she was a bit more cunning than he first believed.

A radio operator announced, "Žah-Fajro. Liffa is ready," and with a shake of his head and a furious look on his face, he approached the operator and yanked the longer listener from hae ears, sloppily raising the box up to his head and pressing a button on the outer face when he wanted to talk.

"Liffa. That you?"

Melna gasped for air but listened louder.

"Right," he said, "We have her here now. I'll put her on real quick."

"Bring her here, dammit!" he barked at the soldiers surrounding Melna. "What are you waiting for!"

One of them shoved her toward him, and he came uncomfortably close to her face to talk at her.

"Now, listen. This isn't catch-up time. You get a few conversations, thi acknowledges you're here and then you're done. Got it?"

She nodded coldly, and Fajro cued to the operator to flip a stiff brass switch. Suddenly a faint static entered the room, intimate clicking sounds painting the air. He gave the larger listener to Melna and waved with a hand for her to press a lever.

Melna mustered her mental strength, holding the listener in her left hand and shielding the microphone in the other. The lever sank and through a cracked voice she heard herself, "Liffa? Are you there?"

A moment passed and then my voice leapt into the room, "Melna. It's really you! Where are you? Why does your voice sound like that?"

"It's...a long story," she replied, "I'll tell you when you get back."

"Oh. Ok...," I replied, parsing her defeated tone. Another moment passed before Melna heard me, and she started to realize that it had something to do with the vast distance that my ship had traveled.

We paused, looking for something to say, but Melna knew she couldn't let the conversation go slack. She picked up again, "How's the weather where you are?"

I giggled at her joke, then felt a pang of longing for a simpler time.

"Cool and partly obscura-y," I said, covering my pain. "It's rather beautiful up here. I'll paint it for you someday."

"Yea," she said, "I'd like that."

I couldn't speak. Reality had sunk into me and sprouted.

"Liffa," she asked, "What about the wind?"

There was a pause on the line as everyone in the room seemed confused. Fajro reached for the listener, but Melna intercepted his hand and I responded, "I've heard it speaking close to home. From beyond the fog of war."

Melna tried to ask, "The fog of war?" but the operator had already pried her hands from the listener and the lever had been lifted before she could finish. "Liffa!" A soldier held her back as another picked up the listener from the floor and gave it to Fajro.

He yelled at Melna, "I don't know what you're up to, but it ends now!" and then immediately turned back to the microphone. "That's enough talk for now, Liffa. Let's get to work... What's that?... Oh she'll be fine. Let's just focus for now, okay?"

Fajro gestured to a man at the far side of the room, who approached her with a long, thick swatch of razor jute and placed it around her mouth while Fajro held her arms. She fought against him, but every movement against the mask stung her cheeks. The jute sunk into her mouth as he tightened the mask behind her head. Her cheeks flushed with perspiration but she held her tongue from causing further pain.

He said to her calmly, "You disrespect me, Melna. I didn't want to resort to this, but this is the only thing that will keep your schemes in check."

She stared at him intently, trying to figure out his angle. _He needs me,_ she thought. _He wouldn't put all this together and muffle me just to toy with me._

Fajro regained his stance, keeping Melna in the corner of his eye, and took up the microphone and listener again.

"Sorry about that, Liffa," he said to me. I was too confused to answer. "Now, if I'm not mistaken, you're about to pass to the other side of the obscura. Can you describe what you see around you?"

"Yes sir... I-I can see the obscura in closer detail now. It... looks a bunch of circles floating in space. They're all growing outward from their centers."

"Circles?" he paused to find his words, "How big are they?"

"Small. No larger than my own ship. But there are so many. More than I can count."

"Liffa... how far do they stretch?"

I paused, knowing the answer, but attempting to comprehend what I was seeing. "I... can't tell."

Fajro turned away fom Melna and spoke to me at a softer volume so Melna couldn't hear.

"Come on, Liffa. Tell me something more. Use your eyes."

"I can't see very far," I told the truth.

"What's the matter with your vision?"

"It's blurry, sir."

He was doubtful, but continued with me.

"Just tell me what you can see then."

"Well, I'm just a few thousand paces out now... I think I can see through a few of the cracks in the shapes... wait. No!"

"What's wrong?" He sounded legitimately concerned.

I peered through a crack and saw what I would never have expected. There were reflections from the other side of Ara. The wall covered the entirety of our star.

"This wall of shapes. It doesn't end. They're forming a sphere around Ara, and I'm headed straight into it."

"What?!" he said loudly. Melna heard the worry in this word along with the rest of the people listening in. He turned around to see everyone staring, and then went quiet again.

I continued, worried, "What. What do I do?"

"Liffa, could you hold, for one moment."

He took his finger off of the microphone lever and yelled across the room, "Kavva, how close is thi to the obscura"

"About 720 paces, sir," thi said.

He paused to take that in, disregarding my agitated silence. Under my breath, I was cursing as if seeing something genuinely horrifying. Melna had never known me to be in such a state, and it shocked her to hear.

He pressed on the lever of the listener again and said, "Yea Liffa, you're pretty close. Thing must be pretty big from where you are, but we have just about all we need, so I'm gonna let you go."

"Wait! What do I do?"

"I'll leave you to my engineer who will take you up to obscura, ok?"

"No. Wait, don't–"

But before I could finish, Fajro had switched off the speaker and the room went dead. From the corner of her eye, Melna glanced at the switch and at the people who sat near it, and saw that no one had any intention of turning it back on. She knew then that they were prepared to sacrifice me and her heart sank. That Fajro would kill to keep secret whatever horrors lie behind the veil of the obscura sickened her and she wanted to bring an end to his twisted game. But between the number of people in the room, and the vigilance of the crew, she surmised that she didn't stand a chance flipping it back off.

He put down the listeners and paused for a moment to think, switching his tone suddenly when he was ready to talk.

"Now that I have your attention, Melna. It's time to make a deal. I offer you the chance to save Liffa and join me in welcoming our hero back home from a glorious victory against the obscura."

"What's in it for you?" She asked coyly.

"All I ask is your allegiance. An address to the people of Heiko that the senate has chosen me as its leader."

"How stupid do you think I am?"

"You may doubt me when I say this, but that's all I've wanted from the beginning. The only hope for the future of our people is to unify."

"We are unified under the senate. We keep peace."

"The senate. Heh," he chuckled under his breath and began pacing back and forth. "The senate has no real power. It is a Milta diguised as a Tilmara. It convinces people to stay in line, to stay comfortable, to stay doomed. Peace is a veil, Melna. It shrouds our eyes to our true potential as a species. War, that's where heroes are made. Where civilization itself is tested."

"War is where civilization goes to die. Innumerable lives are lost and nothing is gained for anyone. The senate maintains peace because the alternative is senseless."

"The senate maintains peace for its fidelants to keep their jobs. None of them want any real change. They want to appeal to stronger members so the money can continue flowing in. They would never threaten anything. A war would lift the veil; would show the rest of the world how little their fidelants do for them."

"And you have the real power in Palinan, do you?"

"Well, frankly," he stopped and lifted his arms as if holding up the universe as evidence. "Yes."

She was unamused.

Fajro took one step toward her, letting the light illuminate the creases of his face and the grin that folded them. She looked up at his tall figure, contemplating the choice between leading her people into Fajro's twisted desires, and letting them die fighting him. But she knew her answer even before she had left Shinna's ship.

"I'll do it."

<!-- NOTES -->
<!--
Fajro gives Melna a chance to save Liffa and let Heiko die (weapons meant for obscura skip it and hit Heiko), or save Heiko(and the world) by killing Liffa (destroying the obscura). If she saves the world, she must submit her people to slavery. She chooses to kill Liffa (but the silence is a red herring).

Note: Having Liffa reveal that the obscura is an infinite wall would make Fajro desparate. His idea wouldn't work anymore, and he would no longer have a bargaining chip against Melna. Therefore he would see both Liffa and Melna as useless and kill them. It would also lead to the plan being ruined and hopeless, and Fajro being tempted to use the bombs on Heiko instead, since they're useless in the sky.

If Liffa lies instead, and says it's just a big rock in the way, Fajro will be swayed to detonate the bombs in the sky instead of on Heiko. This hinges on the fact that Liffa:
- knows there are bombs on her Trajectory
- could have calculated or heard from Setre that Heiko would be where they land.
  - Setre would have to know trajectories, which her army isn't trained to do.
  - Thimlu, Jesse, or Melna would have to tell hae somehow.

Tenets
- Liffa does not have knowledge of Linyu, Setre.
- Liffa does not know that bombs are coming.
- Melna decides their fate
- Melna values her people above all else, including Liffa.
  - This means she will choose to detonate in the sky
  - Fajro will recognize this as useless, and will realize they are powerless against such a powerful foe.
    - This pivot will lead to him to become sick with ambition. He will coerce Heiko to become slaves by any means.
    - Melna will be amenable to this because she has no other choice - her army isn't as strong, and they soon won't have homes. She wouldn't leave cards on the table, however. She executes a secret standoff at the pulpit, putting Fajro on the line to delivery on Liffa's mission. Liffa announces to Heiko that a better life awaits them beyond slavery, in the land of darkness. Melna sees Setre's ships barge in and yell's at them to charge into the fog. Fajro charges at her,

Melna thwarts an attempt to use Liffa as leverage against her because she knows bombing the obscura would be useless. Fajro forces her to speak to her people to tell them to become slaves to Holrag. She delivers a message on the shoreline with Fajro standing right next to her. She attempts to use the knife Shinna gave her to subdue Fajro and his soldiers. She wounds Fajro but a soldier wounds her fatally as she bleeds out.

Some are killed by ships on the surface with early guns, and Fajro's craft divides into several craft that hunt for Heikoi, but Shinna throws them a line with hae ship and Setre's fleet appear from the fog. Most make it to Setre's ships and sail to Ulukoma.

Melna's last sight is seeing her people safely outrun this giant blockade with a smile on her face.

<!-- Laen is found wrapped around Melna's body in the beginning of Linyu's part -->

<!-- Thi placed hae hands behind hae back, spread hae legs slightly, and stood in an old naval posture that Melna didn't quite understand. She looked around awkwardly as the rest of the crew saw Shinna and one-by-one followed hae in the same silent stance. Ramne, still nursing his burns, looked on in ridicule at the display until a maman standing next to him pulled him up by the arm to join. But instead of joining, he yanked his arm back and walked off to the stern of the boat.

The crew stayed in this state for a pause that felt sufficient to say their peace. Then Shinna shouted, "Oyy," to which the whole crew responded in unison, "Hah!" and resumed what they were doing. -->

<!--
"All done," thi said, and Melna turned around to face hae. Shinna's lantern lit both of their faces, hers adorned with strength, and haes filled with awe.

"You're the real deal, aren't you," thi said with quiet reverence.

"Shinna. I do not change when I put on a robe."
