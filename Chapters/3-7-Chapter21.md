# Chapter 21

Heiko crept up on the horizon gradually. A great clearing in the trees of Rudjan for as long as the eye can see, but you only know that the trees have fallen away when you've been in it for long enough. It was a welcome sight, regardless of the circumstances by which Melna was arriving. She was conditioned to feel more like herself within the arms of those rolling plains and the shorelines abutting them.

A man who was extinguishing the fire had found Melna's bag and clothes and left them neatly beside her as she looked homeward from the railing, warmed by Shinna's coat. It was a small thing, but folding her pants and coat was an unexpected gesture of goodwill. She thanked him and gently moved the folded clothes off of her bag and rummaged through it to find the listener, which she put on right away. Any word from Liffa would certainly be welcome.

She didn't get fully dressed right away, but held her time letting her mind wander. When she was ready, she opened her bag again and removed the robes she had been carrying. This would be the last time she could fulfill her role as a senator, she figured. She would wear them proudly, protecting her homeland in one last stand of words against whichever of Holragi's sharks had come for dinner.

Shinna had stayed near her since the fire, knowing not to trust anyone else of hae crew with the assumption of good nature. Thi had given Melna a flat piece of sticky kelp cut to the size of her torso and suggested that she wear it. "For your wound," thi said, with as much heart as thi could muster from the depth of guilt, and Melna took it with gratitude. She disrobed from Shinna's coat to apply the makeshift bandage and change into her robes while Shinna looked away at hae crew. She moved quickly and proficiently. If these were her last moments in friendly company she didn't want to waste them getting dressed.

"Big project, this... blockade. You think any of your people will make it out?"

"I don't know," she said belaboredly, "I gave them as many messages as I could. I'm still not sure why they're after me."

"They like to keep their reasons hidden."

"Could I ask perhaps... a personal question?"

"Sure."

"Is it really fear that makes you tick? Is everyone really fighting for a chance to live in the desert?"

Shinna sighed as if to prepare to tell a long story. "When I was a young kaln, everything was simple. There were good people and bad people. Law and lawlessness. 'Us' and 'them'. You may be young for a senator, but you probably know by now that things aren't quite that simple. All your good intentions mean nothing when death is staring you in the eye. It could be holding you up by neck with a sword to your chest. Or slowly gnawing away at the bones of your starving children. Or it could be some weird dark things shutting off your source of warmth and life. If in this moment, you have a choice to let a million strangers die or everyone you love, you will always. Always. Choose the million."

Melna paused her dressing routine and pondered whether Shinna meant she would save the million or kill the million. But she figured it was best if she kept her thoughts on the topic to herself.

"You think anyone in Heiko knows?" thi asked.

Melna resumed her careful enrobing technique.

"We are a clever people," she said. "And I've left enough hints."

"Clever, maybe. But can anyone lead them right now? Someone like you is hard to come by."

"A good leader produces even better ones."

"Doesn't sound like the leaders I know."

Melna finally got the robe setting nicely around her and called over her shoulder, "Shinna, Could you help me?"

Thi turned to see Melna turned away and her arms holding two soft white ropes behind her back.

She said to the side, "My jundmaman usually helps me with this part, but thi's a bit busy at the moment."

Shinna walked over and took up the top rope, eyeing the quality and length.

"Gently please," Melna said, "The wound is still fresh."

Thi tied it in a knot that only a sailor could know, both ornate in form and function, refraining from speech. Hae arms moved slowly through the stiff air, shame alone weighing them down. Liffa appeared from Melna's memory, helping her fasten her robes in the windowlight. And Kipnu nuzzling her in the doorway. And in a daydream she wished for it all again. To relive that day and tell them that it was okay and they had nothing to worry about.

"You know," she started to formulate why she disagreed with Shinna, "I loved once. Not long ago. I lost them trying to bring peace to the senate and prevent a famine. In the end it was worthless. Holragi's insatiable hunger brought us here: blockaded by half the world's army and navy while we struggle to flee for our lives from certain destruction. I want you to remember whatever happens here today. If what you say of love is truly what you all believe, then you will surely be next."

Thi finished fastening the last knot and Melna turned around to see that hae attention was pulled away by hae thoughts. Thi was considering what she had said, or so she hoped. An unfamiliar voice came in loudly on the listener, "Surfacing," and not a moment after, a woman from the top of the bow called out, "Ship approaching!" From the darkness of Ulu on the left side their ship, a great volume of water was split in two as a huge mass of steel lifted out of the water. From Melna's estimation it was nearly twice as long as Shinna's ship. The crew immediately sprung into action, taking in the sails and keeping a safe distance from the other boat. Three silhouettes appeared from a tower that protruded from the dark steel mass. Shinna shouted to them, "Hoy!" with a voice louder than three of Melna's loudest voices and a higher pitch that carried over the ocean's sounds. The three shouted back, "Hoy!" and the strange boat slowed to a halt at their closest point.

"What.. is that thing?" Melna asked hae.

"A metal behemoth. Half overwater, half under."

"What would they need with something like that?"

"It's a deterrent."

"For what? None of the navies of Palinan have an underwater ship."

Thi interrupted her, calling out to the people on the behemoth again, "Permission to board!"

"State your business!" one of the silhouettes spoke. She spoke with authority, "You should be at your posted position by now."

"We have the Heikoan!" Shinna replied.

The people on the tower were confused, so they sent someone down the tower and gestured to Shinna to hold steady.

"Don't go anywhere," said Shinna.

"Where have I got to go?" she replied.

Shinna disappeared into stowage, and Melna saw a dark figure emerge from the tower. It was cloaked in something heavy that nearly reached the floor, but Melna couldn't make out anything more about it. Bright white lights from the behemoth came on one-by-one, illuminating Shinna's ship. Shinna appeared from stowage and looked up at the lights, trying to find hae bearings, but caught sight of Melna's figure in the light, and ran to her with something in hae hand. Thi stopped very close to her and reached around her back to push something cold against her right arm.

"Take it," thi said abruptly.

"What is-"

"It's a knife. You'll need to defend yourself. Take it."

She was confused why thi was suddenly giving her a weapon, but she didn't hesitate to move her other arm to receive the small knife and its scabbard, and place it inside her robe at the top tie near her heart.

Shinna came forward and addressed the figure, "I am Shinna, captain of the third kelping ship of Rudjan. We request boarding to negotiate Melna's release."

The newest figure consulted with the speaking shadow, and she said, "Only the senator will board. There will be no negotiation."

"We were promised a placement in the new colony."

"We will confirm you when she boards."

"That's not good enough."

The two shadows spoke again and she responded, "You have one minute to comply or your boat is sunk."

The entire crew looked to Shinna who paused to wonder if they would really do such a thing. Maybe they had a way to fetch Melna after they sunk the ship. Her words were becoming truer with each passing minute and thi was scared of what that might mean. A rather anxious member of the crew approached her and said, "What are you doing? Send her up!"

"Hold on," Shinna said calmly to him, and turned to address the silhouettes once more.

"I will board with Melna. I come unarmed."

The two spoke once more and said, "No more than you. We will search your person upon arrival."

Shinna turned to Melna with a smile and whispered, "You see that? That's why they made me captain."

Four of the crew members produced a wooden ladder and cantilevered it up and out to bridge the gap between ships. Shinna secured it and checked hae pockets for any extra weapons thi might have forgotten and proceeded first followed by Melna who was significantly more careful getting down. The lights followed them as they crawled over the ocean on that rickety ladder, and Melna caught a glimpse of slight details of the behemoth. It was indeed plates of steel with strong bolts all across the hull, and few if no portholes on the sides. There was no deck to speak of, just two towers that jutted out of the hull like tall trees searching for light. As she neared the top, Shinna had already arrived on the tower and was being searched by the figure in the tower.

Thi had activated her scrappy old self. "I'm not leaving her here!" she said.

The larger silhouette spoke "You certainly won't be leaving here then," and Melna knew it was Fajro.

Shinna said, "What do you mean?"

And all at once, Fajro reached into his jacket for a strange steel weapon and Melna screamed, "Shinna, run!"

Thi ducked and scrambled for Melna and a great blast cracked the air above them. Melna grasped for Shinna's arm as thi fell off the ladder into the tall gap, and it held strong as she used hae momentum to loft hae back onto the ladder behind her. Melna smelled burnt sulfur and soot as Fajro pointed that smoking rod at her head. Melna moved to the tower and knealed to block Shinna from his line of view. Shinna screamed, "No! Don't go! They'll kill you!", as hae crew had already begun reeling the ladder back in with hae on it. Be she knew her fate. She knew that anyone who tried to save her would not be spared.

"First time seeing a gun, I take it," he said with an air of arrogance.

"Come, Melna," he gestured toward the hole he came out of. "We have much to discuss."

She looked back to make sure Shinna descended back to the safety of hae ship, then stood up and refocused her attention on the Holragi soldiers before her. Fajro smiled as he looked her up and down. The way he would look at a prize-winning saffa.

"You look like you turn a few heads in the senate," he said, eyeing her up and down. "It's a shame we never worked together."

"Truly a shame," she replied, "I could have turned your head right off."

His frown took a moment to form, and then he sighed and changed the subject, "Shall we?" as he gestured with his cane toward a plaform covering the hole in the tower they had come out of. Without protest, she stepped upon it with Fajro soon after and they descended into the belly of that mechanical beast.

The inside was a maze of tunnels with double doors at nearly every twenty paces. The walls were lined with stale yellow incandescent bulbs that brought its warmth neither to the oiled steel walls nor to the grey worn wood that made up the floor. They were cheap imitations of Ara that were nothing like the original. It disgusted her to imagine living here for several days, as undoubtedly many of those onboard had done.

The static on her listener had dulled to a whisper as Fajro led her down a meandering path that she was convinced was meant to scramble her sense of direction. But after much wandering they arrived at a large room with several people sitting at desks of knobs and buttons with wired listeners fastened to both of their ears and a protrusion on one side for what seemingly looked like a microphone. She wondered at the utility of the knobs and buttons, but knew that they were likely listening to a much more sophisticated permutation of what was around her own ear.

"Do you know why you're here, Melna?" Fajro asked her rhetorically, "And why now?"

He didn't wait for an answer.

"We are about to make history. Your jundsmaman is nearly at the obscurae. I wanted you to see this in person. To see first-hand what kind of work we're trying to do. You see, I dream of a day when we can look back on the obscura as just another problem we all managed to fix by working together. If we continue to do nothing, we submit ourselves to the will of the universe and it will eventually kill us as it is now."

He moved to stare closer to Melna's face. To make sure she was paying attention. But all she could think of was the odor of Heikoan grain glycol on his breath.

"Our vision is one in which we are no longer slaves to the chaos that lurks in the dark. We can own that chaos, transform it into something much greater than it is."

"And you'll ruthlessly murder anyone who stands in your way."

He laughed through his nose as a father might to his child, "Yes. The survival of everything on this planet depends on the success of this plan. Unfortunately, we don't have the time for debate. We only have the time to act."

"So, what's the offer?" she asked in her most diplomatic of voices. She wanted to catch him a little bit off guard.

"Always in a rush, you younger type."

"I know stalling when I hear it. Tell me how I fit into this plan of yours and I'll see what I can do."

"That's the spirit."

"Don't get me wrong, I still think you're a conniving bloodbeetle who gets off on watching others suffer. I just want to get this overwith."

"Now that's unfair."

"No, I get it. You want to be the one everyone remembers as their heroic savior. The man who thwarted the obscura and the evil Heikoans at the same time. You think that's how people think of you. But you don't know that they all secretly fear you. Wish you were gone. All you'll be remembered as is the man who destroyed a city for his own self-righteousness," she raised her voice to an increasingly flustered Fajro.

"You're being ridiculous. I wouldn't destroy a city."

"Only the slaves that built your rail, manned your army, did your bidding, will say they knew you. What do you think they'll say about you once you're gone?"

"You're wasting your breath."

"They'll be too busy ushering in their new master to remember you."

"Stop."

"You'll be dead to them. Replaced by some new woman who promises reform."

"You're not listening!"

"Long live the Queen!"

"STOP!"

"Long live the-"

He took her by the neck and pinned her against the wall of the radio room to silence her, spitting to her, "You have no idea how sorry you'll be once you are forgotten. Your people will worship the stone that I tread, the air that I breathe. You'll wish you had died here."

Despite the parade of colorful sparks blotting her eyes, and the unproductive gasps for air, She gathered his words into a theme and then an understanding of his true intentions, and she managed to put on a smirk. Fajro looked around through labored breaths as his self-awareness gradually resurfaced, and he took his hand off of her, embarrassed that his crew had seen such a belligerent outburst from him. He was beginning to realize that she was a bit more cunning than he first believed.

A radio operator announced, "Žah-Fajro. Liffa is ready," and with a shake of his head and a furious look on his face, he approached the operator and yanked the longer listener from hae ears, sloppily raising the box up to his head and pressing a button on the outer face when he wanted to talk.

"Liffa. That you?"

Melna gasped for air but listened louder.

"Right. We have her here now. I'll put her on real quick."

"Bring her here, dammit! What are you waiting for!"

One of the soldiers forcefully pushed her toward him, and he got in her face to talk at her.

"Now, listen. This isn't chitchat time. You get a few conversations, she acknowledges you're here and then you're done. Got it?"

She nodded, and he grabbed the other listener off the operator's head, giving the larger one to Melna.

Through a cracked voice she said, "Liffa? Are you there?"

A moment passed and then Liffa leapt out of the speaker, "Melna. It's really you! Where are you right now? Why does your voice sound like that?"

"It's...a long story. I'll tell you when you get back."

Another moment passed, and Melna started to think it had something to do with the vast distance that Liffa had traveled.

"Oh. Ok..."

They paused, looking for something to say in such circumstances, but Melna knew she couldn't let so much slack, and picked up again, "Say. How's the weather up there?"

Thi giggled a bit, and Melna suddenly felt a pang of longing, "A little bit of Ara, and plenty of Ulu. It's beautiful up here. I hope someday I can paint it for you."

"Yea," she said, "I'd like that."

"Hey Liffa," she asked, "What about the wind?"

There was a pause on the line as everyone in the room seemed confused. Fajro reached for the listener, but Melna intercepted his hand and Liffa responded, "The fog listens."

Melna tried to scream, "Liffa, listen, there are bombs behind you on your trajectory," but the operator pried her hands from the device and the lever had been lifted before she could finish. A soldier held her back as another picked up the listener from the floor and gave it to Fajro.

He yelled at Melna, "What did I say?!" and then immediately turned back to the microphone. "That's enough talk for now, Liffa. Let's get to work."

Melna knew what she had to do, but for now she would wait and plan as she listened to Fajro's side of the conversation.

He now had both listeners in his ears and spoke to Liffa directly, "She'll be fine. Just work with us and she will be okay. Now, can you describe what you see around you?"

<!-- "Oh. okay. I can see the obscura in closer detail now. It's a wall of tiny circles that grow outward from their centers." -->

"A-," he paused to find his words, "What kind of wall are you talking about?"

<!-- "I... can't tell. It's too far." -->

Fajro turned away fom Liffa and spoke at a softer volume, but Melna could still hear him.

"What do you mean, Liffa?"

<!-- "I'm not sure how to say this, but the obscura is closer to Ara than they thought." -->

A group of three people listening in immediately began looking through their papers to try and reckon their prior work with what they were hearing. *Had they miscalculated something?* Fajro walked over to them and unleashed his anger at them in their native language. After a few short outbursts, one of the group asked him something, and he turned back to the listener.

"Liffa, these circles. Can you tell me any more about them?"

<!-- "No. They're far, but. They don't look natural" -->

"So you think they were made by something?"

<!-- "No. I haven't seen any evidence that it's being constructed in the traditional sense." -->

"Then how..." He was becoming more and more perplexed by what Liffa was describing.

Everyone in the room had sunken faces, placing all of their hope into this one plan. Some had begun to cry silently. But Melna knew what Liffa was describing. Thimlu had explained it to her once when they were first beginning to see signs of Ara fading. The idea was simple: a machine, miniaturized; made to be far more productive than any other form of life. It was a drawing of his. Charcoal on tree bark. Some strange looking box with four arms and one hole for an eye. It could make more of itself, and the copy could then make more of itself, and it wouldn't stop until it ran out of resources. Melna, believed that such a thing was more of a toy for the mind, a handy knob for an existential crisis. But she never imagined that it could exist and grow to such an immense size.

"Are you certain?" he asked, now turned toward the three mathematicians with his back toward the rest of the room. "Getting this wrong could doom the entire planet. I want you to double check your observations."

<!-- "I am certain." -->

He paused for her response, and upon receiving it, he yelled, "DAMMIT!"

His listener took flight across the room, crash landing against a thin medical supply box behind the numbers-checkers.

"You were certain!" He targeted the three people who had rechecked their calculations, tossing their heaping piles of paper and ink onto the floor. "You swore an oath of truth in your work and in your actions."

One of them dared to speak up, "Sir, we double checked our calcul-"

"Worthless. Your math is worthless. Your calculations yielded the wrong answer. You are the best physicists in all of Palinan. And still you failed all of us. This was our one chance to survive. To destroy the obscura and bring back the light."

He had become infused with a kind of unstoppable anger.

"Stand up," he commanded. "Stand Up! Turn around!"

Melna could see him reach for his






<!-- THE BELOW IS FOR IF LIFFA REVEALS -->

<!--

Fajro was incredulous, and responded to hae impatiently, "Liffa. You're telling me that the obscura is covering all of Ara, not just our line of sight? How is that possible? Who could possibly build something that large in a matter of days?"

Melna tried to contemplate the size of such a thing. It would take thousands of generations of skilled laborers for throngia to build something of that size. Even with Holragi's level of technology, labor was always limited by population. But most important to her was a question that had vexed her from the start. Why would someone do such a thing?

<!-- "I don't know, Fajro." -->

<!-- Fajro took his head into his left hand and cursed at the wind, stale and cold through a vent in the ceiling above him as everyone in the room looked to him for guidance. But Melna was looking at the door, planning her next move. -->




<!-- NOTES -->
<!--
Fajro gives Melna a chance to save Liffa and let Heiko die (weapons meant for obscura skip it and hit Heiko), or save Heiko(and the world) by killing Liffa (destroying the obscura). If she saves the world, she must submit her people to slavery. She chooses to kill Liffa (but the silence is a red herring).

Note: Having Liffa reveal that the obscura is an infinite wall would make Fajro desparate. His idea wouldn't work anymore, and he would no longer have a bargaining chip against Melna. Therefore he would see both Liffa and Melna as useless and kill them. It would also lead to the plan being ruined and hopeless, and Fajro being tempted to use the bombs on Heiko instead, since they're useless in the sky.

If Liffa lies instead, and says it's just a big rock in the way, Fajro will be swayed to detonate the bombs in the sky instead of on Heiko. This hinges on the fact that Liffa:
- knows there are bombs on her Trajectory
- could have calculated or heard from Setre that Heiko would be where they land.
  - Setre would have to know trajectories, which her army isn't trained to do.
  - Jes, Thimlu, or Melna would have to tell hae somehow.

Tenets
- Liffa does not have knowledge of Linyu, Setre.
- Liffa does not know that bombs are coming.
- Melna decides their fate
- Melna values her people above all else, including Liffa.
  - This means she will choose to detonate in the sky
  - Fajro will recognize this as useless, and will realize they are powerless against such a powerful foe.
    - This pivot will lead to him to become sick with ambition. He will coerce Heiko to become slaves by any means.
    - Melna will be amenable to this because she has no other choice - her army isn't as strong, and they soon won't have homes. She wouldn't leave cards on the table, however. She executes a secret standoff at the pulpit, putting Fajro on the line to delivery on Liffa's mission. Liffa announces to Heiko that a better life awaits them beyond slavery, in the land of darkness. Melna sees Setre's ships barge in and yell's at them to charge into the fog. Fajro charges at her,

Melna thwarts an attempt to use Liffa as leverage against her because she knows bombing the obscura would be useless. Fajro forces her to speak to her people to tell them to become slaves to Holragi. She delivers a message on the shoreline with Fajro standing right next to her. She attempts to use the knife Shinna gave her to subdue Fajro and his soldiers. She wounds Fajro but a soldier wounds her fatally as she bleeds out.

Some are killed by ships on the surface with early guns, and Fajro's craft divides into several craft that hunt for Heikoans, but Shinna throws them a line with hae ship and Setre's fleet appear from the fog. Most make it to Setre's ships and sail to Ulukoma.

Melna's last sight is seeing her people safely outrun this giant blockade with a smile on her face.

<!-- Laen is found wrapped around Melna's body in the beginning of Linyu's part -->





<!-- Thi placed hae hands behind hae back, spread hae legs slightly, and stood in an old naval posture that Melna didn't quite understand. She looked around awkwardly as the rest of the crew saw Shinna and one-by-one followed hae in the same silent stance. Ramne, still nursing his burns, looked on in ridicule at the display until a maman standing next to him pulled him up by the arm to join. But instead of joining, he yanked his arm back and walked off to the stern of the boat.

The crew stayed in this state for a pause that felt sufficient to say their peace. Then Shinna shouted, "Oyy," to which the whole crew responded in unison, "Hah!" and resumed what they were doing. -->


<!--
"All done," thi said, and Melna turned around to face hae. Shinna's lantern lit both of their faces, hers adorned with strength, and haes filled with awe.

"You're the real deal, aren't you," thi said with quiet reverence.

"Shinna. I do not change when I put on a robe."

"No, žah-Melna," thi insisted. The honorific surprised her. "The robe is meaningless without you to fill it."

Melna smiled at hae with gratitude, "Thanks. I'll remember that."
