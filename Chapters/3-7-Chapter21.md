# Chapter 21

The blockade was unbreakable. A line of ships, five rows wide with a staggered formation hugged the Heiko peninsula and continued onto land for as the darkness would reveal. There must have been nearly a thousand ships from every province, each with a crew hungry for blood and indifferent to reason. Perhaps they wanted someone to blame for the darkness, or a morsel of Heiko's food to be divided amongst them. Or simply the feeling of importance in that desert of fear. Whatever they told themselves to stay the course, they weren't prepared to leave.

A man who was extinguishing the fire had found Melna's bag and clothes and left them neatly beside her as she looked homeward from the railing, warmed by Shinna's coat. It was a small thing, but folding her pants and coat was an unexpected gesture of goodwill. She thanked him and gently moved the folded clothes off of her bag and rummaged through it to find the listener, which she put on right away. Any word from Liffa or Holragi would certainly be welcome.

She didn't get fully dressed right away, but held her time letting her mind wander. When she was ready, she opened her bag again and removed the robes she had been carrying. This would be the last time she could fulfill her role as a senator, she figured. She would wear them proudly, protecting her homeland in one last stand of words against whichever of Holragi's sharks had come for dinner.
 
Shinna had stayed near her since the fire, knowing not to trust anyone else of hae crew with the assumption of good nature. Thi had given Melna a flat piece of sticky kelp cut to the size of her torso and suggested that she wear it. "For your wound," thi said, with as much heart as thi could muster from the depth of guilt, and Melna took it with gratitude. She disrobed from Shinna's coat to apply the makeshift bandage and change into her robes while Shinna looked away at hae crew. She moved quickly and proficiently. If these were her last moments in friendly company she didn't want to waste them getting dressed.

"Big project, this... blockade. You think any of your people will make it out?"

"I don't know," she said belaboredly, "I gave them as many messages as I could. I'm still not sure why they're after me."

"They like to keep their reasons hidden."

"Could I ask perhaps... a personal question?"

"Sure."

"Is it really fear that makes you tick? Is everyone really fighting for the chance to cower a bit longer in the dark?"

Shinna sighed as if to prepare to tell a long story. "When I was a young kaln, everything was simple. There were bad people and good people. Law and lawlessness. You may be young for a senator, but you probably know by now that things aren't quite that simple. What I've learned out here over countless years in the cold and the dark. All your good intentions mean nothing when death is staring you in the eye. Maybe it's holding you up by the coat, sword at the ready. Or maybe it's slowly gnawing away at the bones of your starving family. There is an 'us' and a 'them'. Always. And if you have to choose which will die, you will always choose 'them'."

Melna took a long pause pondering this thought. She already felt that it was true, but chose not to believe the world had come to that.

"If that is our fate," she said, "I can still buy us more time."

"More time for what?"

"Our people are clever. Somebody will have made a plan by now."

"Clever, maybe. But who will lead them? Someone like you is hard to come by."

"A good leader creates better leaders."

"Doesn't sound like anyone I know."

Melna finally got the robe setting nicely around her and called over her shoulder, "Shinna, Could you help me?" 

Thi turned to see Melna turned away and her arms holding two soft white ropes behind her back.

She said to the side, "My jundmaman usually helps me with this part, but thi's a bit busy at the moment."

Shinna walked over and took up the top rope, eyeing the quality and length. 

"Gently please," Melna said, "The wound is still fresh."

Thi tied it in a knot that only a sailor could know, both ornate in form and function. Thi was refraining from speech and hae arms moved slowly through the stiff air, hae shame alone weighing them down. Liffa appeared from Melna's memory, helping her fasten her robes in the windowlight. And Kipnu nuzzling her in the doorway. And in a daydream she wished for it all again. To relive that day and tell them that it was okay and they had nothing to worry about. 

"All done," thi said, and Melna turned around to face hae. Shinna's lantern lit both of their faces, hers adorned with strength, and haes filled with awe.

"You're the real deal, aren't you," thi said with quiet reverence.

"Shinna. I do not change when I put on a robe."

"No, Å¾ah-Melna," thi insisted. The honorific surprised her. "The robe is meaningless without you to fill it."

Melna smiled at hae with gratitude, "Thanks. I'll remember that."

"Ship approaching!" called a woman from the top of the tall bow. A large ship seemingly made entirely of steel was coming beside them from the darkness. From Melna's estimation it was nearly twice as long, but Shinna was certain that it stretched further underwater. The crew immediately sprung into action, taking in the sails in and keeping a safe distance from the other boat. A few people appeared from a tower at the top, and Shinna shouted to them, "Hoy!" with what sounded like three voices booming at once. They shouted back, "Hoy!" and the strange boat slowed to a halt at their closest point.

"This is Holragi"

"What.. is that thing?"

"It's one of their behemoths. Half overwater, half under. Thing is fully stocked for just about anything."

"What would they need with something like that"

"If I didn't know any better, I'd say they were planning ahead."

"But.. how could they have known?"

"I don't know, but it doesn't matter now"





Thi placed hae hands behind hae back, spread hae legs slightly, and stood in an old naval posture that Melna didn't quite understand. She looked around awkwardly as the rest of the crew saw Shinna and one-by-one followed hae in the same silent stance. Ramne, still nursing his burns, looked on in ridicule at the display until a maman standing next to him pulled him up by the arm to join. But instead of joining, he yanked his arm back and walked off to the stern of the boat. 

The crew stayed in this state for a pause that felt sufficient to say their peace. Then Shinna shouted, "Oyy," to which the whole crew responded in unison, "Hah!" and resumed what they were doing.


<!-- let's see. So the salute could be interesting if it happened when Holragi landed. Holragi would think it's for them, but it's really for   -->
