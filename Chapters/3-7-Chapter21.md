## Chapter 21

<!--
He leaned closer to her and pulled some things out of a pocket in his coat.

"Linyu left this for you."

He lifted his hand from his coat and produced a satchel, which Melna hesitantly took and opened. On the top were two thick ornamental vials in a disc shape with a reddish liquid inside them.

"What is in these vials?"

"A cure for the undying."

She looked at him for a moment, trying to interpret his meaning, but paused to continue digging into the satchel. At the bottom was a copper coil embedded in a wooden puck: the same that Linyu was fiddling with. The coil had been hastily tied to a round glass plate, with one long length of wire pointed outward and a flap of dry kelp covering the center. Gently closing the satchel, she quickly hid the gift away in her field pack, still confused.

"Why did Linyu leave these for me?" she asked, bewildered, "And who are you?"

"The wind speaks," he said mysteriously. "You must listen."

_Who was he?_ She took out the coil device he gave her and ran her fingers along the copper windings, imagining what such a strange thing might be for. She knew that train motors often had coils of wire, but this didn't appear to be a motor of any kind. It was too delicate and precise to be pushing anything. _The wind speaks? Who are you?_

-->

The contours of Heiko center crept up on the horizon, stippled with the yellow-orange beacons of a hundred thousand lanterns burning through the darkness. She hadn't seen such a sight since her first twelfth harvest festival, in the time before the electric rails had come to Heiko. It was a welcome sight, regardless of the circumstances by which Melna was arriving. She knew that it meant they were awake.

Melna felt the muffled thud of a bag landing next to her, and looked up to find Panna standing above her.

"Your bag, žah-fidelant," thi said mockingly. Melna opened the singed flap of her bag and rummaged through it, finding her fidelant robes and garb still intact and folded neatly. Underneath them was Fanla's listener, a warm glass bottle of water, and a bundle of flat kelp ribbon.

Thi began to walk away, but Melna reached for hae tunic.

"Panna... sit with me."

Thi hesitated, looked around for conspicuous lookers-on, then chose a spot some distance away from Melna to avoid giving the wrong impression. Thi averted hae eyes as Melna disrobed from Shinna's coat. Through sharp pains and clenched teeth, she poured the water on her burns and began to wrap the kelp ribbon around her torso.

"Can't you go any faster, woman?" asked Panna.

"It would be a lot quicker with some help."

Panna looked at Melna with a half-lustful half-disgusted gaze that wasn't lost on Melna.

"I'm not your nurse," thi said, and then thi shuffled over and took the bandages into hae own hands as Melna sat up straight with her hands above her head. Panna began quickly and roughly, making sure the kelp was tight and well-mended to each other piece. But Melna's face turned red and dewy; even the hardest of sailors knew when to stop.

"Thank you, Panna," said Melna after thi had finished tying the end. Her face was still flush with pain. Panna didn't respond, but went right back to hae spot a distance away.

When she was ready, Melna opened her bag again and removed the robes she had been carrying. This would be the last time she could fulfill her role as a fidelant, she figured. She would wear them proudly, in a symbolic stance against whichever of Holrag's sharks were coming for dinner.

Her hands moved gracefully and proficiently despite her burns, recalling the movements from some distant but tidy corner of her memory.

"Panna", she called over her shoulder, "Could you help me with these waistropes?"

"Fidelants. Can't even dress themselves."

"These are my last moments in friendly company. I don't want to waste them getting dressed."

Thi made the strange ticking sound with the tip of hae tongue again and walked over slowly, making sure that Melna knew thi was annoyed. Thi took the ropes lazily from her hands, and eyed the quality of the rope and length to work with.

"Gently please," Melna said, "The wound is still fresh."

"Big project, this... blockade," thi asked while starting a square knot. "You think any of your people will make it out?"

"I don't know," she said, her voice belabored. "Holragi has a far stronger military presence. I don't know what we can do."

"Eh, those Holragi dogs don't care about their jobs. Everyone is enslaved to someone else out there."

"It's not the soldiers I fear. It's their children, their siblings, their friends and lovers. A soldier fights harder if there's something to lose." she said.

"I guess it's an even battle then."

Thi tried to tidy up the knot on her waist, but quickly found that nothing could right its skew.

"It's fine," said Melna, but Panna loosened the knot and tied it again to get it right.

"Shinna sees I tied a knot like this, thi'd throw a tantrum."

"What was that?" asked Shinna as thi approached the two.

"I said you'd throw a tantrum," Panna said louder. "You know, like a baby?"

"One more time, Panna, I swear."

"That's what you said last time. And the time before that–"

"And I fucking meant it now go clean up the mess from the fire."

"Fine," said Panna taking a few steps away, "Got a few knobs to polish down there anyway."

"Shbpaaah," Shinna exclaimed under hae breath, and took a long deep breath to forget about hae.

"You look like you're about to save the world," thi said, looking at Melna up and down.

"I am," she said without a beat.

"In any other time, what you're doing would be considered legendary. I fear that no one will be around to tell your side of the story."

"If none of my people survive, then such a title would be undeserving, don't you think?"

Shinna held haeself from saying the multitudes of apologies and praises that thi wanted to say. Thi knew none of it would seem genuine from hae in such a moment.

"We're almost to the blockade. Are you ready?"

"Could I perhaps... ask a personal question first?"

"No," thi responded, but Melna continued anyway.

"Is it fear that makes you tick? Is the whole world really fighting for a chance to live in the desert?"

Shinna sighed as if to prepare to tell a long story. "When I was a young kaln, everything seemed simple. There were good people and bad people. Law and lawlessness. 'Us' and 'them'. We both may be young for who we are, but we both know by now that all simple things are lies that someone has sold to you. Every good intention, every tenet of philosophy, every teaching from wise people in a time of prosperity. They all mean nothing when death is staring you in the eye. It could be holding you up by neck with a sword to your chest. Or slowly gnawing away at the bones of your starving children. Or it could be some weird dots in the sky shutting off Ara. If you were given a choice to let a million strangers die or watch everyone you love freeze to death, you will always. Always. Save your own."

Melna sat with what thi said, and vehemently disagreed in her mind. But she figured it was best if she kept her thoughts to herself.

"You think anyone in Heiko knows?" thi asked.

"We are a clever people," she said.

"Clever, maybe. But can anyone lead them right now? Someone like you is hard to come by."

"Heiko is full of astute planners, strong fighters, and persuasive leaders. But a truly great leader trains even better leaders for their inveitable absence."

"Doesn't sound like any leader I know."

Melna's memory conjured a memory of Liffa helping her fasten her robes in the windowlight. And Kipnu nuzzling her in the doorway. And in a daydream she wished for it all again. To relive that day and tell them that it was okay. That they had nothing to worry about.

"You know," she started to formulate why she disagreed with Shinna, "I loved once. Not long ago. I lost them trying to bring peace to the senate. In the end it was worthless. Holrag's insatiable hunger brought us here: blockaded by a superior force while we try to flee for our lives from certain destruction. I want you to remember whatever happens here today. If you truly believe that we are beyond saving, that all the worlds' nations and tribes must fend for themselves, then surely you will be next."

Shinna's attention had been pulled away by hae thoughts, and Melna took the moment to toss her satchel onto her shoulders again.

"Maybe you're right Melna," said Shinna. "Maybe they're leading us on. But the only other option is certain death."

"No. Not death," she said, grasping at hae hand. "A fight is not death."

"All the world against the Holragi? We'd be doing the obscura a favor."

A man from the top of the bow called out, "Ship approaching!" From the darkness of Ulu, a great volume of water was split clear in half as a huge mass of black steel breached the water. From Melna's estimation it was nearly twice as long as Shinna's ship, and some unfathomable length underneath. The crew immediately sprung into action, taking in the sails and stabilizing the rudder to avoid a collision.

Three silhouettes appeared from the towering dark and stood looking down at them. "Hoy!" Shinna shouted to them with a voice louder than any Melna had heard at the senate. But the phantoms didn't respond, they kept looking down and talking amongst each other.

"What.. is that thing?" Melna asked.

"A submersible. They float just below the surface to stay invisible. I've seen a few but never one this big."

"What would they need with something like that?"

"It's a deterrent."

"There's no ship in Palinan nearly that size. It's a weapon of conquering, not of defense–"

"Permission to board!" Thi interrupted her, calling out to the people on the submersible again. "We have the Heikoi!"

The people on the tower spoke amongst each other, and Melna saw their relationships. The left and right were soldiers by the stance and their armored look. In the center was a man with a lantern, someone of status, giving orders and guiding the operation. He clambered down a ladder with the lantern in his teeth and then gestured to Shinna to hold steady.

Shinna glanced at Melna. "Don't go anywhere," thi said.

"Really?" she asked rhetorically.

Shinna disappeared into stowage, and Melna saw a new dark figure emerge from the tower. It was cloaked in something heavy that nearly reached the floor, but Melna couldn't make out anything more about it. Suddenly, bright white lights from the giant submersible began to flip on one-by-one, illuminating everyone on the deck in a cold blue-white light.

"How are they doing that?" Melna asked aloud. She looked up at the rails above her to make sure they hadn't strayed from path, but she knew they would be there. There was nothing but dread in her heart as she stared into the blinding light.

Shinna appeared from stowage with a hand at hae forehead, trying to find hae bearings. Thi caught sight of Melna's figure in the light and ran back to her with something hidden in hae hand.

"Take it," thi said abruptly, reaching around her back to push something cold against her side.

"What is-"

"You'll need to defend yourself. Take it."

She hesitated, confused.

"Take it!" thi said under hae breath, and Melna move her left arm to receive the small knife from behind her. It was covered in a waxed cloth, perfect to blend with the cloth she was wrapped in. She discreetly slipped it inside the bottom of her robe at an angle where she could reach it easily, and drew a circle of gratitude on Shinna's back with her finger.

Shinna came forward and addressed the negotiator, "I am the captain. We request boarding to negotiate the fidelant's release."

But the cloaked figure on the tower seemed to hear hae clearly, and spoke silently into an instrument without pause, and the negotiator responded soon after.

"Only the fidelant will board. There will be no negotiation," he said.

"We were promised a position in the Red Circle."

"We will confirm you when she boards."

"That's not good enough," Shinna insisted.

The cloaked figure spoke again and the soldier responded accordingly. "You have one minute to accept or your ship will be destroyed."

The entire crew looked to Shinna who paused to wonder if they would really do such a thing. Melna's convictions were becoming truer with each passing minute and thi was scared of what that might mean.

Ramne approached them, limping through the pain, a streak of blue surrounding his wounds.

"What are you waiting for?" he said, anxiously. "Send her up!"

"Hold on," Shinna said sternly, and turned to address the silhouettes once more.

"I will board with Melna. I come unarmed."

"You and the fidelant. No more. We will search your person upon arrival."

Shinna turned to Melna with a smile and whispered, "See that? The great negotiator of Yansha just saved your ass." But secretly, thi was terrified that hae bluff was called.

The negotiator yelled "Make way!" and the crew backed up as the soldiers on the tower threw giant metal hooks with cables attached across the water and onto their deck, securing them on the railing. Mechanical pulleys dropped down each of them and came to rest at the edge of the Kutsa.

"Proceed!" he said, then climbed back up the the ladder he'd come down on.

The bright lights from the submersible followed them as the mechanical pulleys pulled them up and over the water on steel cables. Melna caught a glimpse of the submersible at the edges of hae shaddow. It was indeed made of plates of steel with strong rivets all across the hull, and not a window in sight. There was no deck to speak of, just the one tower that jutted out of the hull like a tall tree searching for light. As she neared the top, Shinna had already arrived on the tower and was being searched by the soldiers.

"I'm not leaving her here!" thi said.

"You certainly won't be leaving here then," said the cloaked figure, and Melna knew his voice like a cruel nightmare come to haunt her again.

"Get away from hae, Fajro!" she said. Shinna ducked behind the steel railing to help Melna up onto the tower when all at once, Fajro reached into his jacket for a strange steel weapon and pointed it at Shinna.

"Go!" Melna said to Shinna, but a great blast cracked the air above them and set their ears ringing. Shinna had jumped out of reflex, loosening hae grip just enough for hae to begin falling. Melna grasped for Shinna's arm as quickly as she could, and it held strong. With hae momentum, she lofted hae high enough to reach the pulley thi had arrived on.

The odor of burnt sulfur and soot filled the air as Fajro pointed the weapon at her head. Melna moved herself onto the tower and stood in front of Shinna to block his line of view.

"No! Don't go! They'll kill you!", Shinna screamed. Be she knew her fate. She knew that anyone who tried to save her would not be spared. She pushed gently on the pulley behind her and sent Shinna back down the cable.

"No!" Shinna screamed, "No!" but hae voice disappeared into the cold air.

"First time seeing a gun, I take it," said Fajro with an air of arrogance.

"Come, Melna," he gestured toward the hole he'd come out of. "We have much to discuss."

She looked back at the ship that brought her here, at Shinna, and the conflict thi held within haeself, who was scrambling to climb back up the rope as Fajro's soldiers cut the lines and Panna held hae back for hae own safety. And the crew who saw her only as a token in exchange for their lives. They would have been fools not to take it from anyone else.

Fajro smiled as he looked her up and down the way he might inspect a prize-winning saffa. There is no displeasure quite like the stare of an impudent stranger. But there are some who cast their delusions onto the skin of others and fill them with the rot that lives inside their hearts. Fajro was one of them.

"You look like you turn a few heads in the senate," he said, eyeing her up and down. "It's a shame we never worked together."

"Truly a shame," she replied, "I could have turned yours right off."

His frown took a moment to form, and then he sighed and changed the subject, "Shall we?" as he gestured with his cane toward a large circular metal door in the floor. With a clank and a squeak, the door swung downward, and a platform rose to fill the gap. Without protest, she stepped upon it with Fajro and his soldiers close behind, and they descended into the belly of that mechanical beast.

The inside was a maze of tunnels with opened doors as thick as her hand every twenty paces, and walls lined with glass bulbs that glowed that same blindingly bright bluish-white color. They sucked the warmth out of both the greased steel walls and the knurled red iron that made up the floor. It disgusted her to imagine living here for several days, as undoubtedly many of those onboard had done.

Fajro led her down a meandering path that she was convinced was meant to scramble her sense of direction, but after much wandering they arrived at a large room where rows of desks had been constructed with flat glass bulbs protruding from them. Sitting at each one was a lab-coated Holragi, busy drawing and writing things on paper while they stared at the red light bulbs. The back of the room was lined with a row of knobs and buttons set into metal boxes, and black cable leading to a listener on every ear that sat there. There was one microphone at the center with a lever on it like the ones at the conduits. Melna figured was for speaking over the air. She slowly reached into her satchel for the listener, but stopped. They didn't yet know that she could hear what they could hear.

"Do you know why you're here, Melna?" Fajro asked her rhetorically

"We are about to make history," he said with open arms to sing the praises for this place. "Liffa is about to meet the obscura and open our eyes to who they are. I wanted you to see this in person; to see first-hand what kind of work we're trying to do."

He turned to her with a face full of conviction.

"I dream of a day when we can look back on this time as nothing but a short blip in history. A cold spell in a time of prosperity. But for this to happen, we need strong leaders. People like you and me. We cannot stand idly by and watch the obscura destroy us. We must take action."

He took her hand and spoke with the odor of Heikoi grain on his breath. She felt her skin crawl, her pores closing.

"You and me, we're not so different, you know. We're both visionaries fighting to save this world as it teeters over a dark cliff."

"We are nothing alike," she said. "Your actions help no one but you."

He laughed through his nose as a father might to his child, "The survival of everything on this planet depends on the success of this plan. Unfortunately, this is not a problem that can afford debate. Dissenters must be silenced for the greater good. You understand."

She was done with his words. "So, what's the offer?" she asked in her most diplomatic of voices. She wanted to catch him a little bit off guard.

"Always in a rush, you younger ones."

"I can tell when a man is stalling. Tell me how I fit into this plan of yours."

He snickered amusedly. "I applaud your enthusiasm," he said.

"Oh don't get me wrong. I still think these deranged ideas of yours are nothing more than the musings of a man so wet with power that he's given up on the social pact he swore to protect. I just want to get this overwith."

"Everything I do is _for_ the pact. It is _for_ the provinces. _You_ have been standing in the way–"

"–No, I get it now. You want to be the one everyone remembers as their heroic savior. The man who thwarted the obscura and the evil Heikoi at the same time. You want to think you're in the right, that people truly think well of you. But through all this power, your weapons, your labor camps; you still can't see past the illusion that the fear you see around you is protection."

"They fear the obscura. I am their salvation."

"They are afraid of you and you are their last resort."

"My legacy is written in steel, not blood."

"Steel," she laughed. "And who forged it into your rails, twisted it into your cables, cast it into your weapons? What kinds of stories do you think your slaves tell about you? What do they think when they polish your guns?"

"You're wasting your breath."

"Your days will dwindle as you clutch tighter, and by the time you've realized how powerless you've become, a new master will have risen."

"You will stop at once–"

"You'll be dead to them. Replaced by a child of the revolution, someone who promises that your atrocities will not go unpunished."

"You're not listen–"

"You'll beg and grovel for their attention, rotting in an underground pris–"

He took her by the neck and pinned her against the wall of the radio room to silence her, spitting to her, "You have no idea who you're dealing with. Your people will worship the stone that I tread, the air that I breathe. You'll wish you had died here while everything you love turns to ashes in the blink of an eye!"

Through the unproductive gasps for air, she managed to put on a smirk. Fajro looked around through labored breaths as his self-awareness gradually resurfaced, and he took his hand off of her, embarrassed that his crew had seen such a belligerent outburst.

A radio operator called to him, "Žah-Fajro," and with a furious look on his face, he approached the operator, yanking the long corded listener from hae ears. Sloppily, he raised the microphone device to his face and pressed a button that had been directly fastened to it.

"Liffa," he said, pretending to be settled. "That you?"

Melna breathed heavily to replace her lost air, but steadied her breathing so she could listen closely as they continued.

"Right," he said, "She's here now. I'll put her on."

"Bring her here, dammit!" he barked at the soldiers surrounding Melna. "What are you waiting for!"

One of them pulled her by the arm, dragging her to Fajro. He came uncomfortably close to where she stood.

"This isn't catch-up time. You get a few conversations, thi acknowledges you're here and then you're done."

She nodded coldly. Fajro waved his hand in the air and an operator near to Melna gave the strange listener apparatus to her, while another much further away rested hae fingers steadily upon a brass switch.

Melna gathered every portion of her mental fortitude to protect herself against Fajro's games. With her left hand, she positioned the listeners comfortable on her ears. Across that vast unfathomable expanse, Melna heard the burdened breaths of the maman she swore her life to. The lever sank underneath her thumb and her breath began to fog up the air and mix with Liffa's. She thought of something to say, but every word in her head felt wrong, distant, disingenuous. But breath spoke multitudes more.

"Say something," Fajro interrupted them. But they didn't dare say a word.

There was a long, confused pause as the tension in the room mounted. Fajro reached for the listener, but Melna turned out of his way and held her hand out to fend against him.

She said that "The wind speaks."

And I told her that "Ulukoma listens."

The operator pried the listener off her head, her fingers off the microphone lever while Melna fought hae off. She got a finger onto the microphone as it lay on the floor. "Liffa!" she cried, but a soldier had already gotten a hand on her and was pulling her back.

Fajro stood by with a disappointed look on his face, gestured toward another soldier to bind Melna's hands while the operator gathered the microphone and listener from the floor and held them up to Fajro, hae head down in submission.

"You would do well to move faster next time," he told hae. Carefully, Fajro took the listener and microphone from hae hands, not once looking at hae. Hae hands had a barely perceptible tremble to them as thi grasped onto hae seat and sank into it.

"That's enough talk for now, Liffa. Let's get to work... What's that?... Oh she'll be fine. Let's just focus for now, okay?"

<!-- left off -->

<!--
 speak. "Liffa? Are you there?"

A moment passed and then my voice leapt into the room, "Melna. It's really you! Where are you? Why does your voice sound like that?"

"It's...a long story," she replied, "I'll tell you when you get back."

"Oh. Ok...," I replied, parsing her defeated tone. Another moment passed before Melna heard me, and she started to realize that it had something to do with the vast distance that my ship had traveled.

We paused, looking for something to say, but Melna knew she couldn't let the conversation go slack. She picked up again, "How's the weather where you are?"

I giggled at her joke, then felt a pang of longing for a simpler time.

"Cool and partly obscura-y," I said, covering my pain. "It's rather beautiful up here. I'll paint it for you someday."

"Yea," she said, "I'd like that."

I couldn't speak. Reality had sunk into me and sprouted.

"Liffa," she asked, "What about the wind?"
 -->

Fajro gestured to a man at the far side of the room, who approached her with a long, thick swatch of razor jute and placed it around her mouth while Fajro held her arms. She fought against him, but every movement against the mask stung her cheeks. The jute sunk into her mouth as he tightened the mask behind her head. Her cheeks flushed with perspiration but she held her tongue from causing further pain.

He said to her calmly, "You disrespect me, Melna. I didn't want to resort to this, but this is the only thing that will keep your schemes in check."

She stared at him intently, trying to figure out his angle. _He needs me,_ she thought. _He wouldn't put all this together and muffle me just to toy with me._

Fajro regained his stance, keeping Melna in the corner of his eye, and took up the microphone and listener again.

"Sorry about that, Liffa," he said to me. I was too confused to answer. "Now, if I'm not mistaken, you're about to pass to the other side of the obscura. Can you describe what you see around you?"

"Yes sir... I-I can see the obscura in closer detail now. It... looks a bunch of circles floating in space. They're all growing outward from their centers."

"Circles?" he paused to find his words, "How big are they?"

"Small. No larger than my own ship. But there are so many. More than I can count."

"Liffa... how far do they stretch?"

I paused, knowing the answer, but attempting to comprehend what I was seeing. "I... can't tell."

Fajro turned away fom Melna and spoke to me at a softer volume so Melna couldn't hear.

"Come on, Liffa. Tell me something more. Use your eyes."

"I can't see very far," I told the truth.

"What's the matter with your vision?"

"It's blurry, sir."

He was doubtful, but continued with me.

"Just tell me what you can see then."

"Well, I'm just a few thousand paces out now... I think I can see through a few of the cracks in the shapes... wait. No!"

"What's wrong?" He sounded legitimately concerned.

I peered through a crack and saw what I would never have expected. There were reflections from the other side of Ara. The wall covered the entirety of our star.

"This wall of shapes. It doesn't end. They're forming a sphere around Ara, and I'm headed straight into it."

"What?!" he said loudly. Melna heard the worry in this word along with the rest of the people listening in. He turned around to see everyone staring, and then went quiet again.

I continued, worried, "What. What do I do?"

"Liffa, could you hold, for one moment."

He took his finger off of the microphone lever and yelled across the room, "Kavva, how close is thi to the obscura"

"About 720 paces, sir," thi said.

He paused to take that in, disregarding my agitated silence. Under my breath, I was cursing as if seeing something genuinely horrifying. Melna had never known me to be in such a state, and it shocked her to hear.

He pressed on the lever of the listener again and said, "Yea Liffa, you're pretty close. Thing must be pretty big from where you are, but we have just about all we need, so I'm gonna let you go."

"Wait! What do I do?"

"I'll leave you to my engineer who will take you up to obscura, ok?"

"No. Wait, don't–"

But before I could finish, Fajro had switched off the speaker and the room went dead. From the corner of her eye, Melna glanced at the switch and at the people who sat near it, and saw that no one had any intention of turning it back on. She knew then that they were prepared to sacrifice me and her heart sank. That Fajro would kill to keep secret whatever horrors lie behind the veil of the obscura sickened her and she wanted to bring an end to his twisted game. But between the number of people in the room, and the vigilance of the crew, she surmised that she didn't stand a chance flipping it back off.

He put down the listeners and paused for a moment to think, switching his tone suddenly when he was ready to talk.

"Now that I have your attention, Melna. It's time to make a deal. I offer you the chance to save Liffa and join me in welcoming our hero back home from a glorious victory against the obscura."

"What's in it for you?" She asked coyly.

"All I ask is your allegiance. An address to the people of Heiko that the senate has chosen me as its leader."

"How stupid do you think I am?"

"You may doubt me when I say this, but that's all I've wanted from the beginning. The only hope for the future of our people is to unify."

"We are unified under the senate. We keep peace."

"The senate. Heh," he chuckled under his breath and began pacing back and forth. "The senate has no real power. It is a Milta diguised as a Tilmara. It convinces people to stay in line, to stay comfortable, to stay doomed. Peace is a veil, Melna. It shrouds our eyes to our true potential as a species. War, that's where heroes are made. Where civilization itself is tested."

"War is where civilization goes to die. Innumerable lives are lost and nothing is gained for anyone. The senate maintains peace because the alternative is senseless."

"The senate maintains peace for its fidelants to keep their jobs. None of them want any real change. They want to appeal to stronger members so the money can continue flowing in. They would never threaten anything. A war would lift the veil; would show the rest of the world how little their fidelants do for them."

"And you have the real power in Palinan, do you?"

"Well, frankly," he stopped and lifted his arms as if holding up the universe as evidence. "Yes."

She was unamused.

Fajro took one step toward her, letting the light illuminate the creases of his face and the grin that folded them. She looked up at his tall figure, contemplating the choice between leading her people into Fajro's twisted desires, and letting them die fighting him. But she knew her answer even before she had left Shinna's ship.

"I'll do it."

<!-- NOTES -->
<!--
Fajro gives Melna a chance to save Liffa and let Heiko die (weapons meant for obscura skip it and hit Heiko), or save Heiko(and the world) by killing Liffa (destroying the obscura). If she saves the world, she must submit her people to slavery. She chooses to kill Liffa (but the silence is a red herring).

Note: Having Liffa reveal that the obscura is an infinite wall would make Fajro desparate. His idea wouldn't work anymore, and he would no longer have a bargaining chip against Melna. Therefore he would see both Liffa and Melna as useless and kill them. It would also lead to the plan being ruined and hopeless, and Fajro being tempted to use the bombs on Heiko instead, since they're useless in the sky.

If Liffa lies instead, and says it's just a big rock in the way, Fajro will be swayed to detonate the bombs in the sky instead of on Heiko. This hinges on the fact that Liffa:
- knows there are bombs on her Trajectory
- could have calculated or heard from Setre that Heiko would be where they land.
  - Setre would have to know trajectories, which her army isn't trained to do.
  - Thimlu, Jesse, or Melna would have to tell hae somehow.

Tenets
- Liffa does not have knowledge of Linyu, Setre.
- Liffa does not know that bombs are coming.
- Melna decides their fate
- Melna values her people above all else, including Liffa.
  - This means she will choose to detonate in the sky
  - Fajro will recognize this as useless, and will realize they are powerless against such a powerful foe.
    - This pivot will lead to him to become sick with ambition. He will coerce Heiko to become slaves by any means.
    - Melna will be amenable to this because she has no other choice - her army isn't as strong, and they soon won't have homes. She wouldn't leave cards on the table, however. She executes a secret standoff at the pulpit, putting Fajro on the line to delivery on Liffa's mission. Liffa announces to Heiko that a better life awaits them beyond slavery, in the land of darkness. Melna sees Setre's ships barge in and yell's at them to charge into the fog. Fajro charges at her,

Melna thwarts an attempt to use Liffa as leverage against her because she knows bombing the obscura would be useless. Fajro forces her to speak to her people to tell them to become slaves to Holrag. She delivers a message on the shoreline with Fajro standing right next to her. She attempts to use the knife Shinna gave her to subdue Fajro and his soldiers. She wounds Fajro but a soldier wounds her fatally as she bleeds out.

Some are killed by ships on the surface with early guns, and Fajro's craft divides into several craft that hunt for Heikoi, but Shinna throws them a line with hae ship and Setre's fleet appear from the fog. Most make it to Setre's ships and sail to Ulukoma.

Melna's last sight is seeing her people safely outrun this giant blockade with a smile on her face.

<!-- Laen is found wrapped around Melna's body in the beginning of Linyu's part -->

<!-- Thi placed hae hands behind hae back, spread hae legs slightly, and stood in an old naval posture that Melna didn't quite understand. She looked around awkwardly as the rest of the crew saw Shinna and one-by-one followed hae in the same silent stance. Ramne, still nursing his burns, looked on in ridicule at the display until a maman standing next to him pulled him up by the arm to join. But instead of joining, he yanked his arm back and walked off to the stern of the boat.

The crew stayed in this state for a pause that felt sufficient to say their peace. Then Shinna shouted, "Oyy," to which the whole crew responded in unison, "Hah!" and resumed what they were doing. -->

<!--
"All done," thi said, and Melna turned around to face hae. Shinna's lantern lit both of their faces, hers adorned with strength, and haes filled with awe.

"You're the real deal, aren't you," thi said with quiet reverence.

"Shinna. I do not change when I put on a robe."

"No, žah-Melna," thi insisted. The honorific surprised her. "The robe is meaningless without you to fill it."

Melna smiled at hae with gratitude, "Thanks. I'll remember that."
