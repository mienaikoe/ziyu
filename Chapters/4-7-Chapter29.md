The boat laid bare in the low tide of morning, hanging onto a patch of sand not far from the shoddy fishing dock that Pomri and I had left from.

"You were right, Annu," I yelled to her. "He's here."

A shudder must have overcome hae. Thi heard me, but hae focus remained on the land ahead.

We came to the dock and Shinna and I went through the motions with the ropes while the others caught their breath. I watched in awe again as Shinna formed a complex knot with a few quick flicks of the rope.

"What do you really feel about him?" I asked Shinna, "about Ramne?"

"'s lucrative to know a man like that, you know?" thi said with a tone of reminiscence. "He gets you hooked on the money, then one day you realize you don't know how to live without it."

I stayed quiet, hoping thi had something more to say.

"Oh no, don't get the wrong impression," thi said after a pause. "He has many hooks like that. He's gotten everyone I've ever known addicted in some way or another. Ramne is a weed; he's better off plucked."

"You and I both know that he will take you out the first chance he gets."

"Then let's make sure he can't."

Thi made a gesture with hae hands of plunging a syringe into hae left heart. I didn't smile.

Annu seemed to be a little out of sorts, still holding close to Boon whose tail was calmer than the ocean. I waded to hae boat, to help hae down.

"Annu, are you coming?"

"It's coming back to me now."

"What?" I asked, confused.

"When I left. It was a big ship, parked further out. He dragged me through the water as I lay paralyzed. But I remember every moment: the feeling of water curling over my face, the little bits of sand that got into my nose. I remember what it felt like to die by his hand for the first time."

Thi began to tremble as hae eyes stared further and further into hae mind, clutching fast to Boon until she yelped, "Ai!"
