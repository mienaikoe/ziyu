The boat laid bare, hanging onto a patch of sand not far from the shoddy fishing dock that Pomri and I had left from.

"You were right, Annu," I yelled to her across the water. "He's here."

A shudder must have overcome hae. Thi heard me, but there was nothing thi had to say.

We came to the dock and let Boon and Laen catch their breath as Shinna and I went through the motions with the ropes. I watched in awe again as Shinna formed a complex knot with a few quick flicks of the rope. Annu seemed to be a little out of sorts.

"What do you really feel about him," I asked Shinna, "about Ramne."

"He made us a bunch of money. But he's better off dead."
