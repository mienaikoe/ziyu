"Oi, Linyu!" Shinna called to me, "Wake up."

I awoke from Laen's back, groggy but functional, and laid my eyes upon my homeland, Ulukoma. Only the trees were visible in the dim twilight, blotting out the few red stars that held their flames to the waning horizon. I looked around to orient myself, and found the shoddy fishing dock that Pomri and I had left from. A mere few paces away was the boat we had left with, hanging onto a patch of sand in the low tide of morning.

"You were right, Annu," I yelled to her. "He's here."

A shudder must have overcome hae. Thi heard me, but hae focus remained on the land ahead.

We came to the dock and Shinna and I went through the motions with the ropes while the others caught their breath. I watched in awe again as Shinna formed a complex knot with a few quick flicks of the rope.

"What do you really feel about him?" I asked Shinna, "about Ramne?"

"'s lucrative to know a man like that, you know?" thi said with a tone of reminiscence. "He gets you hooked on the money, then one day you realize you don't know how to live without it."

I stayed quiet, hoping thi had something more to say.

"Oh no, don't get the wrong impression," thi said after a pause. "He has many hooks like that. He's gotten everyone I've ever known addicted in some way or another. Ramne is a weed; he's better off plucked."

"You and I both know that he will take you out the first chance he gets."

"Then let's make sure he can't."

Thi made a gesture with hae hands of plunging a syringe into hae left heart. I didn't smile.

Annu seemed to be a little out of sorts, still holding close to Boon whose tail was calmer than the ocean. I waded to hae boat, to help hae down.

"Annu, are you coming?"

"It's coming back to me now," thi said, looking deeply into the water.

"What is?" I asked, confused.

"When I left... It was a big ship, anchored further out. He bound me with rope and dragged me through the water while I struggled for aiir. I can feel every moment. Even the little bits of sand and bubble across my face. The water got deeper, and... there was nothing to push against. I remember the tunnel vision. That stale air was so painful to hold inside, but the water was even worse."

Thi began to tremble as hae eyes stared further and further into hae mind, clutching fast to Boon's fur until she yelped, "Ai!" and Annu snapped out of it.

"I'm sorry Boon," thi said gently.

I began to cry, as my own memories popped in and out of my consciousness and colored my empathy for hae.

Thi said, "I can never erase these memories of dying. They haunt me everywhere I go."

"Then don't," I implored. "Those memories will save you from going back to him."

"Like antikan."

My face flushed at the memory of my mother. _This is what thi would have done_.

"Yea. A bit like antikan," I said.

Behind us, Shinna adressed hae crew.

"Smell that?" thi sniffed the air catching particles of smoke from the fire that ravaged the great pavilion. "The feast awaits us!"

The crew howled their agreement in "Aii"s and "Ouu"s. Even Laen got into it with a long "Woooooo". All of these people deserved what they came for, but I worried about how Setre and the guardians might react to a sudden need to feed twenty sailors from Ramne's old smuggling outfit.

Shinna held hae hand to me, making me suddenly aware of my importance.

"Linyu," thi said, "lead the way."

I recalled the path through the trees with my feet, each step a little closer to the memory of home I knew from before Lissa. The others didn't see the forest the way I did: a continuum of cause and effect, of quiet patterns in the noise of reality. Even the path, tread out by the footsteps of guardians, had changed to adapt to the forest. A fallen branch since removed by the mystery of decay, a colony of diving bugs making a new home in the ground; every deviation was proof that life had endured in spite of our insistence of boundaries and borders, roads and railways. It would continue to do so.

Upon my arm was Annu, nearly blind from a relapse of the strange Kanosin infection thi seemed to have. Shinna's party ignored hae as if to assume thi was an addict, requiring nothing further than to know that thi had been a servant of the kanosin peddler extraordinaire. Their ignorance frustrated me; not out of pity but of disdain for their will to maintain it. I wanted to show them that Annu was good. I wanted to show them the giant wound that Annu had suffered to save me, that thi knew of a way to save us. I wanted to show them how wrong they were about hae. But I couldn't trust them yet.

"Ai, Linyu. How long?" asked Shinna. "The scent of smoked fish is making my belly grumble."

_Not fish, you idiot._

"Not long now," I said, "I can see the fire just ahead."

Yes, I could see the fire, but the glow was faint – too faint to keep the injured warm, and barely large enough to cook for more than a few people – but I didn't tell the others. Their disappointment would turn them against me soon if I didn't think of something fast.

"Annu," I said, "We need to get out of here."

"Not so fast."

Setre's voice pierced me, made me wince in frustration. I had forgotten how much she cared for preparation.

<!--
  - If Linyu, Annu and the Saffas go to the hideout, it would be like part2 all over again
    - part 3 also kind of mirrors Liffa's journey in Part 1
    - Ramne might be responsible for the fire being lowered. Linyu would predict it.
      - He's not on Kanosin but has a stash in his hand to see and in case he needs it.
  - They could be captured by Ramne
    - Ramne would offer Shinna+ a deal for their allegiance
      - Eternal life (Linyu would be like OH SHIT NO I was gonna do that)
        - "This kaln was going to cut you out of the deal. Feed you well, then shut you out"
  - They could be captured by Setre + Guardians
    - Setre wouldn't believe anything Linyu says, and would likely threaten Annu
    - The crew wouldn't be fed, they'd turn on Linyu
      - Everyone turning on Linyu is an excellent point of drama, but not easy to write out of.
      - Fanla would believe because she saw it
