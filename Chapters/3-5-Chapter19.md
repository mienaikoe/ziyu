## Chapter 19

"Woop?" cried Laen from the left-most gate.

"Laen-Laen!" Melna responded with joy. She hurried over to him and asked, "Are you ok? Do you know where Bavle is?"

He appeared in a good state but shook his head in denial and worry for Bavle. Melna comforted him with a gentle scratch on his forehead.

"It's ok. She's strong," she said. "I need to get out. Let me find a way."

She scaled the gates and walls with her eyes, looking for footholds and niches to climb, but all the stones had been eroded to smooth nodules over countless sa'tova, impossible to climb. The wall continued into a stream, adorning a mask of moss and lichen but just as unclimbable. She squinted along the wall into the distance, searching for an opening, but the line gave to none but the fishing harbor. _Perhaps a boat._

"Laen. Listen carefully," she said slowly to him. Laen let out a worried "woo" and listened intently through the gate.

"Our home is in trouble, and it's dangerous to be there. I need you to go home with Boon and warn everyone."

"Woop?" he said, confusedly.

"Wake everyone in the city up and have them bring the infants and elders to the far side of the observatory."

"Woop woop," he said confidently and Melna knew that he understood.

"Now go!"

With a pat on the neck and a few preparation stretches he took off along the bridge back toward Heiko.

"Good luck, Laen. I'll be with you soon."

She turned around and began to walk as quickly as she could toward the harbor.

She stopped just short at the first sign of three rudjan officials, and blended in behind a porter waiting for hae merchant with far too many boxes. The officials were customs inspectors by look, patrolling the island that connected the markets to the fishers' quarter. _Usually they stay in the port_.

One of them was taking her frustration out on an older maman.

"They came right through here. How could you miss them?" She said.

"I honestly wasn't looking."

"A pair of glowing eyes and wounds all over hae body. You don't miss someone like that."

"All kinds of people come through here, I don't-"

"This isn't just anyone. Thi could be working with the obscura. You better not be a sympathizer."

"N-no. I-"

"Then tell me where they went!"

She grasped the maman's hair but her partner pulled her away.

"This is going nowhere," he said, trying to talk calm her down.

"I can't be the only one who saw it," she argued, "And I don't take any of that kanosin shit."

"Maybe you did, but you've been searching all day with no leads. It's a dead end."

He and the other partner turned and started walking toward the customs house while she yelled at their backs, "Are you quitting? What if thi is one of them?"

She sulked in disbelief, staring back at them as the maman she tormented lay knealing before her, holding hae head in pain. With a sneer, she took off toward the harbor, perhaps to "search" for more clues.

After the inspectors left, Melna approached the poor maman while the porter gave nary a glance.

"Hey, are you ok?" She asked, reaching her hand out to the maman's shoulder. Thi looked up at her with uncertain eyes, but a smile of gratitude.

"I'll be fine. I'm just a bit shaken."

"What were they on about back there?" she asked, crouching to see hae closer.

"'Spector thinks she saw a ghost," thi said as if it were expected.

"And they harassed a stranger about it?"

"This is Rudjan; strength and money are the law."

"Where I come from, the law is recorded and interpretted by philosophers."

"And where might that be, darling?"

She glanced around for anyone who might seize her for what she was about to say and under her breath she uttered, "I am from Heiko."

The maman was a bit confused but said, "Are you afraid someone will hear you? They say your government was keeping secrets, but I don't buy it. What does another few days in the dark buy you but more misery? Better to die quickly."

Melna smiled a bit. "You're the first person I've met that believes we are innocent," she said. "Many even from Heiko are unsure."

"Ah. Fear does bring out the worst in people."

Thi finally was able to stand up with Melna's help.

"Thank you, darling."

She hesitated and introduced herself, "Mel-", she rethought her words, "ka. Melka."

"Melka. A beautiful name," thi said. "I'm Shinna. My ship is at the northernmost dock. We're about to depart, but come find me if you're ever in the area."

"Actually," she said tactfully, "I'm looking for a way back home."

"Oh. I am no smuggler, but perhaps..." thi smiled, and then it sank as she stared off into the sky.

"No. It's too dangerous," she said hurriedly.

She pleaded to hae, "I would be immensely indebted to you."

"And you will die before you can repay it."

She leaned in close and took hae hands in her own.

"If this is about Holrag, then I know what I'm getting into."

"Why, then, do you insist on going home?"

"To save my people."

"It's impossible. They're blockading the peninsula by land and sea. No one can leave or enter.

"Just take me halfway then. I can make the rest."

"You will die."

"As opposed to a few more days in the dark?"

The air contemplated its silence.

"I charge extra for you fancy folk you know." Thi nodded to Melna's senate robes that were visible from a crack in her bag. They shared a smirk and Shinna took her hand to lead her to hae ship.

It was larger than she had imagined, outfitted with two large foldable sails on each side and three pairs of risers for power in a headwind. The forward hull was adorned with brand new plates of steel which set the ship low in the water. But the crew didn't seem to mind it as they played some sort of game on a crate on the dock.

"What are those plates for?" She asked Shinna as she got closer.

"Ice. The ocean is full of it now. We need something to break through the larger chunks so they don't damage the rest of the boat."

"Ice? In the ocean?"

"There's always been an ice line but it is far beyond where most explorers have gone. Ever since the obscura, it's been moving closer as the skywinds from the desert lose their speed and heat."

Melna was in awe at Shinna's depth of knowledge, chocking it up to one of the many things a kelper needs to know to survive in the ocean.

"Crew!", Shinna addressed the crowd of around twenty. The volume of her voice shocked Melna out of her daydream. "This is uh.." Thi leaned toward Melna, trying to remember her name.

"Mel-", she hinted to hae, "Belka!" thi shouted confidently. "This is Belka."

"Oy," They all greeted her. She was too paranoid about her identity to correct Shinna, but also too amused to mind.

"She'll be joining us for a short time on today's voyage."

"You bring us anything?" a maman from the group shouted at her. She flushed red in embarassment, not knowing that she would be expected to bring something.

"We've taken in enough freeloaders, Shinna. When do we start getting a cut for our generosity?"

"That's not how generosity works," thi responded.

A younger woman from the group rebuked hae, "Then what's the point? We all need something to live on."

Melna glanced at an exapserated Shinna, who was looking for answers as much as she was.

Melna offered them a deal. "I... have very little with me. But I can ensure an eternal welcome to all of you amongst the people of Heiko."

"A welcome, eh?" the skeptical woman said. "What sort of promise is that?"

Her mind raced to find an answer, but none came to mind.

"Sounds empty to me," said the maman.

Shinna spoke up, "Enough. You'll barely notice her. She'll be in stowage."

"With the rest of the garbage," said the woman.

Shinna didn't respond but led Melna past the crew. She shared a glance with a man who had been sitting in the back. He didn't recognize her, but she could never forget the face of the man who stormed out of the conduit, and of those blue eyes peering from beneath the satchel. She would maintain her vigilance.

Melna found a clearing to sit in amongst the tarred crates and oiled bags in stowage. The room was dark save for a few round portholes, but she resolved to endure the journey as it would only be for a short time. _A short time_, she repeated to herself to convince her reluctant mind. There were countless muffles of footsteps, shouts, and machinery coming alive above as they began to push off from the dock and toward the rails to Heiko.

Her mind wandered to Kipnu, remembering how fearless he was through his sentencing and even in the stories that Linyu told her about him. And Liffa who she heard from the furthest reaches of the void, still living breath by breath. She clutched her pendant, and imagined they could share some of their courage through it.

Through the porthole, she eyed the bridge over the delta and the faint glimmer of the train rail in the distance. Her mind wandered to Laen, Pomri, Linyu, and it sunk once more into anguish. She had led them to Rudjan, and Rudjan had divided them all. She focused on the listener, once again searching for answers in the static, but it was just static, and she was just alone in the darkness. At least, she believed that she was.

"Who are you?" a quiet voice pierced the silence.

Melna was startled to her feet at the invisible voice. She looked around but saw neither stirring nor looking.

"Who was that?" she asked, still scanning the room.

She saw a satchel rustling in the corner, and from it a pair of light blue eyes emerged staring at her.

"Linyu?" she asked, and the voice let out a gasp, as if knowing the name. Melna realized they were both afraid of saying anything, but she imagined that hiding yourself in a satchel in the dark was a much more vulnerable state of mind, so she went first.

"My name is Melna. I met a kaln named Linyu last evening with eyes quite similar to yours."

"This kaln... also has blue eyes?"

Melna cautiously walked closer to hae while thi crawled out of the hiding bag. Through the darkness, she could see the outline of the maman's unclothed body and the soft rays of Ara landing on her skin. Her wrinkles revealed that thi was severely dehydrated, and Melna immediately withdrew her canteen to give hae a drink. The maman was wary of the strange object Melna was handing hae, but quickly bowed to desparation when thi realized that the object was a canteen, and took it eagerly.

"Are you from Ulukoma," Melna asked.

"I think so?"

"What happened to Kipnu?"

"Kipnu?" thi seemed more confused than before.

Melna apologized, "I'm sorry. He is my jundman, and... I was... Nobody knows what happened to him."

"I have no memories," thi said, beginning to cry, "I only know that I woke up yesterday on this ship, in this satchel, blind and bruised. I met Ramne who was... unhappy when I first met him... And now I've met you."

"Are you injured?" Melna asked, recalling the wound on hae head.

"Yes, I think it's why I don't have any memories. But it doesn't seem infected or anything."

"Here, let me see."

Melna gently pulled hae closer to the light and observed even more bruises and wounds and scars across hae whole body.

"My goodness. How did you get all of these?" Melna asked as she pressed gently on a few healing cuts to see if they had gone numb. Thi winced uneasily at each one.

"I don't know," thi said, "But whoever I was, I don't want to be hae anymore."

Melna smiled and said, "I'm glad," but silently she knew that she had to get hae away from him.

"Come with me to Heiko," Melna asked.

"What? Why?"

"I think you're in danger."

"But... I've heard there's danger in Heiko as well."

"Yes. Terrible danger, but we can escape and-"

"You can't escape it. The danger is from above."

"Above?-"

"Hope I'm not interrupting anything", called Ramne, opening a door to the stowage deck.

His voice struck fear in the maman's heart, and thi ran back toward the satchel to hide. Melna stood her ground between them.

"You look familiar", he said as he got sight of Melna, "Have I run into you before?"

"If you did, I would have said something."

"Maybe I didn't hear you."

"Maybe you didn't listen."

"You know, you seem an awful lot like a man I used to know. Thought he was above everyone. Above me." he paused to lean on a pillar next to him and look closer at Melna, "Didn't work out so well for him."

She eyed him up and down, and felt a wave of disgust wash over her.

"Why don't you take your stories somewhere else?"

"Ah I see. Why am I even here?" he asked disingenuously. "Well I figured you'd have met my litle blue-eyed monster by now, and well, that bothers me a little bit." He moved from the pillar, closer to Melna, and stood facing her eye-to-eye.

"Caus I rather like keeping that thing a secret."

"Thi's a throngia. Just like the rest of us."

He laughed, "Sure thi looks just like one of us. That's because thi used to be."

He reached for the satchel behind Melna, but she pushed him away.

"Heh. Maybe you're one of them too."

"One of who?"

He walked toward her and tried to lift her by the shirt, to which she promptly responded with a punch in the abdomen. But his clothing was thicker than she imagined and it cushioned the impact of her hit. He calmly shrugged it off and threw her to the side, then grabbed the satchel again and lifted the blue-eyed maman out of it by hae hair, holding hae face over Melna's like a puppet.

"Let me tell you a story. A maman named Ginnu used to own this body. But one day thi died because that fucking idiot sent her into the dark alone. Thi fell three stories onto a metal floor, and screamed in pain while he tried to save hae."

Melna could hear Ramne but could only see the maman's anguish through hae face. Thi wasn't dead, thi was alive.

He continued to mock them, "This _thing_ is a demon. An abomination to life! I wish I could kill it, but it _just won't die_!"

Melna stood back up and away from them, and he dropped the maman on the floor sparing no time to do so carefully. She looked around for a weapon, but it was too dark to see. Ramne barreled toward her so she dodged his lunge and made a break for the stairs to the upper deck. But before she could reach the top, a hand grabbed her ankle and pulled her hard onto the step where she landed on her head-
