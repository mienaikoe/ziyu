## Chapter 19

Melna's fervid limbs slipped through the crowds of Rudjani who remained blissfully ignorant and powerless to the greater changes happening around them. It was clear that nothing could stop them from filling the docks of the merchant's quarter. They would sooner go hungry than surrender their sense of normalcy. A feeling of disdain washed over her for their ignorance, but she reminded herself of the law of self-determination. That one's impulse is merely the a result of the world around them, and Melna was partially responsible for that.

She was cautious as she approached the gate. There weren't any signs of a trap, but the quiet and the absence of merchants gave her pause.

She called from the inside, "Fanla...", but there was no response nor sign of anyone. She glanced at a strange wooden object on the ground near the gate and found Fanla's listener, placed gently on the ground, out of the way of passing feet. From the direction of the bridge, the sound of footsteps and a coy man's voice broke the silence. Melna hid in between gates, sitting casually against the wall so as to avoid suspicion, but listening intently to the voices on the other side.

"You're the 'sworn keeper' of the south gate?" he asked.

Bavle responded with a tone of defiance. "My oath is to the land of Rudjan, not to you."

"The land," he scoffed an Melna imagined a smirk, "Let's see if the land can save you in prison."

"Those women weren't hurting anyone, they just wanted to go home."

"That's not for you to decide. Soldiers, you know what to do."

_Neither fear of death nor promise of reward_, Melna recalled Bavle's pride in that declaration and a wave of dread washed over her. The sound of an unsheathing sword punctured the air, followed by two others, and Melna got up to look. Bavle was in a defensive stance with her sword glistening in the reddened Ara light. The way she stood, it was as if she'd fought a thousand battles and practiced ten thousand more.

The man scoffed at her again. "You think you can threaten me with that decorative stick you call a sword? It's duller than that old head of yours."

Bavle smirked. "I could take you down with my bare hands but a stick would be more fun."

The three jumped into their match, and Melna looked for a lever or a rope, hoping there was more than one way to move the gate. She found no switch, but took up a few chunks of brick that had broken off from the wall and waited for an opening. Bavle was unfettered by the soldiers' advances, dodging each of their attacks with a swift and steady bend of her body. It was apparent that her age had no bearing on her acuity.

The strange man looking on was becoming impatient. He reached for something in his breastpocket but before he had a firm grip, a rock struck his knee and caused him to yell in pain. The soldiers were distracted by the commotion, and Bavle took the opportunity to land quick slashing blows to their inner legs, sending them to the ground. But before she could move to her last target, an explosion erupted from his hand and she felt a disturbance in the air near her face. She turned and ran as quickly as she could as he pointed a strange metal pipe at her. Melna threw another rock and knocked the pipe clean from his hand and into the water below.

"Keepers, get that woman!" he cried, and suddenly two people ran from a kelping ship toward Melna. Without hesitation, she ran swiftly away from them toward the harbor. She was keenly aware of how little time she had: the entire city was becoming an elaborate trap and like a fish caught in a net, it was only a matter of time.

She scaled the gates and walls with her eyes, looking for openings and niches to hide in, but the wall was built flat in every way, and dutifully maintained over countless generations. Even the streams to and from the wetlands outside traveled a torturous path of steel bars spanning the thickness of the wall.

_A ship will have to do_, she thought.

She rounded a corner of the wall, temporarily putting her out of site of her pursuers, and stumbled onto a small dock that ran parallel to the harbor. A small island with a garden interrupted the dock about ten paces ahead, so she quietly slipped herself into the water and swam toward that shoreline. Through the water, she could see the passing of four feet between the wooden planks. She stopped just short of the island, still hidden by the pier above her, and watched them from afar.

One had the demeanor of a hard-worker, the portrait of a man whose zealotry for the ideals of justice kept him trapped in his job. He had an angry mumbling tone to match as he addressed a maman who stood in the garden.

"Speak, maman! Where did she go?"

"Who?"

He was held back by his calmer partner, a taller woman of cleaner look and sharper thought.

"She came right through here. You couldn't have missed her."

"I wasn't looking," thi told them with a confident tone, neither defensive nor pleading.

"She's a woman in fine Heikoan dress. You don't miss someone like that."

"All sorts of people come through here, I wouldn't have-"

The man. "This isn't just anyone. She could be a spy. You better not be a sympathizer!"

He charged in and grasped the maman's hair, but the other pulled him away.

"Just tell us where she went," she said, "and you won't have to deal with us anymore."

The maman sighed as if annoyed by these petulant children bothering hae. "Perhaps you'd like to bring these baseless accusations to the Clerk of Trade? Surely he'd help you more than I."

The keeper paused and measured the weight of hae challenge.

"This is going nowhere," said the impatient keeper. "I can't be the only one who saw her come this way. And I don't take any of that kanosin shit."

"Maybe you did. Maybe you didn't," she said. "Either way, it's a dead end."

She started walking back to the gate while her partner yelled at her, "Are you quitting? What if she's that fidelant we've been looking for?"

He sulked in disbelief, as the maman he tormented stood behind him, holding hae head in pain. With a sneer, he took off toward the harbor, leaving the maman to the garden.

"It's clear now," thi said to the air, and Melna paused as if to wonder if thi was talking to her. Slowly, she moved away from the dock and approached the maman with caution.

She saw hae holding hae head. "Hey, are you ok?" she asked, reaching her hand out to the maman's shoulder. Thi looked up at her with a face that had long internalized the folly of trust. But hae mouth still mustered a smile of gratitude.

"It will take them a bit more than some roughing to hurt me," thi said.

Though it was dark, Melna could clearly see the features of hae face. Thi had round cheeks and a small nose, but hae eyes and hair were more clever than any she'd seen before.

"How could they harass you like that?"

"This is Rudjan; strength and money are the law."

"Where I come from, the law is decided and enforced by the community."

"And where might that be, darling?"

She glanced around for anyone who might have a keen interest in her origin.

"I am from Heiko," she said quietly.

The maman was a bit confused but said, "Are you afraid the keepers will hear you? They're gone now."

"Yes, but... there are always more."

"This little garden island has no place to hide but the very place you found. Nobody would give this place a second thuoght."

Melna felt a little safer with hae, but kept a conscious eye on the docks for anything lurking in the shadows.

"They told us your government was hoarding grain," thi said, "but I don't buy it. What would a little bit of extra food buy you? You're still going to die."

Melna did not admire hae cynicism, but appreciated it nonetheless. "You're the first person I've met that believes in us," she said. "Many even from Heiko are unsure."

"Fear leads to foolish thoughts and desparate decisions."

Melna offered hae some water from her canteen and thi accepted it graciously.

"Thank you, darling."

Melna hesitated to introduced herself, but decided it was in her best interest to make at least one ally at this point in her journey.

"I'm Mel-", she rethought her words, "ka. Melka."

"Me'ka. A wonderful name," said the maman. "I'm Shimba, guardian and captain of the Silver Saffa. We're about the depart to Yansha, but, I think we have room for one more."

"Actually," she said graciously, "I _am_ looking for a way back home."

"To Heiko?"

"Yes."

"But we're going to Yansha."

"I understand, but I hoped that you might take a desparate fidelant to Heiko on the way."

"No. It's too dangerous," thi said, seeming uncomfortable for the first time. Melna figured that thi didn't want to let on what she already knew.

"I know the danger that lies ahead. Whatever you think I'm blind to, I assure you, I know."

"Then why do you insist on going back?"

"To save my people."

"You can save your people from a safe distance."

"They would dismiss me as a coward before I could say anything."

"That's their problem."

"No, it's mine too. I've dedicated my life to the problems of the Heikoi. They've pledged their fidelity to me, and I to them. If it takes my life to win back their trust and save theirs, then I would gladly make that exchange."

She kneeled close and took hae hands in her own, pleading to hae for help. "Please take me to Heiko. I would be immensely indebted to you."

"And you will die before you can repay it."

"I assure you, you will be paid without regard to my–"

The maman shushed her and looked around for some keeper or spy lying in wait.

"You're asking me to do something impossible," thi said. "The whole peninsula will be blockaded. No one can leave or enter."

"Blockaded?" Melna was incredulous. This was no longer just a simple evacuation. "Just take me halfway then. I can make up the rest on foot."

"Do you understand what a blockade is? A wall of soldiers and ships stands between you and your people, and they would love nothing more than to turn your death into a show of force."

The air was still and filled with tension. Melna looked through her mind at all of the imaginings of her own end, and, for just a moment, thought of her own self-preservation over the safety of her people. Perhaps someone in the Heiko intelligence network knew of the blockade. Perhaps Pomri and Linyu and Fanla would make it to Heiko in time to prepare everyone. Or perhaps not. The thought turned her stomach.

"Alright I'll take you," said Shimba with some reluctance. Melna's face lit up with excitement. "I'll find some way through the blockade, but for now keep your head down and your wits about you."

Melna took Shimba's hand and hae face showed that thi too understood how important this was. Without a word, the two walked cautiously toward the harbor piers, looking around every corner for any keepers that might be lurking about. Melna felt a peculiar sense of dread and worry with each step, as if she'd left something between them unspoken. "Shimba," Melna began, "I hope you don't mind me asking, but why are you helping me? A Rudjani merchant always negotiates, but you haven't."

Thi looked at her with surprise and an expression of earnest importance.

"My time has come and passed. Peoples' lives have passed through my ledger, and let's just say not all of them were in the righteous light of Ara."

Hae eyes were narrowed into a scowl as if remembering something painful.

"Call it atonement, if you will. Of a rebellious kind."

Melna usually knew a truth from a lie, but this one she couldn't decipher.

"Well, shall we?" asked Shimba.

It was larger than she had imagined, outfitted with four large foldable sails, two to a side, and three pairs of risers for power in a headwind. The forward hull was adorned with brand new plates of steel which set the ship low in the water. But the crew didn't seem bothered by the clearly worrisome display as they played some sort of game on a crate on the dock.

"What are those plates for?" She asked Shimba as she got closer.

"Ice. The ocean is full of it now. We need something to break through the larger chunks so they don't damage the rest of the boat."

"Ice? In the ocean?"

"There's always been an ice line but it is far beyond where most explorers have gone. Ever since the obscura, it's been moving closer as the skywinds from the desert lose their speed and heat."

Melna was in awe at Shimba's depth of knowledge, chocking it up to one of the many things a kelper needs to know to survive in the ocean.

"Crew!", Shimba addressed the crowd of around twenty. The volume of hae voice shocked Melna out of her daydream. "This is uh.." Thi leaned toward Melna, trying to remember her name.

"Melka-", she hinted to hae, "Belka!" thi shouted confidently. "This is Belka."

They all greeted her out of sync with boisterous "Oy!"s and "Ai!"s. She was too paranoid about her identity to correct Shimba, but also too amused to mind.

"Belka will be joining us for a trip to Heiko before Yansha."

"Heiko?" A maman approached the two, doing a once over of Melna with a disgusted look before thi ignored her and addressed Shimba. Thi spoke under hae breath but Melna could still hear hae.

"Have you gone mad?" thi asked. Melna thought that her cover might have been blown, but Shimba remained unfazed, unwavering.

"Oh shut up, Panna," Shimba snapped in an oddly reassuring way. "Your worries will kill you before anything else gets a chance."

Thi shot back, "Maybe if you weren't so obsessed with that maman from Rudj–"

"– We'll take Belka just short of the blockade, and then be on our way. You'll hardly notice her."

Panna made a strange sound with the tips of hae tongue, then turned hae gaze toward Melna.

"You bring us anything?" thi demanded. Melna's cheeks flushed in embarassment, not knowing that she would be expected to bring something.

"Didn't think so. People like you get everything handed to you. Our generosity doesn't come for free."

"That's not how generosity works," Shimba said.

"Then what's the point?" Panna turned back to Shimba. "We all need something to live on."

Melna saw the exapserated look on both of their faces, searched for some answer to quell their needs.

She offered them a deal. "I... have very little with me. But I can ensure an eternal welcome to all of you amongst the people of Heiko."

"A welcome, eh?" said Panna. "That supposed to impress us?"

Her mind raced to find an answer, but none came to mind.

"Empty. See? This Heikoi brings nothing but her own problems."

"Enough!" Shimba yelled at her and shoved her back to her old spot. "We're going to the blockade. She'll be in stowage the whole time. That's final!"

"With the rest of the overpriced garbage," said Panna with a smirk. Thi walked away in silent concession.

Melna followed Shimba past the crew, felt the glare of judgment from every person there, and knew that this was no safe place. She would maintain her vigilance.

Melna found a clearing amongst the tarred crates and oiled bags in the stowage area below deck. The space was dark save for a few round glass windows to the outside, but Shimba had promised there was a lantern somewhere, that she only had to look. _A short time_, she repeated to herself to convince her reluctant mind.

Through the muffle of a wooden celing came the sound of innumerable footsteps; of people shouting, and machinery clanking; the well-tuned psyche of a team coming alive as they began to push off from the dock. They cleared the harbor and a subtle scraping sound filled the air outside as the engine below her whirred alive, vibrating the whole ship with its starting. They were on the path toward Heiko.

Melna's mind wandered to Kipnu, remembering how fearless he was through his sentencing and even in the stories that Linyu told her about him. And Liffa who she had heard from the furthest reaches of the void, still living breath by breath. She removed Fanla's listener from her satchel and lifted it onto her ear, once again searching for some sign of Liffa, but there was nothing but static. Her fingers moved to her pendant instead, and imagined some otherworldly strength hidden inside that could be conjured from its curves and niches.

She moved to a window and eyed the bridge over the wetland delta, still proudly stretching across the horizon as the idle train rail rested in the distance. Her mind wandered to Fanla and her soothing voice, to Pomri and Linyu and Laen, and she sunk once more into anguish. She had led them to Rudjan, and Rudjan had divided them all. And now she was alone in the darkness.

At least, she believed that she was.

From the corner of her eye, she saw the slightest movement of a large woven bag that was haphazardly placed in the corner of two crates. It was strangely alive – not the movement you'd expect of something moving with the ship but in spite of it. She got up and took careful steps to walk toward it.

"Who are you?" an invisible voice pierced the silence.

Melna was startled. "Are you hiding?" she asked, still eyeing the bag. It began to rustle and a pair of illuminated eyes emerged from the top and stared at her knees.

"Linyu?" she said, but the figure didn't respond, and slowly the features of a strange maman became more obvious. Hae hair was knotted and unkempt, and hae face was weary with exhaustion.

"How did you come to have eyes like that?" Melna asked in a kinder voice, but still thi didn't respond.

Melna was reminded of the maman with blue eyes on the strange man's canoe and wondered if this scared maman was one in the same. She checked first for the presence of some figure of a man she might've missed, casing the area near them, but saw nothing.

"My name is Melna," she said coming back to the maman, "I met a kaln last evening with eyes quite similar to yours."

"This kaln... also has blue eyes?"

Melna cautiously moved her hand closer while thi crawled out of the hiding bag. Through the darkness, she could see the outline of the maman's body and the soft rays of Ara landing on hae skin. Hae skin was thin, nearly void of water, and Melna immediately withdrew her canteen to give hae a drink. The maman was wary of the strange object Melna was handing hae, but quickly bowed to desparation when thi realized that the object was full of water, and took it eagerly.

"Are you from Ulukoma?" Melna asked.

"I think so?"

"Have you met a man named Kipnu?"

"Kipnu?" thi seemed more confused than before.

Melna apologized, "I'm sorry. He is my jundman, and I was hoping that you might have..." She paused. Hearing herself say it out loud made her realize how ridiculous her question must have been.

"I have no memories," thi said, beginning to cry, "I only know that I woke up yesterday on this ship, in this itchy bag. I was blind and had a terrible headache. I met a man named Ramne who was... quite unhappy when I first met him... We went into a town of some sort... at least I think we did? But now I've met you."

"Are you injured?" Melna asked, recalling the wound on hae head.

"Yes, on my head. I think it's why I don't have any memories."

"Here, let me see."

Melna gently pulled hae closer to the light through the window and saw a strange circular ridge marking on hae head, but nothing that might suggest there was a wound there. But the rest of hae body told a different story; There were bruises and wounds marring hae arms and torso, as if she'd been in a horrible struggle of some sort.

"My goodness. How did you get all of these?" Melna asked as she pressed gently near a few of the newer wounds to feel for any foreign objects. Thi winced uneasily at each one.

"I don't know," thi said, "But whoever I was before, I don't want to be hae anymore."

Melna felt her face flush with sorrow. She told hae, "Your body is a vessel for the many lives that may fill and empty through it. Whatever may have filled it before does not affect the indominable spirit that fills it now."

The maman smiled. "I've never hear something so pretty," thi said with a cracked voice. "I hope the rest of the world is so beautiful when I get to see it."

Melna smiled and fought back the deepest sorrow she'd ever felt.

"Come with me to Heiko," Melna begged hae. "I think you're in terrible danger."

"But... I've heard there's danger in Heiko as well."

"Yes. Terrible danger, but we can escape and build a new life somewhere else."

"Escape?"

"Hope I'm not interrupting anything", called a man's voice. The sound struck fear in the maman's heart, and thi hid haeself under the fabric of hae old home while Melna walked toward it. He stood at the top of a stairwell that led to the engine room below, his figure traced out by the dim red of Ara through a window.

"You look familiar", he said as he got sight of Melna, "Have I run into you before?"

"So you don't remember me yelling at you?"

"Maybe I didn't hear you."

"Maybe you didn't listen."

"You know, you seem an awful lot like a man I used to know. Thought he was above everyone around him." he paused to lean on a pillar next to him and look closer at Melna, "Didn't work out so well for him."

She felt a wave of disdain wash over her.

"Sounds like you're no better off, stowing away in the engine room of some old sailing ship."

He laughed, "Shinna thinks thi runs this ship. But it won't be long before thi understand who's really in charge."

He took two steps toward Melna, coming uncomfortably close to her and stood facing her eye-to-eye.

"But don't worry about hae. Worry about yourself. Because you just met my little blue-eyed monster, and that bothers me. I rather like keeping that thing a secret."

"Thi is a person. Just like the rest of us."

"Sure it looks just like one of us. But it isn't."

He reached for the bag where the maman hid, but Melna stopped him and pushed him away with his own weight.

"Heh," he laughed off her move. "Maybe you're one of them too."

"One of who?"

He walked toward her and tried to lift her by the shirt, to which she promptly responded with a punch in the ribs. But his clothing was thicker than she imagined and it cushioned the impact of her hit. He calmly shrugged it off and threw her to the ground, then grabbed the bag again and lifted the blue-eyed maman out of it by hae hair, holding hae face over Melna's like a puppet. The blue light of hae eyes filled hey sight and illuminated his face as he spoke.

"Let me tell you a story. A maman named Ginnu used to own this body, but Ginnu died trying to betray me. That guy turned all of them against me, so I did what I had to do. This _thing_ is the demon that woke up in hae body, an abomination to life. I tried to kill it, but it _just won't die_!"

Melna stared into the maman's eyes, and felt hae pain and her anguish. Thi wasn't dead, thi was alive. She backed away, still lying on the ground, and he dropped the maman hard on the floor. She searched in the dark for a weapon, but there was nothing but barrels and bags far too heavy to move. Ramne suddenly lunged for her but she dodged out of the way just in time and ran for the stairs to the upper deck. But before she could reach the top, a hand grabbed her ankle and sent her tumbling back down.

The weight of a body pinned her down as a damp cloth covered her face. She fought to push him off of her, but it wasn't long before the last light of consciousness left her eyes, leaving only that sickening look of a madman's face seared into her memory.
