## Chapter 19

  "Woop?" cried Laen from the left-most gate.

  "Laen-Laen!" Melna responded with joy. She hurried over to him and asked, "Are you ok? Do you know where Bavle is?"

  He appeared in a good state but shook his head in denial and worry for Bavle. Melna comforted him with a gentle scratch on his forehead.

  "It's ok. She's strong," she said. "I need to get out. Let me find a way."

  She scaled the gates and walls with her eyes, looking for footholds and niches to climb, but all the stones had been eroded to smooth nodules over countless sa'tova, impossible to climb. The wall continued into a stream, adorning a mask of moss and lichen but just as unclimbable. She squinted along the wall into the distance, searching for an opening, but the line gave to none but the fishing harbor. *Perhaps a boat.*

  "Laen. Listen carefully," she said slowly to him. Laen let out a worried "woo" and listened intently through the gate.

  "Our home is in trouble, and it's dangerous to be there. I need you to go home and warn everyone."

  "Woop?" he said, confusedly.

  "Get everyone out of the city and into boats. We have to row into the darkness. It's our only chance."

  "Woop woop," he said confidently and Melna knew that he understood.

  "Now go!"

  With a pat on the neck and a few preparation stretches he took off along the bridge back toward Heiko.

  "Good luck, Laen. I'll be with you soon."

  She turned around and began to walk as quickly as she could toward the harbor.

  She stopped just short at the first sign of three rudjan officials, and blended in behind a porter waiting for hae merchant with far too many boxes. The officials were customs inspectors by look, patrolling the island that connected the markets to the fishers' quarter. *Usually they stay in the port*.

  One of them was taking her frustration out on an older maman. 
  
  "They came right through here. How could you miss them?" She said.
  
  "I honestly wasn't looking."

  "A pair of glowing eyes and wounds all over hae body. You don't miss someone like that."

  "All kinds of people come through here, I don't-"

  "This isn't just anyone. Thi could be working with the obscura. You better not be a sympathizer."

  "N-no. I-"

  "Then tell me where they went!"
  
  She grasped the maman's hair but her partner pulled her away. 
  
  "This is going nowhere," he said, trying to talk calm her down.

  "I can't be the only one who saw it," she argued, "And I don't take any of that kanosin shit."

  "Maybe you did, but you've been searching all day with no leads. It's a dead end."

  He and the other partner turned and started walking toward the customs house while she yelled at their backs, "So we just quit? What if she's one of them?"

  She sulked in disbelief, staring back at them as the maman she tormented lay knealing before her, holding hae head in pain. With a sneer, she took off toward the harbor, perhaps to "search" for more clues. 
  
  After the inspectors left, Melna approached the poor maman while the porter gave nary a glance.

  "Hey, are you ok?" She asked, reaching her hand out to the maman. Thi looked up at her with uncertain eyes, but a smile of gratitude.

  "I'll be fine. I'm just a bit shaken."

  "What were they on about back there?" she asked.

  "'Spector thinks she saw a ghost," thi said as if it were a perfectly normal thing.

  "And they harassed a stranger about it?"

  "This is Rudjan; strength is the law. That and money."

  "Where I come from, the people are the law."

  "And where might that be, darling?"

  "I'm from Heiko."

  "Oh I know Heiko. I go there to sell kelp and restock on our outgoing voyages. They say your government was keeping secrets, but I don't buy it. What does another few days in the dark buy you but more misery? Better to die quickly."

  Melna smiled a bit. "You're the first person I've met that believes we are innocent," she said. "Many even from Heiko are unsure."

  "Ah. Fear does bring out the worst in people."

  Thi finally was able to stand up with Melna help.

  "Thank you, darling."

  She hesitated and introduced herself, "Mel-", she rethought her words, "ka. Melka."

  "Melka. A beautiful name. I'm Shinna," thi told her proudly, "My ship is at the northernmost dock. We're about to go on a voyage, but come find me if you're ever looking for a fresh catch."

  "Great to meet you, Shinna. Actually, I am looking to get back home."

  "Oh. I am no smuggler, but perhaps..." thi smiled, and then it sank as she stared off into the sky.

  "No. It's too dangerous," she said hurriedly.

  She pleaded to hae, "I would be immensely indebted to you."

  "And your life would be a debt that I could never repay to you."

  She leaned in close and took hae hands in her own.

  "If this is about Holragi, then I know what I'm getting into."

  "Why, then, do you insist on going home?"

  "To save my people."

  "It's impossible. They're blockading the peninsula by land and sea. No one can leave or enter.

  "Just take me halfway then. I can make the rest."

  "You will die."

  "As opposed to a few more days in the dark?"

  The air contemplated its silence.

  "I charge extra for you fancy folk you know." Thi nodded to Melna's senate robes that were visible from a crack in her bag. They shared a smirk and Shinna took her hand to lead her to hae ship.

  It was larger than she had imagined, outfitted with two large foldable sails on each side and three pairs of risers for power in a headwind. The forward hull was adorned with brand new plates of steel which set the ship low in the water. But the crew didn't seem to mind it as they played some sort of game on a crate on the dock.

  "What are those plates for?" She asked Shinna as she got closer.

  "Ice. The ocean is full of it now. We need something to break through the larger chunks so they don't damage the rest of the boat."

  "Ice? In the ocean?"

  "There's always been an ice line but it is far beyond where most explorers have gone. Ever since the obscura, it's been moving closer as the skywinds from the desert lose their speed and heat."

  Melna was in awe at Shinna's depth of knowledge, chocking it up to one of the many things a kelper needs to know to survive in the ocean.

  "Crew!", Shinna addressed the crowd of around twenty. The volume of her voice shocked Melna out of her daydream. "This is uh.." Thi leaned toward Melna, trying to remember her name.

  "Mel-", she hinted to hae, "-ba!" thi shouted confidently. "This is Melba."

  "Melba!" They all welcomed her. She was too paranoid about her identity to correct them, but also too amused to mind.
  
  "She'll be joining us for a short time on today's voyage."

  "You bring us anything?" a maman from the group shouted at her. She flushed red in embarassment, not knowing that she had to bring something.

  "We've taken in enough freeloaders, Shinna. When do we start getting a cut for our generosity?"

  "That's not how generosity works."

  A younger woman from the group rebuked hae, "Then what's the point? We all need something."

  Melna glanced at an exapserated Shinna, who was looking for answers as much as she was. She decided to speak.
  
  "I... have very little with me," she told the group. "But I can ensure an eternal welcome to you all amongst the people of Heiko."

  "A welcome, eh?" the skeptical woman said. "What sort of promise is that?"

  Her mind raced to find an answer, but none came to mind.

  "Sounds empty to me," said the maman.

  Shinna spoke up, "Enough. You'll barely notice her onboard. She'll be in stowage."

  "With the rest of the garbage," said the woman.

  Shinna didn't respond but led Melna past the crew. She shared a glance with a man who had been sitting in the back. He didn't recognize her, but she could never forget the face of the man who stormed out of the conduit, and of those blue eyes peering from beneath the satchel. She was no longer safe.

*************

  Melna was given a space amongst the tarred crates in stowage. It was dimly lit by a few round windows, but she resolved to endure as it would only be for a short time. *A short time*, she repeated to herself to convince her reluctant mind. There were countless muffles of footsteps, shouts, and machinery coming alive above as they began to push off from the dock and toward the rails to Heiko. 

  Through the window, she eyed the bridge over the delta and the faint glimmer of the train rail in the distance. Her mind wandered to Laen, Pomri, Linyu, and it sunk once more into anguish. She had led them to Rudjan, and Rudjan had divided them all. She focused on the listener, once again searching for answers in the static, but it was just static, and she was just alone in the darkness.

  "Who are you?"
  
  Melna was startled to her feet at the invisible voice. She looked around but saw neither stirring nor looking.

  "Who was that?" she asked, still scanning the room.

  She saw a satchel rustling in the corner, and from it a pair of light blue eyes emerged staring at her.

  "Linyu?" she asked, and the voice let out a gasp, as if knowing the name. Melna realized they were both afraid of saying anything, but she imagined that hiding yourself in a satchel in the dark was a much more vulnerable state to be in, so she went first.

  "My name is Melna. I met a kaln named Linyu last evening with eyes quite similar to yours."

  "This kaln... also has blue eyes?"

  Melna cautiously walked closer to her while she crawled out of her hiding bag. Through the darkness, she could see the outline of the woman's unclothed body and the soft rays of Ara landing on her skin. Her wrinkles revealed that she was severely dehydrated, and Melna immediately withdrew her canteen to give her a drink. The woman was wary of the strange object Melna was handing her, but quickly bowed to desparation when she realized that the object was a canteen, and she took it eagerly.

  "Are you from Ulukoma," Melna asked.
  
  "I think so?"

  "What happened to Kipnu?"

  "Kipnu?" she seemed more confused than before.

  Melna apologized, "I'm sorry. He is my jundman, and... I just. Nobody knows what happened to him."

  "I have no memories," she said, beginning to cry, "I only know that I woke up yesterday on this ship, in this satchel, naked and blind. I met Ramne who was very angry when I first met him... And now I've met you."

  "Are you injured?" Melna asked, recalling the wound on her head.

  "Yes, I think it's why I don't have any memories. But it doesn't seem infected or anything."

  "Here, let me see."
  
  Melna gently pulled her closer to the light and observed even more bruises and wounds and scars across her whole body.

  "My goodness. How did you get all of these?" Melna asked as she pressed gently on a few healing cuts to see if they had gone numb. She winced uneasily at each one.

  "I don't know," she said, "But whoever I was, I don't want to be her anymore."

  Melna smiled and said, "I'm glad," but silently she knew that she had to get her away from him.
  
  "Come with me to Heiko," Melna asked.

  "What? Why?"

  "I think you're in danger."

  "But... I've heard there's danger in Heiko as well."

  "Yes. Terrible danger, but we can escape and-"

  "You can't escape it. The danger is from above."

  "Above?-"

  "Hope I'm not interrupting anything", called Ramne, opening a door to the stowage deck.
  
  His voice struck fear in the woman's heart, and she ran back toward the satchel to hide. Melna stood her ground in front of her.

  "You look familiar", he said as he got sight of Melna, "Have I run into you before?"

  "If you did, I would have said something."

  "Maybe I didn't hear you."

  "Maybe you didn't listen."

  "You know, you seem an awful lot like a man I used to know. He wasn't very good at listening either. I think," he paused to lean on a pillar next to him, "it's just our nature not to listen."

  She eyed him up and down, and felt a wave of disgust wash over her.

  "You must be one of those men who can't take a hint."

  "Ah I see. You want to cut to the chase so quickly. Well I figured you'd have met my blue-eyed monster by now, and that just bothers me, you know?" He moved from the pillar, closer to Melna, and stood facing her eye-to-eye.

  "Caus I rather like keeping it a secret."

  "She's a throngia. Just like the rest of us."

  He laughed, "Oh ok. So you don't know what she really is. I guess I came down here for nothing then."

  He reached for the satchel behind Melna, but she dodged and punched him in the abdomen, which he calmly shrugged off and threw her to the ground. He looked at the satchel again and lifted the woman out of it by the hair, holding her face over Melna's like a puppet.

  "I'll let you in on a little secret. Ginnu used to own this body but then she died caus that fucking idiot sent her into the dark alone. She bled out after braining herself on a metal floor."

  Melna could hear Ramne but could only see the woman's anguish through her face. She wasn't dead, she was alive.

  He continued to mock them, "This *thing* is an affront to Ginnu. An abomination to life! I wish I could kill it, but it just won't die!"

  Melna stood back up and away from them, and he dropped the woman on the floor sparing no time to do so carefully. She looked around for a weapon, but it was too dark to see. Ramne barreled toward her so she dodged his lunge and made a break for the stairs to the upper deck.

  When she emerged into the light, she yelled "Shinna!!" but Shinna was in front of her with a disappointed look on hae face.

  Thi said, "You've brought nothing but yourself, so shall your body become payment."

  Melna's last sight of Shinna was at the top of those stairs, pushing her back down with a face that wore no emotion as she pleaded for hae to help.
