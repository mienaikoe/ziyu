## Chapter 19

Melna's fervid limbs slipped through the crowds of Rudjani who remained blissfully ignorant and powerless to the greater changes happening around them. It was clear that nothing could stop them from filling the docks of the merchant's quarter. They would sooner go hungry than surrender their sense of normalcy. A feeling of disdain washed over her for their ignorance, but she reminded herself of the law of self-determination. That one's impulse is merely the a result of the world around them, and Melna was partially responsible for that.

She was cautious as she approached the gate. There weren't any signs of a trap, but the quiet and the absence of merchants gave her pause.

She called from the inside, "Fanla...", but there was no response nor sign of anyone. From the direction of the bridge, the sound of footsteps and a coy man's voice broke the silence. Melna hid in between gates, sitting casually against the wall so as to avoid suspicion, but listening intently to the voices on the other side.

"You're the 'sworn keeper' of the south gate?" he asked.

Bavle responded with a tone of defiance. "My oath is to the land of Rudjan, not to you."

"The land," he scoffed an Melna imagined a smirk, "Let's see if the land can save you in prison."

"That woman wasn't hurting anyone, she just wanted to go home."

"That's not for you to decide. Soldiers, you know what to do."

_Neither fear of death nor promise of reward_, Melna recalled Bavle's pride in that declaration and a wave of dread washed over her. An unsheathing sword punctured the air, followed by two others, and Melna got up to look. Bavle was in a defensive stance with her sword glistening in the reddened Ara light. The way she stood, it was as if she'd fought a thousand battles and sparred with ten thousand more.

The man scoffed at her again. "You think you can threaten me with that decorative stick you call a sword? It's duller than that old head of yours."

"I could take you down with my bare hands but a stick would be more fun."

The three jumped into their match, and Melna looked for a lever or a rope, hoping there was more than one way to move the gate. She found no switch, but took up a few chunks of brick that had broken off from the wall and waited for an opening. Bavle was unfettered by the soldiers' advances, dodging each of their attacks with a swift and steady bend of her body. It was apparent that her age had no bearing on her acuity.

The strange man looking on was becoming impatient. He reached for something in his breastpocket but before he had a firm grip, a rock struck his knee and caused him to yell in pain. The soldiers were distracted by the commotion, and Bavle took the opportunity to land quick slashing blows to their inner legs, sending them to the ground. But before she could move to her last target, an explosion erupted from his hand and she felt a disturbance in the air near her face. She turned and ran as quickly as she could as he pointed a strange metal pipe at her. Melna threw another rock and knocked the pipe clean from his hand and into the water below.

"Keepers, get that woman!" he cried, and suddenly two people ran from a kelping ship toward Melna. Without hesitation, she ran swiftly away from them toward the harbor. She was keenly aware of how little time she had: the entire city was becoming an elaborate trap and like a fish caught in a net, it was only a matter of time.

She scaled the gates and walls with her eyes, looking for openings and niches to hide in, but the wall was built flat in every way, and dutifully maintained over countless generations. Even the streams to and from the wetlands outside traveled a torturous path of steel bars spanning the thickness of the wall.

_A ship will have to do_, she thought.

She rounded a corner of the wall, temporarily putting her out of site of her pursuers, and stumbled onto a small dock that ran parallel to the harbor. A small island with a garden interrupted the dock about ten paces ahead, so she quietly slipped herself into the water and swam toward that shoreline. Through the water, she could see the passing of four feet between the wooden planks. She stopped just short of the island, still hidden by the pier above her, and watched them from afar.

One of the keepers was addressing a maman. "She came right through here. How could you miss her?"

"Oh, I wasn't looking," thi told them with a confident tone, neither defensive nor pleading.

"A woman in fine Heikoan dress? You don't miss someone like that."

"All sorts of people come through here, I don't-"

"This isn't just anyone. She could be a spy. You better not be a sympathizer."

"Honestly, you're pushing me to my limit spouting all these accusations."

"Just tell us where she went and you won't have to deal with me anymore."

She grasped the maman's hair but her partner pulled her away.

"This is going nowhere," he said. He had the tone and demeanor of an overworked keeper: a mumbled voice and swollen hydroderm under his eyes.

"I can't be the only one who saw her come this way," she argued, "And I don't take any of that kanosin shit."

"Maybe you did. Maybe you didn't. Either way, it's a dead end."

He started walking back to the gate while she yelled at his back, "Are you quitting? What if she's that fidelant we've been looking for?"

She sulked in disbelief, staring back at him as the maman she tormented stood behind her, holding hae head in pain. With a sneer, she took off toward the harbor, leaving the maman to go back to hae duties.

"It's clear now," thi said, and Melna paused as if to wonder if thi was talking to her. Slowly, she moved away from the dock and approached the maman with caution.

She saw hae holding hae head. "Hey, are you ok?" she asked, reaching her hand out to the maman's shoulder. Thi looked up at her with a face that had long internalized the folly of trust. But hae mouth still mustered a smile of gratitude.

"It will take them a bit more than some roughing to hurt me," thi said.

Though it was dark, Melna could clearly see the features of hae face. Thi had round cheeks and a small nose, but hae eyes and hair were more clever than any she'd seen before.

"How could they harass you like that?"

"This is Rudjan; strength and money are the law."

"Where I come from, the law is what the community decides."

"And where might that be, darling?"

She glanced around for anyone who might have a keen interest in her origin.

"I am from Heiko," she said quietly.

The maman was a bit confused but said, "Are you afraid someone will hear you? They say your government was keeping secrets, but I don't buy it. What does some extra food buy you but more misery? Better to die quickly."

Melna smiled a bit. "You're the first person I've met that believes in us," she said. "Many even from Heiko are unsure."

"Ah. Fear does bring out the worst in people."

Melna offered hae some water from her canteen and thi accepted it graciously.

"Thank you, darling."

Melna hesitated to introduced herself, but decided it was in her best interest to make at least one ally at this point in her journey.

"I'm Mel-", she rethought her words, "ka. Melka."

"Melka. A wonderful name," said the maman. "I'm Shira, guardian and captain of the Silver Saffa. We're about the depart now, but, I think we have room for one more."

"Actually," she said tactfully, "I am looking for a way back home."

"To Heiko?"

"Yes."

"It's too dangerous," thi said, seeming uncomfortable for the first time.

Melna pleaded to hae, "I would be immensely indebted to you."

"And you will die before you can repay it."

She leaned in close and took hae hands in her own.

"I know the danger that lies ahead. Whatever you think I'm blind to, I assure you I've already learned of it."

"Then why do you insist on going there?"

"To save my people."

Thi looked around haeself, looking for some keeper or spy lying in wait.

"You're asking me to do the impossible," thi said. "The whole peninsula will be blockaded. No one can leave or enter."

"Just take me halfway then. I can make the rest."

"Did you hear what I just said?"

"I can do it."

The air was still and filled with tension.

"I have a plan that you probably won't like, but you don't really have a choice do you?"

"I'm desparate, Shira."

"The only way you're getting back to Heiko is through a Holragi ship. Just do as I say, and this will all work out fine."

Shira took her hand and the two walked cautiously to hae ship, avoiding any keepers that might be hanging around.

<!-- left off -->

"You will learn soon. But for now, it is too dangerous here. We must leave immediately."

"No. This is all too convenient to be coincidence. You tell me why you're helping me and how do you know Linyu?"

Thi sighed and spoke somberly. "I was once a pupil of Linyu's mother, Casra. Thi led a small company back in the early days after the seventh cold. Thi taught me nearly everything I know about how to lead people. Over time, it became clear that the kanosin had taken over and I was forced to take hae place. As chief, I took hae company to new heights and became very wealthy in the process, but I never got to thank hae for all that thi taught me."

Thi laughed softly at haeself. "I guess my gratitude is burning a hole in my heart, and this is my way of paying it."

Melna knew a lie when she saw one. But this one was peppered with truths that she couldn't decipher. She decided to follow this maman to see where thi would lead her, but knew to keep a safe distance.

"Before I go with you," she said, "I need to tend to my saffa. I'll be quick about it. Meet me at the harbor?"

"Melna, we must leave _now_."

"I'll be fine," she said confidently.

"Let me go with you. I know these streets well."

"That won't be necessary. I'll only be a moment."

The maman saw that she wouldn't be convinced so easily. Thi sighed and backed away, realizing how closely thi had leaned in to speak to her.

"My ship is at pier 5," thi said. "We have very little time to save them, Melna. Please be quick."

"I want to save Linyu as much as you do. I won't be long, I promise."

And with a quickness in hae step, the maman faded down the dark alleyway with hae eyes fixed upon Melna. There is no other displeasure quite like being the prey of another's eye. She felt it at Heiko station: How the two looked at her with a hungry gaze, eyeing her bag and her saffa. She felt it in Fajro's presence, his face a thin mask to hide his lustful thoughts. And she knew this wouldn't be the last time.

It was larger than she had imagined, outfitted with two large foldable sails on each side and three pairs of risers for power in a headwind. The forward hull was adorned with brand new plates of steel which set the ship low in the water. But the crew didn't seem to mind it as they played some sort of game on a crate on the dock.

"What are those plates for?" She asked Shinna as she got closer.

"Ice. The ocean is full of it now. We need something to break through the larger chunks so they don't damage the rest of the boat."

"Ice? In the ocean?"

"There's always been an ice line but it is far beyond where most explorers have gone. Ever since the obscura, it's been moving closer as the skywinds from the desert lose their speed and heat."

Melna was in awe at Shinna's depth of knowledge, chocking it up to one of the many things a kelper needs to know to survive in the ocean.

"Crew!", Shinna addressed the crowd of around twenty. The volume of her voice shocked Melna out of her daydream. "This is uh.." Thi leaned toward Melna, trying to remember her name.

"Melna-", she hinted to hae, "Belka!" thi shouted confidently. "This is Belka."

"Oy," They all greeted her. She was too paranoid about her identity to correct Shinna, but also too amused to mind.

"She'll be joining us for a short time on today's voyage."

"You bring us anything?" a maman from the group shouted at her. She flushed red in embarassment, not knowing that she would be expected to bring something.

"We've taken in enough freeloaders, Shinna. When do we start getting a cut for our generosity?"

"That's not how generosity works," thi responded.

A younger woman from the group rebuked hae, "Then what's the point? We all need something to live on."

Melna glanced at an exapserated Shinna, who was looking for answers as much as she was.

Melna offered them a deal. "I... have very little with me. But I can ensure an eternal welcome to all of you amongst the people of Heiko."

"A welcome, eh?" the skeptical woman said. "What sort of promise is that?"

Her mind raced to find an answer, but none came to mind.

"Sounds empty to me," said the maman.

Shinna spoke up, "Enough. You'll barely notice her. She'll be in stowage."

"With the rest of the garbage," said the woman.

Shinna didn't respond but led Melna past the crew. She shared a glance with a man who had been sitting in the back. He didn't recognize her, but she could never forget the face of the man who stormed out of the conduit, and of those blue eyes peering from beneath the satchel. She would maintain her vigilance.

Melna found a clearing to sit in amongst the tarred crates and oiled bags in stowage. The room was dark save for a few round portholes, but she resolved to endure the journey as it would only be for a short time. _A short time_, she repeated to herself to convince her reluctant mind. There were countless muffles of footsteps, shouts, and machinery coming alive above as they began to push off from the dock and toward the rails to Heiko.

Her mind wandered to Kipnu, remembering how fearless he was through his sentencing and even in the stories that Linyu told her about him. And Liffa who she heard from the furthest reaches of the void, still living breath by breath. She clutched her pendant, and imagined they could share some of their courage through it.

Through the porthole, she eyed the bridge over the delta and the faint glimmer of the train rail in the distance. Her mind wandered to Laen, Pomri, Linyu, and it sunk once more into anguish. She had led them to Rudjan, and Rudjan had divided them all. She focused on the listener, once again searching for answers in the static, but it was just static, and she was just alone in the darkness. At least, she believed that she was.

"Who are you?" a quiet voice pierced the silence.

Melna was startled to her feet at the invisible voice. She looked around but saw neither stirring nor looking.

"Who was that?" she asked, still scanning the room.

She saw a satchel rustling in the corner, and from it a pair of light blue eyes emerged staring at her.

"Linyu?" she asked, and the voice let out a gasp, as if knowing the name. Melna realized they were both afraid of saying anything, but she imagined that hiding yourself in a satchel in the dark was a much more vulnerable state of mind, so she went first.

"My name is Melna. I met a kaln named Linyu last evening with eyes quite similar to yours."

"This kaln... also has blue eyes?"

Melna cautiously walked closer to hae while thi crawled out of the hiding bag. Through the darkness, she could see the outline of the maman's unclothed body and the soft rays of Ara landing on her skin. Her wrinkles revealed that thi was severely dehydrated, and Melna immediately withdrew her canteen to give hae a drink. The maman was wary of the strange object Melna was handing hae, but quickly bowed to desparation when thi realized that the object was a canteen, and took it eagerly.

"Are you from Ulukoma," Melna asked.

"I think so?"

"What happened to Kipnu?"

"Kipnu?" thi seemed more confused than before.

Melna apologized, "I'm sorry. He is my jundman, and... I was... Nobody knows what happened to him."

"I have no memories," thi said, beginning to cry, "I only know that I woke up yesterday on this ship, in this satchel, blind and bruised. I met Ramne who was... unhappy when I first met him... And now I've met you."

"Are you injured?" Melna asked, recalling the wound on hae head.

"Yes, I think it's why I don't have any memories. But it doesn't seem infected or anything."

"Here, let me see."

Melna gently pulled hae closer to the light and observed even more bruises and wounds and scars across hae whole body.

"My goodness. How did you get all of these?" Melna asked as she pressed gently on a few healing cuts to see if they had gone numb. Thi winced uneasily at each one.

"I don't know," thi said, "But whoever I was, I don't want to be hae anymore."

Melna smiled and said, "Your body is a vessel for the many lives that may fill and empty through it. Whatever may have filled it before does not affect the beauty that fills it now."

The maman smiled. "That's the best thing anyone has ever said to me," thi said with a cracked voice. "I hope the rest of the world is as gracious as you."

Melna smiled and fought back telling hae the truth.

"Come with me to Heiko," Melna asked.

"What? Why?"

"I think you're in danger."

"But... I've heard there's danger in Heiko as well."

"Yes. Terrible danger, but we can escape and-"

"You can't escape it. The danger is from above."

"Above?-"

"Hope I'm not interrupting anything", called Ramne, opening a door to the stowage deck.

His voice struck fear in the maman's heart, and thi ran back toward the satchel to hide. Melna stood her ground between them.

"You look familiar", he said as he got sight of Melna, "Have I run into you before?"

"If you did, I would have said something."

"Maybe I didn't hear you."

"Maybe you didn't listen."

"You know, you seem an awful lot like a man I used to know. Thought he was above everyone. Above me." he paused to lean on a pillar next to him and look closer at Melna, "Didn't work out so well for him."

She eyed him up and down, and felt a wave of disgust wash over her.

"Why don't you take your stories somewhere else?"

"Ah I see. Why am I even here?" he asked disingenuously. "Well I figured you'd have met my little blue-eyed monster by now, and well, that bothers me a little bit." He moved from the pillar, closer to Melna, and stood facing her eye-to-eye.

"Caus I rather like keeping that thing a secret."

"Thi's a throngia. Just like the rest of us."

He laughed, "Sure thi looks just like one of us. That's because thi used to be."

He reached for the satchel behind Melna, but she pushed him away.

"Heh. Maybe you're one of them too."

"One of who?"

He walked toward her and tried to lift her by the shirt, to which she promptly responded with a punch in the abdomen. But his clothing was thicker than she imagined and it cushioned the impact of her hit. He calmly shrugged it off and threw her to the side, then grabbed the satchel again and lifted the blue-eyed maman out of it by hae hair, holding hae face over Melna's like a puppet.

"Let me tell you a story. A maman named Ginnu used to own this body. But one day thi died because that fucking idiot sent her into the dark alone. Thi fell three stories onto a metal floor, and screamed in pain while he tried to save hae."

Melna could hear Ramne but could only see the maman's anguish through hae face. Thi wasn't dead, thi was alive.

He continued to mock them, "This _thing_ is a demon. An abomination to life! I wish I could kill it, but it _just won't die_!"

Melna stood back up and away from them, and he dropped the maman on the floor sparing no time to do so carefully. She looked around for a weapon, but it was too dark to see. Ramne barreled toward her so she dodged his lunge and made a break for the stairs to the upper deck. But before she could reach the top, a hand grabbed her ankle and pulled her hard onto the step where she landed on her head-
