## Chapter 19

Melna's fervid limbs slipped through the crowds of Rudjani who remained blissfully ignorant and powerless to the greater changes happening around them. It was clear that nothing could stop them from filling the docks of the merchant's quarter. They would sooner go hungry than surrender their sense of normalcy. A feeling of disdain washed over her for their ignorance, but she reminded herself of the law of self-determination. That one's impulse is merely the a result of the world around them, and Melna was partially responsible for that.

She was cautious as she approached the gate. There weren't any signs of a trap, but the quiet and the absence of merchants gave her pause.

She called from the inside, "Fanla...", but there was no response nor sign of anyone. She glanced at a strange wooden object on the ground near the gate and found Fanla's listener, placed gently on the ground, out of the way of passing feet. From the direction of the bridge, the sound of footsteps and a coy man's voice broke the silence. Melna hid in between gates, sitting casually against the wall so as to avoid suspicion, but listening intently to the voices on the other side.

"You're the 'sworn keeper' of the south gate?" he asked.

Bavle responded with a tone of defiance. "My oath is to the land of Rudjan, not to you."

"The land," he scoffed an Melna imagined a smirk, "Let's see if the land can save you in prison."

"Those women weren't hurting anyone, they just wanted to go home."

"That's not for you to decide. Soldiers, you know what to do."

_Neither fear of death nor promise of reward_, Melna recalled Bavle's pride in that declaration and a wave of dread washed over her. The sound of an unsheathing sword punctured the air, followed by two others, and Melna got up to look. Bavle was in a defensive stance with her sword glistening in the reddened Ara light. The way she stood, it was as if she'd fought a thousand battles and practiced ten thousand more.

The man scoffed at her again. "You think you can threaten me with that decorative stick you call a sword? It's duller than that old head of yours."

Bavle smirked. "I could take you down with my bare hands but a stick would be more fun."

The three jumped into their match, and Melna looked for a lever or a rope, hoping there was more than one way to move the gate. She found no switch, but took up a few chunks of brick that had broken off from the wall and waited for an opening. Bavle was unfettered by the soldiers' advances, dodging each of their attacks with a swift and steady bend of her body. It was apparent that her age had no bearing on her acuity.

The strange man looking on was becoming impatient. He reached for something in his breastpocket but before he had a firm grip, a rock struck his knee and caused him to yell in pain. The soldiers were distracted by the commotion, and Bavle took the opportunity to land quick slashing blows to their inner legs, sending them to the ground. But before she could move to her last target, an explosion erupted from his hand and she felt a disturbance in the air near her face. She turned and ran as quickly as she could as he pointed a strange metal pipe at her. Melna threw another rock and knocked the pipe clean from his hand and into the water below.

"Keepers, get that woman!" he cried, and suddenly two people ran from a kelping ship toward Melna. Without hesitation, she ran swiftly away from them toward the harbor. She was keenly aware of how little time she had: the entire city was becoming an elaborate trap and like a fish caught in a net, it was only a matter of time.

She scaled the gates and walls with her eyes, looking for openings and niches to hide in, but the wall was built flat in every way, and dutifully maintained over countless generations. Even the streams to and from the wetlands outside traveled a torturous path of steel bars spanning the thickness of the wall.

_A ship will have to do_, she thought.

She rounded a corner of the wall, temporarily putting her out of site of her pursuers, and stumbled onto a small dock that ran parallel to the harbor. A small island with a garden interrupted the dock about ten paces ahead, so she quietly slipped herself into the water and swam toward that shoreline. Through the water, she could see the passing of four feet between the wooden planks. She stopped just short of the island, still hidden by the pier above her, and watched them from afar.

One had the demeanor of a hard-worker, the portrait of a man whose zealotry for the ideals of justice kept him trapped in his job. He had an angry mumbling tone to match as he addressed a maman who stood in the garden.

"Speak, maman! Where did she go?"

"Who?"

He was held back by his calmer partner, a taller woman of cleaner look and sharper thought.

"She came right through here. You couldn't have missed her."

"I wasn't looking," thi told them with a confident tone, neither defensive nor pleading.

"She's a woman in fine Heikoan dress. You don't miss someone like that."

"All sorts of people come through here, I wouldn't have-"

The man. "This isn't just anyone. She could be a spy. You better not be a sympathizer!"

He charged in and grasped the maman's hair, but the other pulled him away.

"Just tell us where she went," she said, "and you won't have to deal with us anymore."

The maman sighed as if annoyed by these petulant children bothering hae. "Perhaps you'd like to bring these baseless accusations to the Clerk of Trade? Surely he'd help you more than I."

The keeper paused and measured the weight of hae challenge.

"This is going nowhere," said the impatient keeper. "I can't be the only one who saw her come this way. And I don't take any of that kanosin shit."

"Maybe you did. Maybe you didn't," she said. "Either way, it's a dead end."

She started walking back to the gate while her partner yelled at her, "Are you quitting? What if she's that fidelant we've been looking for?"

He sulked in disbelief, as the maman he tormented stood behind him, holding hae head in pain. With a sneer, he took off toward the harbor, leaving the maman to the garden.

"It's clear now," thi said to the air, and Melna paused as if to wonder if thi was talking to her. Slowly, she moved away from the dock and approached the maman with caution.

She saw hae holding hae head. "Hey, are you ok?" she asked, reaching her hand out to the maman's shoulder. Thi looked up at her with a face that had long internalized the folly of trust. But hae mouth still mustered a smile of gratitude.

"It will take them a bit more than some roughing to hurt me," thi said.

Though it was dark, Melna could clearly see the features of hae face. Thi had round cheeks and a small nose, but hae eyes and hair were more clever than any she'd seen before.

"How could they harass you like that?"

"This is Rudjan; strength and money are the law."

"Where I come from, the law is decided and enforced by the community."

"And where might that be, darling?"

She glanced around for anyone who might have a keen interest in her origin.

"I am from Heiko," she said quietly.

The maman was a bit confused but said, "Are you afraid the keepers will hear you? They're gone now."

"Yes, but... there are always more."

"This little garden island has no place to hide but the very place you found. Nobody would give this place a second thuoght."

Melna felt a little safer with hae, but kept a conscious eye on the docks for anything lurking in the shadows.

"They told us your government was hoarding grain," thi said, "but I don't buy it. What would a little bit of extra food buy you? You're still going to die."

Melna did not admire hae cynicism, but appreciated it nonetheless. "You're the first person I've met that believes in us," she said. "Many even from Heiko are unsure."

"Fear leads to foolish thoughts and desparate decisions."

Melna offered hae some water from her canteen and thi accepted it graciously.

"Thank you, darling."

Melna hesitated to introduced herself, but decided it was in her best interest to make at least one ally at this point in her journey.

"I'm Mel-", she rethought her words, "ka. Melka."

"Me'ka. A wonderful name," said the maman. "I'm Shimba, guardian and captain of the Silver Saffa. We're about the depart to Yansha, but, I think we have room for one more."

"Actually," she said graciously, "I _am_ looking for a way back home."

"To Heiko?"

"Yes."

"But we're going to Yansha."

"I understand, but I hoped that you might take a desparate fidelant to Heiko on the way."

"No. It's too dangerous," thi said, seeming uncomfortable for the first time. Melna figured that thi didn't want to let on what she already knew.

"I know the danger that lies ahead. Whatever you think I'm blind to, I assure you, I know."

"Then why do you insist on going back?"

"To save my people." She kneeled close and took hae hands in her own, pleading to hae for help. "I would be immensely indebted to you."

"And you will die before you can repay it."

"I assure you, I canâ€“"

But the maman shushed her and looked around for some keeper or spy lying in wait.

"You're asking me to do something impossible," thi said. "The whole peninsula will be blockaded. No one can leave or enter."

"Blockaded?" Melna was incredulous. This was no longer just a simple evacuation. "Just take me halfway then. I can make up the rest on foot."

"Do you understand what a blockade is? A wall of soldiers and ships stands between you and your people, and they would love nothing more than to turn your death into a show of force."

The air was still and filled with tension.

Shimba said, "I have a better idea but you probably won't like it."

"I'm desparate, Shimba."

"Don't go to Heiko. Go to Shaki and use your conduit there to speak to Heiko."

  <!-- The only way you're getting back to Heiko is through a Holragi ship." -->

<!-- "That would be suicide. The Holragi would never let me off their ship." -->

<!-- "Look, I'm just telling you what I know. If this is really what you want to do, I can get you to the ship, but the rest will be up to you." -->

Melna looked through her mind at all of the imaginings of her own end, and, for just a moment, thought of her own self-preservation over the safety of her people. Perhaps someone in the Heiko intelligence network knew of the blockade. Perhaps Pomri and Linyu and Fanla would make it to Heiko in time to prepare everyone. Or perhaps not. The thought made her sick.

<!-- left of -->

She took Shimba's hand and hae face showed that thi too understood how important this was. Without a word, the two walked cautiously toward the harbor piers, looking around every corner for any keepers that might be lurking about. Melna felt a peculiar sense of dread and worry with each step, as if she'd left something between them unspoken. "Shimba," Melna began, "I hope you don't mind me asking, but why are you helping me? A Rudjani merchant always negotiates, but you haven't."

Thi looked at her with surprise and an expression of earnest importance.

"My time has come and passed. Peoples' lives have passed through my ledger, and let's just say not all of them were in the righteous light of Ara."

Hae eyes were narrowed into a scowl as if remembering something painful.

"Call it atonement, if you will. A rebellious atonement."

Melna usually knew a truth from a lie, but this one she couldn't decipher.

"Well, shall we?" asked Shimba.

It was larger than she had imagined, outfitted with four large foldable sails, two to a side, and three pairs of risers for power in a headwind. The forward hull was adorned with brand new plates of steel which set the ship low in the water. But the crew didn't seem bothered by the clearly worrisome display as they played some sort of game on a crate on the dock.

"What are those plates for?" She asked Shimba as she got closer.

"Ice. The ocean is full of it now. We need something to break through the larger chunks so they don't damage the rest of the boat."

"Ice? In the ocean?"

"There's always been an ice line but it is far beyond where most explorers have gone. Ever since the obscura, it's been moving closer as the skywinds from the desert lose their speed and heat."

Melna was in awe at Shimba's depth of knowledge, chocking it up to one of the many things a kelper needs to know to survive in the ocean.

"Crew!", Shimba addressed the crowd of around twenty. The volume of hae voice shocked Melna out of her daydream. "This is uh.." Thi leaned toward Melna, trying to remember her name.

"Melka-", she hinted to hae, "Be'ka!" thi shouted confidently. "This is Be'ka."

"Oy," They all greeted her. She was too paranoid about her identity to correct Shimba, but also too amused to mind.

"She'll be joining us for a trip to Heiko before Yansha."

"Heiko?" A maman approached the two, doing a once over of Melna with a disgusted look before thi ignored her and addressed Shimba. Thi spoke under hae breath but Melna could still hear hae.

"Have you gone mad?" thi asked. Melna thought that her cover might have been blown, but Shimba remained unfazed, unwavering.

"We'll be fine, Panna. We will take her as far as the blockade, and then be on our way."

Thi made a strange sound with hae teeth, then looked back at Melna.

"You bring us anything?" thi demanded. Melna's cheeks flushed in embarassment, not knowing that she would be expected to bring something.

"Didn't think so. People like you get everything handed to you. Our generosity doesn't come for free."

"That's not how generosity works," Shimba said.

"Then what's the point?" Panna turned back to Shimba. "We all need something to live on."

Melna saw the exapserated look on both of their faces, searched for some answer to quell their needs.

She offered them a deal. "I... have very little with me. But I can ensure an eternal welcome to all of you amongst the people of Heiko."

"A welcome, eh?" said Panna. "That supposed to impress me?"

Her mind raced to find an answer, but none came to mind.

"Empty. See? This Heikoi brings nothing but problems."

Shimba spoke up, "Enough. You'll barely notice her. She'll be in stowage the whole time."

"With the rest of the garbage," said Panna. Thi walked away in silent concession.

Melna followed Shimba past the crew, felt the glare of judgment from every person there, and knew that this was no safe place. She would maintain her vigilance.

Melna found a clearing amongst the tarred crates and oiled bags in the stowage area below deck. The room was dark save for a few round glass windows, but Shimba had promised there was a lantern somewhere, that she only had to look. _A short time_, she repeated to herself to convince her reluctant mind.

Through the muffle of a wooden celing came the sound of innumerable footsteps; of people shouting, and machinery clanking; the hidden psyche of a team coming alive as they began to push off from the dock. They cleared the harbor and a subtle scraping sound filled the air outside as the engine below her whirred alive, vibrating the whole ship with its starting. They were on the path toward Heiko.

Melna's mind wandered to Kipnu, remembering how fearless he was through his sentencing and even in the stories that Linyu told her about him. And Liffa who she had heard from the furthest reaches of the void, still living breath by breath. She removed Fanla's listener from her satchel and lifted it onto her ear, once again searching for some sign of Liffa, but there was nothing but static. Her fingers moved to her pendant instead, and imagined some otherworldly strength hidden inside that could be conjured from its curves and niches.

She moved to a window and eyed the bridge over the wetland delta, still proudly stretching across the wetland as the idle train rail rested in the distance. Her mind wandered to Fanla and her soothing voice, to Pomri and Linyu and Laen, and she sunk once more into anguish. She had led them to Rudjan, and Rudjan had divided them all. And now she was alone in the darkness. At least, she believed that she was.

"Who are you?" a quiet voice pierced the silence.

Melna was startled to her feet at the invisible voice. She looked around but saw neither stirring nor looking.

"Who was that?" she asked, still scanning the room.

She saw a satchel rustling in the corner, and from it a pair of light blue eyes emerged staring at her.

"Linyu?" she asked, and the voice let out a gasp, as if knowing the name. Melna realized they were both afraid of saying anything, but she imagined that hiding yourself in a satchel in the dark was a much more vulnerable state of mind, so she went first.

"My name is Melna. I met a kaln named Linyu last evening with eyes quite similar to yours."

"This kaln... also has blue eyes?"

Melna cautiously walked closer to hae while thi crawled out of the hiding bag. Through the darkness, she could see the outline of the maman's unclothed body and the soft rays of Ara landing on her skin. Her wrinkles revealed that thi was severely dehydrated, and Melna immediately withdrew her canteen to give hae a drink. The maman was wary of the strange object Melna was handing hae, but quickly bowed to desparation when thi realized that the object was a canteen, and took it eagerly.

"Are you from Ulukoma," Melna asked.

"I think so?"

"What happened to Kipnu?"

"Kipnu?" thi seemed more confused than before.

Melna apologized, "I'm sorry. He is my jundman, and... I was... Nobody knows what happened to him."

"I have no memories," thi said, beginning to cry, "I only know that I woke up yesterday on this ship, in this satchel, blind and bruised. I met Ramne who was... unhappy when I first met him... And now I've met you."

"Are you injured?" Melna asked, recalling the wound on hae head.

"Yes, I think it's why I don't have any memories. But it doesn't seem infected or anything."

"Here, let me see."

Melna gently pulled hae closer to the light and observed even more bruises and wounds and scars across hae whole body.

"My goodness. How did you get all of these?" Melna asked as she pressed gently on a few healing cuts to see if they had gone numb. Thi winced uneasily at each one.

"I don't know," thi said, "But whoever I was, I don't want to be hae anymore."

Melna smiled and said, "Your body is a vessel for the many lives that may fill and empty through it. Whatever may have filled it before does not affect the beauty that fills it now."

The maman smiled. "That's the best thing anyone has ever said to me," thi said with a cracked voice. "I hope the rest of the world is as gracious as you."

Melna smiled and fought back telling hae the truth.

"Come with me to Heiko," Melna asked.

"What? Why?"

"I think you're in danger."

"But... I've heard there's danger in Heiko as well."

"Yes. Terrible danger, but we can escape and-"

"You can't escape it. The danger is from above."

"Above?-"

"Hope I'm not interrupting anything", called Ramne, opening a door to the stowage deck.

His voice struck fear in the maman's heart, and thi ran back toward the satchel to hide. Melna stood her ground between them.

"You look familiar", he said as he got sight of Melna, "Have I run into you before?"

"If you did, I would have said something."

"Maybe I didn't hear you."

"Maybe you didn't listen."

"You know, you seem an awful lot like a man I used to know. Thought he was above everyone. Above me." he paused to lean on a pillar next to him and look closer at Melna, "Didn't work out so well for him."

She eyed him up and down, and felt a wave of disgust wash over her.

"Why don't you take your stories somewhere else?"

"Ah I see. Why am I even here?" he asked disingenuously. "Well I figured you'd have met my little blue-eyed monster by now, and well, that bothers me a little bit." He moved from the pillar, closer to Melna, and stood facing her eye-to-eye.

"Caus I rather like keeping that thing a secret."

"Thi's a throngia. Just like the rest of us."

He laughed, "Sure thi looks just like one of us. That's because thi used to be."

He reached for the satchel behind Melna, but she pushed him away.

"Heh. Maybe you're one of them too."

"One of who?"

He walked toward her and tried to lift her by the shirt, to which she promptly responded with a punch in the abdomen. But his clothing was thicker than she imagined and it cushioned the impact of her hit. He calmly shrugged it off and threw her to the side, then grabbed the satchel again and lifted the blue-eyed maman out of it by hae hair, holding hae face over Melna's like a puppet.

"Let me tell you a story. A maman named Ginnu used to own this body. But one day thi died because that fucking idiot sent her into the dark alone. Thi fell three stories onto a metal floor, and screamed in pain while he tried to save hae."

Melna could hear Ramne but could only see the maman's anguish through hae face. Thi wasn't dead, thi was alive.

He continued to mock them, "This _thing_ is a demon. An abomination to life! I wish I could kill it, but it _just won't die_!"

Melna stood back up and away from them, and he dropped the maman on the floor sparing no time to do so carefully. She looked around for a weapon, but it was too dark to see. Ramne barreled toward her so she dodged his lunge and made a break for the stairs to the upper deck. But before she could reach the top, a hand grabbed her ankle and pulled her hard onto the step where she landed on her head-
