## Chapter 19

  "Woop?" cried Laen from the left-most gate.

  "Laen-Laen!" Melna responded with joy. She hurried over to him and asked, "Are you ok? Do you know where Bavle is?"

  He appeared in a good state but shook his head in denial and worry for Bavle. Melna comforted him with a gentle scratch on his forehead.

  "It's ok. She's strong," she said. "I need to get out. Let me find a way."

  She scaled the gates and walls with her eyes, looking for footholds and niches to climb, but all the stones had been eroded to smooth nodules over countless sa'tova, impossible to climb. The wall continued into a stream, adorning a mask of moss and lichen but just as unclimbable. She squinted along the wall into the distance, searching for an opening, but the line gave to none but the fishing harbor. *Perhaps a boat.*

  "Laen. Listen carefully," she said slowly to him. Laen let out a worried "woo" and listened intently through the gate.

  "Our home is in trouble, and it's dangerous to be there. I need you to go home and warn everyone."

  "Woop?" he said, confusedly.

  "Get everyone out of the city and into boats. We have to row into the darkness. It's our only chance."

  "Woop woop," he said confidently and Melna knew that he understood.

  "Now go!"

  With a pat on the neck and a few preparation stretches he took off along the bridge back toward Heiko.

  "Good luck, Laen. I'll be with you soon."

  She turned around and began to walk as quickly as she could toward the harbor.

  She stopped just short at the first sign of three rudjan officials, and blended in behind a porter waiting for hae merchant with far too many boxes. The officials were customs inspectors by look, patrolling the island that connected the markets to the fishers' quarter. *Usually they stay in the port*.

  One of them was taking her frustration out on an older maman. 
  
  "They came right through here. How could you miss them?" She said.
  
  "I honestly wasn't looking."

  "A pair of glowing eyes and wounds all over hae body. You don't miss someone like that."

  "All kinds of people come through here, I don't-"

  "This isn't just anyone. Thi could be working with the obscura. You better not be a sympathizer."

  "N-no. I-"

  "Then tell me where they went!"
  
  She grasped the maman's hair but her partner pulled her away. 
  
  "This is going nowhere," he said, trying to talk calm her down.

  "I can't be the only one who saw it," she argued, "And I don't take any of that kanosin shit."

  "Maybe you did, but you've been searching all day with no leads. It's a dead end."

  He and the other partner turned and started walking toward the customs house while she yelled at their backs, "So we just quit? What if she's one of them?"

  She sulked in disbelief, staring back at them as the maman she tormented lay knealing before her, holding hae head in pain. With a sneer, she took off toward the harbor, perhaps to "search" for more clues. 
  
  After the inspectors left, Melna approached the poor maman while the porter gave nary a glance.

  "Hey, are you ok?" She asked, reaching her hand out to the maman. Thi looked up at her with uncertain eyes, but a smile of gratitude.

  "I'll be fine. I'm just a bit shaken."

  "What were they on about back there?" she asked.

  "'Spector thinks she saw a ghost," thi said as if it were a perfectly normal thing.

  "And they harassed a stranger about it?"

  "This is Rudjan; strength is the law. That and money."

  "Where I come from, the people are the law."

  "And where might that be, darling?"

  "I'm from Heiko."

  "Oh I know Heiko. I go there to sell kelp and restock on our outgoing voyages. They say your government was keeping secrets, but I don't buy it. What does another few days in the dark buy you but more misery? Better to die quickly."

  Melna smiled a bit. "You're the first person I've met that believes we are innocent," she said. "Many even from Heiko are unsure."

  "Ah. Fear does bring out the worst in people."

  Thi finally was able to stand up with Melna help.

  "Thank you, darling."

  She hesitated and introduced herself, "Mel-", she rethought her words, "ka. Melka."

  "Melka. A beautiful name. I'm Shinna," thi told her proudly, "My ship is at the northernmost dock. We're about to go on a voyage, but come find me if you're ever looking for a fresh catch."

  "Great to meet you, Shinna. Actually, I am looking to get back home."

  "Oh. I am no smuggler, but perhaps..." thi smiled, and then it sank as she stared off into the sky.

  "No. It's too dangerous," she said hurriedly.

  She pleaded to hae, "I would be immensely indebted to you."

  "And your life would be a debt that I could never repay to you."

  She leaned in close and took hae hands in her own.

  "If this is about Holragi, then I know what I'm getting into."

  "Why, then, do you insist on going home?"

  "To save my people."

  "It's impossible. They're blockading the peninsula by land and sea. No one can leave or enter.

  "Just take me halfway then. I can make the rest."

  "You will die."

  "As opposed to a few more days in the dark?"

  The air contemplated its silence.

  "I charge extra for you fancy folk you know." Thi nodded to Melna's senate robes that were visible from a crack in her bag. They shared a smirk and Shinna took her hand to lead her to hae ship.

  It was larger than she had imagined, outfitted with two large foldable sails on each side and three pairs of risers for power in a headwind. The forward hull was adorned with brand new plates of steel which set the ship low in the water. But the crew didn't seem to mind it as they played some sort of game on a crate on the dock.

  "What are those plates for?" She asked Shinna as she got closer.

  "Ice. The ocean is full of it now. We need something to break through the larger chunks so they don't damage the rest of the boat."

  "Ice? In the ocean?"

  "There's always been an ice line but it is far beyond where most explorers have gone. Ever since the obscura, it's been moving closer as the skywinds from the desert lose their speed and heat."

  Melna was in awe at Shinna's depth of knowledge, chocking it up to one of the many things a kelper needs to know to survive in the ocean.

  "Crew!", Shinna addressed the crowd of around twenty. The volume of her voice shocked Melna out of her daydream. "This is uh.." Thi leaned toward Melna, trying to remember her name.

  "Mel-", she hinted to hae, "-ba!" thi shouted confidently. "This is Melba."

  "Melba!" They all welcomed her. She was too paranoid about her identity to correct them, but also too amused to mind.
  
  "She'll be joining us for a short time on today's voyage."

  "You bring us anything?" a maman from the group shouted at her. She flushed red in embarassment, not knowing that she had to bring something.

  "We've taken in enough freeloaders, Shinna. When do we start getting a cut for our generosity?"

  "That's not how generosity works."

  A younger woman from the group rebuked hae, "Then what's the point? We all need something."

  Melna glanced at an exapserated Shinna, who was looking for answers as much as she was. She decided to speak.
  
  "I... have very little with me," she told the group. "But I can ensure an eternal welcome to you all amongst the people of Heiko."

  "A welcome, eh?" the skeptical woman said. "What sort of promise is that?"

  Her mind raced to find an answer, but none came to mind.

  "Sounds empty to me," said the maman.

  Shinna spoke up, "Enough. You'll barely notice her onboard. She'll be in stowage."

  "With the rest of the garbage," said the woman.

  Shinna didn't respond but led Melna past the crew. She shared a glance with a man who had been sitting in the back. He didn't recognize her, but she could never forget the face of the man who stormed out of the conduit, and of those blue eyes peering from beneath the satchel. She was no longer safe.

*************

  Melna was given a space amongst the tarred crates in stowage. It was dimly lit by a few round windows, but she resolved to endure as it would only be for a short time. *A short time*, she repeated to herself to convince her reluctant mind. There were countless muffles of footsteps, shouts, and machinery coming alive above as they began to push off from the dock and toward the rails to Heiko. 

  Through the window, she eyed the bridge over the delta and the faint glimmer of the train rail in the distance. Her mind wandered to Laen, Pomri, Linyu, and it sunk once more into anguish. She had led them to Rudjan, and Rudjan had divided them all. She focused on the listener, once again searching for answers in the static, but it was just static, and she was just alone in the darkness.

  "Who are you?"
  
  Melna was startled to her feet at the invisible voice. She looked around but saw neither stirring nor looking.

  "Who was that?" she asked, still scanning the room.

  She saw a satchel rustling in the corner, and from it a pair of light blue eyes emerged staring at her.

  "Linyu?" she asked, but the voice hesitated.

  Melna realized they were both afraid of saying anything, but suddenly remembered the name that the mysterious man called her, "Ginnu."

  "How do you know me?" she asked defensively.

  "My name is Melna. I met a kaln named Linyu last evening. Thi mentioned someone named Ginnu with the same blue eyes that you have," she lied.

  "This kaln... has these eyes too?"

  Melna cautiously walked closer to the Ginnu while she crawled out of it. Through the darkness, she could see the outline of Ginnu's unclothed body and the soft rays of Ara landing on her skin. The wrinkles of her skin revealed that she was severely dehydrated, and Melna immediately withdrew her canteen to give her a drink. Ginnu was doubtful at the strange object Melna was handing her, but quickly bowed to desparation when she realized that the object was a canteen, and she took it eagerly.

  "Are you from Ulukoma," Melna asked.
  
  "Yes. Where are y-"

  "What happened to Kipnu?"

  Ginnu seemed confused.

  Melna apologized, "I'm sorry. We are joined, and... I just. Nobody knows what happened to him."

  "I have no memories," she said, beginning to cry, "I only know that I am Ginnu and I woke up yesterday on this ship, in this satchel, naked and blind. I only know Ramne, and now you."

  *Ramne. That must be his name.*

  "Are you injured?" Melna asked, recalling the wound on her head that she saw before.

  "Yes, I think it's why I don't have any memories. But it doesn't seem infected or anything."

  "Here, let me see."
  
  Melna gently pulled her closer to the light and observed even more bruises and wounds and scars across her whole body.

  "My goodness. How did you get all of these before?" Melna asked as she pressed gently on a few smaller bruises she saw, to see if Ginnu could feel them. She winced uneasily at each one.

  "I don't know," she said, "But whoever I was, I don't want to be her anymore."

  Melna smiled and said, "I'm glad," but silently she knew that she and Ramne must have been in an abusive relationship. She had to get her away from him.
  
  "Come with me to Heiko," Melna asked.

  "What? Why?"

  "I think you're in danger."

  "But... there's danger in Heiko."

  "Yes. Terrible danger, but we can escape and-"

  "You can't escape it. The danger is above."

  "Above?-"

  "Hope I'm not interrupting anything", called Ramne, opening a door to the stowage deck.
  
  His voice struck fear in Ginnu's heart, and she ran back toward the satchel to hide. Melna stood her ground in front of Ginnu.

  "You look familiar", he said as he got sight of Melna, "Have I run into you before?"

  "If you did, I would have said something."

  "Maybe I didn't hear you."

  "Maybe you didn't listen."

  "You know, you seem an awful lot like a man I used to know. He wasn't very good at listening either. I think," he paused to lean on a pillar next to him, "it's just our nature not to listen."

  She eyed him up and down, and felt a wave of disgust wash over her.

  "Would it pain you to leave a woman alone?"

  "Well I figured you'd have met my blue-eyed monster by now, and that just bothers me, you know?" He moved from the pillar, closer to Melna, and stood facing her eye-to-eye.

  "Caus I rather like keeping that thing a secret."

  "She's a throngia. Just like the rest of us."

  He laughed, "Oh ok. So you don't know what she really is. I guess I came down here for nothing then."

  He reached for the satchel behind Melna, but she dodged and punched him in the abdomen, which he calmly shrugged off and threw her to the ground. He looked at the satchel again and lifted Ginnu out of it by the hair, holding her face over Melna's like a puppet.

  "I'll let you in on a little secret. This is the face of someone who died. A whole day, no breathing. She bled out after braining herself on a metal floor."

  Melna could hear Ramne but could only see Ginnu's anguish through her face. She wasn't dead, she was alive.

  He continued to mock them, "This is an affront to life. An abomination! And it deserves to die!"

  She stood back up and away from Ginnu, and he dropped Ginnu on the floor while she began to cry. It became apparent to Melna that all of Ginnu's wounds were likely attempts to murder her, and it sickened her even more. She looked around for a weapon, but it was too dark to see. Kipnu barreled toward her but she dodged his lunge and made a break for the stairs to the upper deck.

  "Shinna!!" She yelled while looking all over for hae. She spotted a crowd of people at the bow and Shinna facing them, hae feet on the gunwale. She sprinted toward hae, but before she could reach hae, thi screamed something unintelligible and was pushed into the sea by the grouped in front of her.


  



  <!-- Ramne tries to kill Melna, but Ginnu kills him instead, and he kills her in the process. -->

  "Ramne. Who is Ramne?"

  "I've heard of him," Pomri chimed in. "He used to be some nobody in the Rudjan guard who thought he was smarter than the rest of us. Never got promoted, so he just left us one day without a trace."


  Linyu whimpered in fear at his name, drawing Pomri's attention.

  "Eh? What's gotten into you?" she asked.

  Thi was getting ready to jump off of Laen-Laen and run, but Melna had already become aware of hae and leapt back to hae.

  "Hey, Linyu. What's wrong?" asked Melna, holding onto hae arms.

  "Ramne," thi said in a cracked voice, "He..."

  Tears were forming at the corners of hae eyes.

  "What did he do?"

  "Mom," thi said, at the end of hae wit.




  "I take it you're not a boat person. Well, we can't go back now so you're either coming with us or you're on your own again."

  Thi took a moment, feeling angry at the predicament thi was put into. There was nowhere to run, standing outside a massive city barred from entry, and Laen-Laen, who could take hae anywhere if anywhere were safe anymore. Thi placed hae hand on Kip's pendant under hae shirt and closed hae eyes in thought.

  "Together," thi whispered. Pomri smiled at hae courage.



"The train here is shut down too," Pomri said with disappointment.

"Nevermind that I need to speak with Linyu," said Melna.

"What's gotten into you?" Pomri asked, suspicious.

Melna stooped to Linyu's level and gazed into hae firey blue eyes. She was sure that the woman had them too.

"Do you know a woman named Ginnu and a possibly her partner?" she asked.

Linyu was shocked, "H-How.."

"I need to know, Linyu. Please tell me. Who are they?"

"Kanosin"

"They sell kanosin?"

Thi nodded in confirmation.

"Did you know they are looking for you?"

Hae hands began to tremble and she grasped them in comfort.

"Why are they after you?"

Thi pointed to the listener in hae ear.

"Why is this thing so important? What does it do?"

Thi began to cry but held hae wits together while trying to find a way to explain.

Melna pressed for simpler answers.

"is it a weapon, some new material?"

Thi took the listener off hae ear and gave it to Melna, who hesitantly put it up to her ear.

"I can hear strange static sounds. Where is it coming from?"

Linyu gestured all around, wishing thi had hae transmitter there.

Pomri interjected, "You're wasting your time with this nonsense."

"Wait. I can hear someone talking," she said, still listening intently. She tried to hear the words, but could only hear a few through the noise.

"What are they talking about?" she asked Linyu again.

But instead of an answer Linyu held hae hand up to hae ear, telling her to keep listening.

She listened closer and then heard an unmistakeable voice of the maman who woke up early to sit under a tree. Who dressed her before she went to Shaki and gave her a kiss on the forehead even when thi was unhappy with her.

"Liffa! You're alive!"



  "Please," Melna sniffled and looked down. "Keep mine with you as well. I do not know what fate lies before me, only that it will be dark and obscured from me. It would bring me peace to know that him and I are together in some small way, living apart from ."

  She pressed it tightly against hae chest, taking time to cherish the memories of the man and maman she loved and to remember the oath of protection which she was desparately trying to keep. Her hands lifted the pendant from her neck and place it over Melna's.
