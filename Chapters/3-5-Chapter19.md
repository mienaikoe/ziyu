## Chapter 19

<!--
- Holragi wants to use Melna and Liffa as bargaining chips against each other when negotiating with Liffa about communicating with the obscura.
  - If Heiko is blockaded, there needs to be some external force to help them
    - Ulukoma?
      - Setre knows about Holragi's plan to destroy Heiko
      - They would have to plan to help Heiko already.
        - That's what planting Linyu was about
        - Why would they help Heiko?
          - Gain legitimacy in the senate
          - Avenge Kipnu's death
      - Melna and a small army would have to play decoy to try to buy time for Heiko.
        - Gets captured by Holragi's blockade. They kill her army.
      - A blockade by both Holragi and Rudjan would be massive.
        - Part 4:
        - They would have to sneak out secretly. How?
          - Kanosin+Antikan = no breathing for a long time. Swim out in the darkness to a ship only visible underwater (kanosin blue)
            - How does Heiko acquire Kanosin+Antikan?
              - Casra's stash in Shaki Harbor. Linyu+Setre fetch it
                - then arrive in Heiko (during a blockade?!)
                - then smuggle it into Heiko, taking on a disguise.
      - They don't have a navy. But they do have a fearless fighting force.
      - Setre could steal a boat from Rudjan with Linyu's help (going back to what she does best for the greater good)


- infighting as Linyu despises Setre for using Melna as a diversion to save Heiko

- Melna hides
  - Overhears talk about capturing Pomri
    - They didn't find Linyu, but Linyu can't see without antikan

- Pomri has been tricked into taking a train to Shaki
  - This sets up a sacrifice story where Melna has to trade her own life

- Linyu (and Pomri as an alternative) hid from Shaki soldiers and magistrates that had arrived at the train station looking for them. Thi hid for a long time and was guided by Setre+transmitter to a ship.
  - This brings Linyu closer to Antikan, which lets hae see.
  - Linyu can transmit information to Melna now.
    - Linyu can use numbers on their pendants to encrypt messages.
    - Linyu can route Heikoans to Ulukoma
      - If Linyu uncovers that they're now immortal

- Linyu/Pomri encounter Setre who fills them in about Ulukoma
  - and the invulnerability of Kanosin
    - They would still want to go to Shaki to tell the world about Holragi's betrayal.

  "Woop?" cried Laen from the left-most gate.

  "Laen-Laen!" Melna responded with joy. She hurried over to him and asked, "Are you ok? Do you know where Bavle is?"

  He appeared in a good state but shook his head in denial and worry for Bavle. Melna comforted him with a gentle scratch on his forehead.

  "It's ok. She's strong," she said. "I need to get out. Let me find a way."

  She scaled the gates and walls with her eyes, looking for footholds and niches to climb, but all the stones had been eroded to smooth nodules over countless sa'tova, impossible to climb. The wall continued into a stream, adorning a mask of moss and lichen but just as unclimbable. She squinted along the wall into the distance, searching for an opening, but the line gave to none but the fishing harbor. *Perhaps a boat.*

  "Laen. I'll be right back," she said hurriedly. Laen let out a worried "woo" and watched through the gate as she ran Ulu-ward.

  She stopped just short of the harbor at the first sign of three rudjan officials, and blended in behind a porter waiting for hae merchant with far too many boxes. The officials were customs inspectors by look, patrolling the island that connected the markets to the fishers' quarter. *Usually they stay in the port*.

  One of them was taking her frustration out on an older maman. 
  
  "They came right through here. How could you miss them?" She said.
  
  "I honestly wasn't looking."

  "A pair of glowing eyes and wounds all over hae body. You don't miss someone like that."

  "All kinds of people come through here, I don't-"

  "This isn't just anyone. Thi could be working with the obscura. You better not be a sympathizer."

  "N-no. I-"

  "Then tell me where they went!"
  
  She grasped the maman's hair but her partner pulled her away. 
  
  "This is going nowhere," he said, trying to talk calm her down.

  "I can't be the only one who saw it," she argued, "And I don't take any of that kanosin shit."

  "Maybe you did, but you've been searching all day with no leads. It's a dead end."

  He and the other partner turned and started walking toward the customs house while she yelled at their backs, "So we just quit? What if she's one of them?"

  She sulked in disbelief, staring back at them as the maman she tormented lay knealing before her, holding hae head in pain. With a sneer, she took off toward the harbor, perhaps to "search" for more clues. 
  
  After the inspectors left, Melna approached the poor maman while the porter gave nary a glance.

  "Hey, are you ok?" She asked, reaching her hand out to the maman. Thi looked up at her with uncertain eyes, but a smile of gratitude.

  "I'll be fine. I'm just a bit shaken."

  "What were they on about back there?" she asked.

  "'Spector thinks she saw a ghost," thi said as if it were a perfectly normal thing.

  "And they harassed a stranger about it?"

  "This is Rudjan; strength is the law. That and money."

  "Where I'm from, people are the law."

  "And where might that be, darling?"

  "I'm from Heiko."

  "Oh I know Heiko. They said your government was keeping secrets, but I don't buy it. What does another few days in the dark buy you? More nuzzles with your loved ones? Far better to die quickly, I say."

  Melna smiled a bit. "You're the first person I've met that believes we are innocent," she said. "Many even from Heiko are unsure."

  "Fear does bring out the worst in people. It's only natural."

  Thi finally was able to stand up with Melna holding hae hand.

  "Thank you... um?"

  "Mel-", she rethought her words, "ka. Melka."

  "Melka. A beautiful name. I'm Shinna," thi told her proudly, "I run a fishing outfit in the fishers' quarter so if you're ever looking for a fresh catch, let me know."

  "Great to meet you, Shinna. Actually, I am looking to get across the wall, back to my home."

  "Oh. I see. Well, smuggling isn't exactly my field of expertise, but I could make an exception."

  "I would be immensely indebted to you."

  "Damn right you would be. I charge extra for you fancy folk." Thi nodded to Melna's listener, which she had forgotten she was still wearing. They shared a smirk and Shinna took her hand to lead her to hae boat.

  The boat was bigger than she had imagined, equipped with one large sail and two very high rail contacts. The hull was adorned with plates of steel that had been recently added.

  "What are those plates on the hull for?" She asked as she boarded.

  "Ice. The ocean is full of it now. Especially near Ulukoma We need something to break up the larger chunks so they don't damage the rest of the boat."

  "I didn't know it was that cold already."

  "These days go by quickly."

  Melna slid her hands along all the ropes and poles that would soon be put to into action, wondering how many of ther crew she still had left.

  "Ramne. Who is Ramne?"

  "I've heard of him," Pomri chimed in. "He used to be some nobody in the Rudjan guard who thought he was smarter than the rest of us. Never got promoted, so he just left us one day without a trace."


  Linyu whimpered in fear at his name, drawing Pomri's attention.

  "Eh? What's gotten into you?" she asked.

  Thi was getting ready to jump off of Laen-Laen and run, but Melna had already become aware of hae and leapt back to hae.

  "Hey, Linyu. What's wrong?" asked Melna, holding onto hae arms.

  "Ramne," thi said in a cracked voice, "He..."

  Tears were forming at the corners of hae eyes.

  "What did he do?"

  "Mom," thi said, at the end of hae wit.




  "I take it you're not a boat person. Well, we can't go back now so you're either coming with us or you're on your own again."

  Thi took a moment, feeling angry at the predicament thi was put into. There was nowhere to run, standing outside a massive city barred from entry, and Laen-Laen, who could take hae anywhere if anywhere were safe anymore. Thi placed hae hand on Kip's pendant under hae shirt and closed hae eyes in thought.

  "Together," thi whispered. Pomri smiled at hae courage.



"The train here is shut down too," Pomri said with disappointment.

"Nevermind that I need to speak with Linyu," said Melna.

"What's gotten into you?" Pomri asked, suspicious.

Melna stooped to Linyu's level and gazed into hae firey blue eyes. She was sure that the woman had them too.

"Do you know a woman named Ginnu and a possibly her partner?" she asked.

Linyu was shocked, "H-How.."

"I need to know, Linyu. Please tell me. Who are they?"

"Kanosin"

"They sell kanosin?"

Thi nodded in confirmation.

"Did you know they are looking for you?"

Hae hands began to tremble and she grasped them in comfort.

"Why are they after you?"

Thi pointed to the listener in hae ear.

"Why is this thing so important? What does it do?"

Thi began to cry but held hae wits together while trying to find a way to explain.

Melna pressed for simpler answers.

"is it a weapon, some new material?"

Thi took the listener off hae ear and gave it to Melna, who hesitantly put it up to her ear.

"I can hear strange static sounds. Where is it coming from?"

Linyu gestured all around, wishing thi had hae transmitter there.

Pomri interjected, "You're wasting your time with this nonsense."

"Wait. I can hear someone talking," she said, still listening intently. She tried to hear the words, but could only hear a few through the noise.

"What are they talking about?" she asked Linyu again.

But instead of an answer Linyu held hae hand up to hae ear, telling her to keep listening.

She listened closer and then heard an unmistakeable voice of the maman who woke up early to sit under a tree. Who dressed her before she went to Shaki and gave her a kiss on the forehead even when thi was unhappy with her.

"Liffa! You're alive!"



  "Please," Melna sniffled and looked down. "Keep mine with you as well. I do not know what fate lies before me, only that it will be dark and obscured from me. It would bring me peace to know that him and I are together in some small way, living apart from ."

  She pressed it tightly against hae chest, taking time to cherish the memories of the man and maman she loved and to remember the oath of protection which she was desparately trying to keep. Her hands lifted the pendant from her neck and place it over Melna's.
