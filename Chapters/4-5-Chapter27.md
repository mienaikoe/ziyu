## Chapter 27

"Laen!" I called out. There was no answer, no sign. Not even his giant footsteps stuck around in the dust.

"This is the place we left him, right?" I asked. I knew it was.

"Perhaps he got thirsty," said Pomri, "Went to Rudjan for a drink."

"No. That's not like him. He must have had a good reason."

"Well, anyway, we need to get moving."

"Let's wait just a little while longer."

I could hear her incredulity. "You care so much for that saffa."

"He cares for me. Why should I not treat him the same?"

"He's a saffa. In Holrag, they eat saffas, you know."

I shuddered at the thought.

"He has a mind," I said. "He's capable of love. Of suffering. And every feeling in between. He's shown me the good that life is capable of. That's enough for me."

"Can't argue with that," she said. "Anyway, we need to get moving before the Holragi come back to ransack the place."

I weighed the options, and realized she was right. Being captured or killed wouldn't help us find each other again. So I stood up and trudged onward, pulled through my mental viscidity by the unstoppable force that was Pomri.

"Don't look back," she said as I glanced over my shoulder one last time. "You'll only make it worse."

---

Pomri took one look at the shore near the cove and knew that something was amiss. There seemed to be a distinct and imprecise absence of rock and sand, as if a struggle had taken place.

"No," she said, worried. "No. Not the boat."

She lit her lantern with haste and checked the area for evidence of movement.

"A path has been carved out of the land here. And look!"

She pointed to a trail of blood with light specks of kanosin that led into the cove.

_Specks? Peculiar._

I kneeled down to get a closer look, and before I noticed, she entered the cove. I had to follow.

"This. This is not good," she said as she searched everywhere for the canoe we had arrived on. I saw the divot where it had been, with streaks of algae running down into the water. It was clear it had been stolen.

"DAMN IT ALL!" she said, pushing me aside and rushing out of the cove to search for it on the horizon. Again I took off following her, but I noticed something strange in the distance. A dull surface when all else was shining and wet from the light on my legs. As I approached, a strange but familiar voice spoke in the cove.

"I tried to stop him," thi said.

My bones shivered as I froze in place, and the figure of a maman appeared a few paces from me where the dullness had been. Thi was in dark and tattered clothes that matched the ones on the maman who fled when we arrived.

"Tried to stop who? Who are you?"

"Who's asking?"

"L-Linyu. My name is Linyu."

The maman didn't move, but I drew closer and knealt by hae side.

Thi introduced herself, "The one that came before me was named Ginnu."

I interjected excitedly, "Ginnu! You disappeared after the battle. What happened to you?"

"Ginnu died and is forgotten. I am _Annu_, one without a name."

My curiosity noticed a pendant around hae neck, moved me closer to see it.

"You knew... Melna?" I asked.

Hae voice perked up, "You know Melna?"

"Yes! She took me in when I woke up in Heiko..."

"What happened to her?" thi asked in a subdued sort of excitement.

A brief glimpse of her death flashed in my mind, and all the myriad emotions that went with it, crammed into a moment. Ginnu saw my stare, heard my silence, and knew.

"She prepared her people for what was to come. Bought us time to save most of them."

In a slow gesture, thi grasped my hands with hae own and held silence between our palms.

"Is something the matter?" I asked, changing the subject. And with the same gentle movement, thi led my fingers underneath a layer of damp kelp on the side of hae abdomen. My fingers traced a wound, long, deep, and healing poorly. I looked through the eyes my mother gave me, looked inside the body with my mind, imagined hae voice present through my own. _Right-side filter gills are immediately below the laceration, torn. Bleeding has stopped, but hae blood is acidifying. Infection is likely. This was meant to kill hae slowly._

"Come," I said, still speaking , "Let's get you out into the light."

"I... I am too weak."

"We can heal you. We have some vials of-" _We used it all._ "We can get you to a place where you'll be safe."

"Nowhere is safe now."

"There is such a place," I reassured hae, "It's hidden, in the darkness. The Holragi wouldn't know to go there."

"The underworld..." thi looked through me as hae thoughts drifted off. "If you've come to take me back... I'm not going anywhere."

_Underworld?_

"I don't know of any underworld. Only of Ulukoma. There are many doctors there that can help you."

"Doctors have no business with the dead."

"But you aren't dead."

Thi looked at me with cold, untrusting eyes.

"I was born in the darkness, where life and death have lost their meaning. I was a ghost there, one of millions. But He... he brought me back somehow."

My breaths were shallow with a terrified imagination.

"I cannot bring myself to go back to that place," she said with trepidation, "But I will go with you if you promise me something, young maman."

_Maman... I'd never been called that._

I bowed my head curtly in confirmation.

"That man that stole your boat. That tried to kill me. His name is Ramne."

_Damn him._

She continued, "He's the one that brought me back. If you see him, or hear of him. Run. Go far far away and never come back."

"What about you?"

"You heard me."

Hae memories were shrouded from me but haunted me nevertheless. What deed so terrible to cause such pain could Ramne have done. And to what end? I cast the thoughts out of my mind, and regained focus.

"I'll be right back," I said, and ran to Pomri who had surely not given up looking for the boat.

"Pomri?"

I called, but neither heard nor saw her. Perhaps she was further out than I thought.

"Pomriii!"

I began to pace across the pebbles and sand, to look for some trace of her or to calm my nerves, but saw and heard no sign.

_Did she leave without me?_

Such cynicism in my thoughts suprised me.

_Would Pomri do such a thing? Would she have gone back alone? Setre wouldn't hesitate to kill her._

Then the manic anxiety took hold and I began to doubt one thing after another.

_Maybe she was a Holragi spy and she's finished her job. No, she couldn't be. She wouldn-_

But then my eye caught a blue light on the pebbles. An eddy of kanosin within an undisturbed puddle of water and blood. And a large divot in the pebbles around it.

_An accident while moving a secret boat? No- a struggle. How had I not heard this?_

I took a deep breath and sat before the puddle. Drowning my thoughts in its patterns. I didn't want them anymore.

"Ginnu... Annu," I said aloud to myself. "Thi needs me. I can't do this right now."

Another deep breath and I whisked myself back around toward the cove. I had walked much further away than I had realized.

"G- Annu," I addressed hae keeping my voice as stable as I could, "we have to go. Pomri is gone."

"Gone? Gone where?"

"I don't know. I just found some blood and-," I stopped and fell to my feet in front of hae. Thi reached out to hold me in hae arms, swallowing the pain in her side; her breath, slow and belabored, tickling the back of my shoulder.

"Be still, maman. Quiet your mind."

She calmed me with the sound of her voice and the feel of her warmth. The sound of distant waves and tiny plops of water filled my mind, carried me away to the depths of my mind.

"Your hearts are full," thi said running hae fingers through my hair. Hae voice was like a pool of warm water in the frozen air.

"You care for her. For Pomri. More than you care for yourself. But you are conflicted. You have the eyes of Ramne, cunning, determined. You see opportunity and destruction as one, a vast continuum upon which we all wander about. You will be a great leader someday, in a time without time. But first you must lead yourself to the right answer."

Thi let me go, and I followed, knealing before hae with my face still covered with water. Hae hand came up to wipe it away. I took a few deep breaths and set my mind back into the calm of its deepest parts. Pomri came to mind. The way her hands would have moved in the dark, pushing a boat out to sea.

"Pomri would never make such a clumsy mistake," I said calmly. "And she would never leave me behind. Pomri was taken."

The frantic feeling I had before resurfaced, charged with with a mix of anger and fear.

"They're still out there, hunting us down," I said, standing up. Instinctively, I began to pace around in a circle, holding a head full of the worst imagined thoughts.

"All of Heiko has been exiled, enslaved, murdered. They didn't want to live their last days in the shadow of a tyrant. So the Holragi erased them."

My legs gave way and I fell to my knees.

"Pomri!" I cried for her and my voice reverberated across the walls, reaching into every corner of the cove for an ear to fall on.

I asked, "What do we do?"

A soft whine echoed faintly through the air, joined by a chorus of heavy footsteps upon the pebbles. I need not beg for my heart to soften.

"Laen. Boon," I said aloud as they came into the light. Laen nuzzled me while Boon-Boon laid her head in Annu's lap.

Thi gently propped haeself up and cleared hae throat. There was a sense in that cove that hope was still alive. It energized us just enough to not want to end it all.

"Linyu, this world is full of chaos," thi said, "All of us have been caught in an undercurrent of deception. Of deranged forces vying for the last surviving bits of power. And people who would kill everyone in order to save themselves for one more day."

I silently agreed.

"Perhaps it's time we fought back."

I took her words into my heart through the sweat on my cheeks and in my eyes. And my lungs had never felt so full of life.

"The same one that looked after Laen, I presume. Does thi know where our boat is?" she asked nonchalantly.

"A man named Ramne took it. But-"

The mystery was enough to pull her attention away from the ocean for a moment and look at me in disbelief.

"A man? There was someone else out here?"

"Thi has a huge gash on hae abdomen. Thi needs disinfectant and a bicarb tonic."

"And we need a boat."

"Are you listening to yourself?" I said, incredulous. "A maman is on the verge of death and you're raving about a boat."

"How do you think we'll be able to help hae without one?"

"You could start by giving hae some hope."

She looked at me as if to see me for the first time.

"You remember what I said on that crater. Nobody here will survive. As much as we want to help them, it's a lost cause."

"And you would abandon someone to make sure you're right?"

"To make sure you and I survive? I absolutely would. A maman on hae deathbed is dead weight."

<!--
- I want Pomri to be separated from Linyu

      - Can do this from Ulukoma if they learn how to focus their beam
        - From who?
          - Repetition can make the trees understand timing and send a stronger signal?
            - Timing would have to be impeccable
              - Modulation would make it not terrible. They'd have to modulate anyway to get sound
              - Beam Forming Trees? That sounds rad.
              - How would the trees know where to beam form? Do they always beam form to Ara? Why?
                - No life toward Ulu
                - Circular "Beam Forming" to send signal in a circle around Ulukoma. Def falls into the LOS of Liffa.
    - Setre saves Liffa

- Okay, but also they could adventure into the depths of Ulu
  - To find some ancient alter that saves them? Deus Ex much?
  - Or... ok. how about a shitton of Kanosin?
  - Or like that volcanic pathway where Casra/Kipnu/Lissa died. Maybe it's a pathway that leads somewhere.
    - Graveyard of eternity

- Annui?
  - Saves Liffa?
  - Taken Laen?
  - Goes to Rudjan?
  - Begs them to take hae with them
    - Is the key to understanding the graveyard of eternity
      - Volcanic Bioreactor of Kanosin Kelp
        - Feeds on Volcanic Energy
        - You must die to wake up again (sacrifice)
          - How do they die?
          - They are afraid
  - Graveyard of eternity = cryochamber in deep Ulu
    - Kanosin is how they get out of it when the time comes
