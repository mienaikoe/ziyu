## Chapter 27

"Laen?" I called for him

<!--
- I want Pomri to be separated from Linyu
- I want to explore Holrag

- Pomri can go to Ulukoma, while Linyu is captured by Ramne
  - Always captured ugh
-
- Boating accident where Linyu gets washed into the water
  - Too late for Kanosin to save him
  - Wakes up on Shinna's boat
    - Shinna/Ramne? One of them would have to tell Linyu
    - Goes to Holrag
    - Communicates with Liffa
      - Can do this from Ulukoma if they learn how to focus their beam
        - From who?
          - Repetition can make the trees understand timing and send a stronger signal?
            - Timing would have to be impeccable
              - Modulation would make it not terrible. They'd have to modulate anyway to get sound
              - Beam Forming Trees? That sounds rad.
              - How would the trees know where to beam form? Do they always beam form to Ara? Why?
                - No life toward Ulu
                - Circular "Beam Forming" to send signal in a circle around Ulukoma. Def falls into the LOS of Liffa.
    - Setre saves Liffa

- Okay, but also they could adventure into the depths of Ulu
  - To find some ancient alter that saves them? Deus Ex much?
  - Or... ok. how about a shitton of Kanosin?
  - Or like that volcanic pathway where Casra/Kipnu/Lissa died. Maybe it's a pathway that leads somewhere.
    - Graveyard of eternity

- Annui?
  - Saves Liffa?
  - Taken Laen?
  - Goes to Rudjan?
  - Begs them to take hae with them
    - Is the key to understanding the graveyard of eternity
      - Volcanic Bioreactor of Kanosin Kelp
        - Feeds on Volcanic Energy
        - You must die to wake up again (sacrifice)
          - How do they die?
          - They are afraid
  - Graveyard of eternity = cryochamber in deep Ulu
    - Kanosin is how they get out of it when the time comes


Ch27
- Their boat is stolen
  - By Ramne, but don't mention this
- They presume it's Annui and track hae
- They meet with Annui, and reconvene the saffas who tells them about the graveyard
  - Under Ulu, sleeps millions of beings. For you to survive, you must kill them.
-
