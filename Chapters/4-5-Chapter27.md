## Chapter 27

"Laen!" I called out. There was no answer, no sign. Not even his giant footsteps stuck around in the dust.

"This is the place we left him, right?" I asked. I knew it was.

"Perhaps he got thirsty," said Pomri, "Went to Rudjan for a drink."

"No. That's not like him. He must have had a good reason."

"Well, anyway, we need to get moving."

"Let's wait just a little while longer."

I could hear her incredulity. "You care so much for that saffa."

"He cares for me. Why should I not treat him the same?"

"He's a saffa. In Holrag, they eat saffas, you know."

I shuddered at the thought.

"He has a mind," I said. "He's capable of love. Of suffering. And every feeling in between. He's shown me the good that life is capable of. That's enough for me."

"Can't argue with that," she said. "Anyway, we need to get moving before the Holragi come back to ransack the place."

I weighed the options, and realized she was right. Being captured or killed wouldn't help us find each other again. So I stood up and trudged onward, pulled through my mental viscidity by the unstoppable force that was Pomri.

"Don't look back," she said as I glanced over my shoulder one last time. "You'll only make it worse."

---

Pomri took one look at the shore near the cove and knew that something was amiss. There seemed to be a distinct and imprecise absence of rock and sand, as if a struggle had taken place here.

"No," she said, worried. "No. Not the boat."

She lit her lantern quicker than I thought it could be done and entered the cove ahead of me.

"This. This is not good," she said as she searched everywhere for the canoe we had arrived on. I saw the divot where it had been, with streaks of algae running down into the water. It was clear it had been stolen.

"DAMMIT!" she said, pushing me aside and rushing out of the cove to search for it on the horizon. She was long gone when a strange but familiar voice spoke in the cove.

"I tried to stop him," thi said.

A shiver filled my bones, turning me around to find the source. The blue light on my legs revealed the figure of a maman a few paces from me. In dark and tattered clothes. The same one we encountered when we arrived.

"Tried to stop who? Who are you?"

"Who's asking?"

"L-Linyu. My name is Linyu."

The maman didn't move, but I drew closer and knealt by hae side.

Thi introduced herself, "The one that came before me was named Ginnu."

I interjected excitedly, "Ginnu! You disappeared after the battle. What happened to you?"

"Ginnu died and is forgotten. I am _Annu_, one without a name."

My curiosity noticed a pendant around hae neck, moved me closer to see it.

"You knew... Melna?" I asked.

Hae voice perked up, "You know Melna?"

"Yes! She took me in when I woke up in Heiko..."

"What happened to her?" thi asked in a subdued sort of excitement.

A brief glimpse of her death flashed in my mind, and all the myriad emotions that went with it, crammed into a moment. Ginnu saw my stare, heard my silence, and knew.

"She prepared her people for what was to come. Bought us time to save most of them."

In a slow gesture, thi grasped my hands with hae own and held silence between our palms.

"Is something the matter?" I asked, changing the subject. And with the same gentle movement, thi led my fingers underneath a layer of damp kelp on the side of hae abdomen. My fingers traced a wound, long, deep, and healing poorly. I looked through the eyes my mother gave me, looked inside the body with my mind, imagined hae voice present through my own. _Right-side filter gills are immediately below the laceration, torn. Bleeding has stopped, but hae blood is acidifying. Infection is likely. This was meant to kill hae slowly._

"Come," I said, still speaking , "Let's get you out into the light."

"I... I am too weak."

"We can heal you. We have some vials of-" _We used it all._ "We can get you to a place where you'll be safe."

"Nowhere is safe now."

"There is such a place," I reassured hae, "It's hidden, in the darkness. The Holragi wouldn't know to go there."

"The underworld..." thi looked through me as hae thoughts drifted off. "If you've come to take me back... I'm not going anywhere."

_Underworld?_

"I don't know of any underworld. Only of Ulukoma. There are many doctors there that can help you."

"Doctors have no business with the dead."

"And you aren't dead."

Thi looked at me with cold, untrusting eyes. _What happened to you, Ginnu?_

With trepidation in hae voice, thi made an agreement, "I will go with you if you promise me something, young maman."

_Maman... I'd never been called that._

I bowed my head curtly in confirmation.

"That man that stole your boat. That tried to kill me. His name is Ramne."

_Damn him._

She continued, "If you see him, or hear of him. Run. Go far far away and never come back."

"What about you?"

"You heard me."

Hae memories were shrouded from me but haunted me nevertheless. What deed so terrible to cause such pain could Ramne have done. And to what end? I cast the thoughts out of my mind, and regained focus.

"I'll be right back," I said, and ran to Pomri who had all but given up on finding the boat.

"Pomri, there is a maman in the cove that needs our help."

"The same one that looked after Laen, I presume. Does thi know where our boat is?" she asked nonchalantly.

"A man named Ramne took it. But-"

The mystery was enough to pull her attention away from the ocean for a moment and look at me in disbelief.

"A man? There was someone else out here?"

"Thi has a huge gash on hae abdomen. Thi needs disinfectant and a bicarb tonic."

"And we need a boat."

"Are you listening to yourself?" I said, incredulous. "A maman is on the verge of death and you're raving about a boat."

"How do you think we'll be able to help hae without one?"

"You could start by giving hae some hope."

She looked at me as if to see me for the first time.

"You remember what I said on that crater. Nobody here will survive. As much as we want to help them, it's a lost cause."

"And you would abandon someone to make sure you're right?"

"To make sure you and I survive? I absolutely would. A maman on hae deathbed is dead weight."

<!--
- I want Pomri to be separated from Linyu
- I want to explore Holrag

- Pomri can go to Ulukoma, while Linyu is captured by Ramne
  - Always captured ugh
-
- Boating accident where Linyu gets washed into the water
  - Too late for Kanosin to save him
  - Wakes up on Shinna's boat
    - Shinna/Ramne? One of them would have to tell Linyu
    - Goes to Holrag
    - Communicates with Liffa
      - Can do this from Ulukoma if they learn how to focus their beam
        - From who?
          - Repetition can make the trees understand timing and send a stronger signal?
            - Timing would have to be impeccable
              - Modulation would make it not terrible. They'd have to modulate anyway to get sound
              - Beam Forming Trees? That sounds rad.
              - How would the trees know where to beam form? Do they always beam form to Ara? Why?
                - No life toward Ulu
                - Circular "Beam Forming" to send signal in a circle around Ulukoma. Def falls into the LOS of Liffa.
    - Setre saves Liffa

- Okay, but also they could adventure into the depths of Ulu
  - To find some ancient alter that saves them? Deus Ex much?
  - Or... ok. how about a shitton of Kanosin?
  - Or like that volcanic pathway where Casra/Kipnu/Lissa died. Maybe it's a pathway that leads somewhere.
    - Graveyard of eternity

- Annui?
  - Saves Liffa?
  - Taken Laen?
  - Goes to Rudjan?
  - Begs them to take hae with them
    - Is the key to understanding the graveyard of eternity
      - Volcanic Bioreactor of Kanosin Kelp
        - Feeds on Volcanic Energy
        - You must die to wake up again (sacrifice)
          - How do they die?
          - They are afraid
  - Graveyard of eternity = cryochamber in deep Ulu
    - Kanosin is how they get out of it when the time comes
