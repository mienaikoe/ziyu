## Chapter 27

"Laen!" I called out. There was no answe, no sign. Not even his giant footsteps stuck around in the dust.

"This is the place we left him, right?" I asked. I knew it was.

"Perhaps he got thirsty," said Pomri, "Went to Rudjan for a drink."

"No. That's not like him. He must have had a good reason."

"Well, anyway, we need to get moving."

"Let's wait just a little while longer."

I could hear her incredulity. "You care so much for that saffa."

"He cares for me. Why should I not treat him the same?"

"He's a saffa. In Holrag, they eat saffas, you know."

I shuddered at the thought.

"He has a mind," I said. "He's capable of love. Of suffering. And every feeling in between. He's shown me the good that life is capable of. That's enough for me."

"Can't argue with that," she said. "Anyway, we need to get moving before the Holragi come back to ransack the place."

I weighed the options, and realized she was right. Being captured or killed wouldn't help us find each other again. So I stood up and trudged onward, pulled through my mental viscidity by the unstoppable force that was Pomri.

"Don't look back," she said as I glanced over my shoulder one last time. "You'll only make it worse."

Pomri took one look at the shore near the cove and knew that something was amiss. There seemed to be a distinct and imprecise absence of rock and sand, as if a struggle had taken place here.

"No," she said, worried. "No. Not the boat."

She lit her lantern quicker than I thought it could be done and entered the cove ahead of me.

"This. This is not good," she said as she searched everywhere for the canoe we had arrived on. I saw the divot where it had been, with streaks of algae running down into the water. It was clear it had been stolen.

"DAMMIT!" she said, pushing me aside and rushing out of the cove to search for it on the horizon.

A strange but familiar voice spoke in the cove.

"I tried to stop him."

The shiver filled my bones, turning me around to find the source. The blue light on my legs revealed the figure of a maman a few paces from me. In dark and tattered clothes. The same one we encountered when we arrived.

"Tried to stop who? Who are you?"

"You two are so rude, barging into my home twice like this and interrogating me like I'm some criminal."

I made a heavy gulp.

"I'm just scared is all. Who are you?"

The maman didn't move, but I drew closer and knealt by hae side.

"The one that came before me was named Ginnu."

I interjected excitedly, "Ginnu! It's you! What do you mean came before?"

"I am _Annui_, without a name."

I took a closer look at pendant around hae neck and noticed it immediately.

"How did you come to have Melna's pendant?"

"You know Melna?"

"Yes! But how..."

We shared a confused moment of silence, realizing that we ought to regroup in the light.

"Come, let's get you out into the light."

"I... I am too weak to do that right now."

<!--
- I want Pomri to be separated from Linyu
- I want to explore Holrag

- Pomri can go to Ulukoma, while Linyu is captured by Ramne
  - Always captured ugh
-
- Boating accident where Linyu gets washed into the water
  - Too late for Kanosin to save him
  - Wakes up on Shinna's boat
    - Shinna/Ramne? One of them would have to tell Linyu
    - Goes to Holrag
    - Communicates with Liffa
      - Can do this from Ulukoma if they learn how to focus their beam
        - From who?
          - Repetition can make the trees understand timing and send a stronger signal?
            - Timing would have to be impeccable
              - Modulation would make it not terrible. They'd have to modulate anyway to get sound
              - Beam Forming Trees? That sounds rad.
              - How would the trees know where to beam form? Do they always beam form to Ara? Why?
                - No life toward Ulu
                - Circular "Beam Forming" to send signal in a circle around Ulukoma. Def falls into the LOS of Liffa.
    - Setre saves Liffa

- Okay, but also they could adventure into the depths of Ulu
  - To find some ancient alter that saves them? Deus Ex much?
  - Or... ok. how about a shitton of Kanosin?
  - Or like that volcanic pathway where Casra/Kipnu/Lissa died. Maybe it's a pathway that leads somewhere.
    - Graveyard of eternity

- Annui?
  - Saves Liffa?
  - Taken Laen?
  - Goes to Rudjan?
  - Begs them to take hae with them
    - Is the key to understanding the graveyard of eternity
      - Volcanic Bioreactor of Kanosin Kelp
        - Feeds on Volcanic Energy
        - You must die to wake up again (sacrifice)
          - How do they die?
          - They are afraid
  - Graveyard of eternity = cryochamber in deep Ulu
    - Kanosin is how they get out of it when the time comes
