## Chapter 27

"Laen!" I called out. There was no answer, no sign. Not even his giant footsteps stuck around in the dust.

"This is the place we left him, right?" I asked. I knew it was.

"Perhaps he got thirsty," said Pomri, "Went to Rudjan for a drink."

"No. That's not like him. He must have had a good reason."

"Well, anyway, we need to get moving."

"Let's wait just a little while longer."

I could hear her incredulity. "You care so much for that saffa."

"He cares for me. Why should I not treat him the same?"

"He's a saffa. In Holrag, they eat saffas, you know."

I shuddered at the thought.

"He has a mind," I said. "He's capable of love. Of suffering. And every feeling in between. He's shown me the good that life is capable of. That's enough for me."

"Can't argue with that," she said. "Anyway, we need to get moving before the Holragi come back to ransack the place."

I weighed the options, and realized she was right. Being captured or killed wouldn't help us find each other again. So I stood up and trudged onward, pulled through my mental viscidity by the unstoppable force that was Pomri.

"Don't look back," she said as I glanced over my shoulder one last time. "You'll only make it worse."

---

Pomri took one look at the shore near the cove and knew that something was amiss. There seemed to be a distinct and imprecise absence of rock and sand, as if a struggle had taken place.

"No," she said, worried. "No. Not the boat."

She lit her lantern with haste and checked the area for evidence of movement.

"A path has been carved out of the land here. And look!"

She pointed to a trail of blood with light specks of kanosin that led into the cove.

_Specks? Peculiar._

I kneeled down to get a closer look, and before I noticed, she entered the cove. I had to follow.

"This. This is not good," she said as she searched everywhere for the canoe we had arrived on. I saw the divot where it had been, with streaks of dark volcanic plankton running down into the water. It was clear it had been stolen.

"DAMN IT ALL!" she said, pushing me aside and rushing out of the cove to search for it on the horizon. I turned around again to follow her, but my breath gave way to exhaustion and my legs felt an ache they had never felt before. I trudged slowly to the entrance and fell to a kneal, unable to move any further. I watched on as the faint blue light in Pomri's hand bobbed and swayed with each step, constantly looking out for a boat, receding into the evening light along the shore to Rudjan. Until it stopped.

My eyes tried to focus on the blue glow as a dozen bright amber spotlights suddenly came alive from a place in the water. _Slavers!_

"Pomri!" I said, quickly rising to my feet. But my muscles refused to work enough to muster a run, much less a sprint. The blue glow was blotted out by the amber lights, and I could see her in full light now, holdinig her spear defensively. A crew of five spotlights emerged from the source of the spotlights, holding their lights to her, and the minute they set foot on land, she sprung into action, taking out one of the slavers. But the other four quickly bound her with weighted nets and wrested away her spear with a rope anchor. "Pomri!" I called out to her, and immediately two of the amber lights turned my way, impaling the dark with their beams. Somehow, the distance between us had become immeasurable, as if some illusion had been cast onto by the intense beams of theiir lanterns. Without a pause, they ran after me but I just stood there, my mind faltering and petrified in their light.

From behind me, a voice called "Aye!" and a small army of feet pattered against the rock. I huddled in anticipation, but the steps passed by me and charged ahead toward the lights. Through the lantern lights, I saw their silhouettes: a maman dressed in a dark and tattered robe with a paddle in hae hand; two saffas were further ahead, galloping their quickest toward the lights emerging from the water.

Across the beach, the maman scaled the darkness and took the two slavers by surprise. The struggle played out only a few paces before me. The sound of breaking glass rang out; one of the lanterns was extinguished. The other flailed about as if reaching to land a blow upon any sign of movement. Between the commotion of sound and the bright washed out patterns in my eyes, nothing was clear, but I knew that thi had given me the chance to flee to safety. _The cove_. With what little strength that remained in my limbs, I crawled back and waited just inside the mouth of the tunnel for some sign of friend or foe.

The commotion outside came to a stop, and I saw the last light flicker and fade. From the eerie calm, a sound began. Some heavy object being scraped against the rock and then a splash, shallow but just enough. Then again. The sweet smell of Anomin oil mingled with the salty mist in my nose. And I could have sworn that such a pleasant pair of odors came together to taste like metal at the back of my throat. I did not like it.

Cautiously, I emerged from my hiding, tracing the edge of the beach toward where I thought the sounds had come from. The amber lights both near and far had vanished and I could barely see the ground at this time of day. I could hear the sounds of shifting pebbles at a distance, the saffas finding their way back. In front of me, upon a flat rock jutting out from the shore, the maman had flung haeself with hae back to the sky, breathing heavily through hae teeth.

I began, "Are-"

But thi pulled the paddle from beside hae and raised it to my neck in the blink of an eye. Through the blue light, I could see hae eyes, narrowed and hyper-aware.

I chill of trembles shook my body with fear. "Are you alright?" I asked.

And with the same swift movement thi set the paddle down and sat back against the rock with hae lower body submerged in the little waves. I passed my hand over her and could see a makeshift bandage off damp kelp on hae abdomen, and the thick black of blood in a blue light.

"You're wounded," I said.

"I've had worse," thi said nonchalantly.

With a gesture of permission and a gentle motion I led my hand underneath the bandage. My fingers traced a wound, long, deep, and jagged. I looked through the eyes my mother gave me, looked inside the body with my mind, imagined hae voice present through my own. _Right-side filter gills are immediately below the laceration, torn. Bleeding has stopped, but hae blood is acidifying. Infection is likely. This will kill hae slowly without proper medical help._

"You need," I said panicked, "I need to get you to a doctor."

"I... I am too weak."

I reached into my bag. "I have some vials of- ... I can get you to a place where you'll be safe."

"Nowhere is safe now."

"There is such a place," I reassured hae, "It's hidden, in the darkness. The Holragi wouldn't know to go there."

"The underworld..." thi looked through me as hae thoughts drifted off. "I'm not going back."

_Underworld?_

"I don't know of any underworld. Only of Ulukoma. There is a doctor there that can help you."

"A doctor has no business with the dead."

"But you aren't dead."

Thi looked at me with cold, untrusting eyes. A saffa approached, growling at the blue light from my hand until the maman spoke.

"It's ok," she said with a gentle tone. The saffa immediately stopped growling and shook its head with a jingling sound.

"I found you!" I yelled to him, and he let out a loud, "Woooooop!"

From a distance, the other saffa cried toward the ocean, "Wooooooooooo." It was Boon.

Laen and I carried the maman to the edge of the entry, where there was ample height and space from the water. Even if we were there until morning, we would've been safe from the tide.

"I could have stopped them," thi said as Laen made his side available as a bed for the maman.

"Those filthy slavers," thi explained, "They got your companion. Would've killed you. You're too small to be useful to them."

I apologized with a shameful silence, realizing that I had unwittingly drawn their attention.

"No remorse," thi said with conviction. "This isn't the time."

I was grateful for hae thinking so, but the guilt held fast. I spoke in a broken voice, "Pomri is... a slave now. She can't escape."

"Be still, maman. Quiet your mind."

"I've been begging it to stop!"

"There's nothing could be done to save her, and no way to take it back."

I drew closer and knealt by hae side while Boon let out another howl in the distance. It shook me.

Thi asked me, "What's your name, young maman?"

"L-Linyu," I said, "My name is Linyu."

Thi introduced herself, "The one that came before me was named Ginnu."

"Ginnu!" I interjected excitedly. "You disappeared after the battle. What happened to you?"

"Battle? Whatever battles Ginnu fought, thi died and is forgotten. I am _Annu_, one without a name."

"Annu..." I repeated but did not understand. A pendant around hae neck caught my eye and unraveled my curiosity. I took a closer look to make sure it was the genuine article.

"You knew... Melna?" I asked.

"What happened to her?" thi asked in a subdued sort of excitement, "How do you know her?"

A brief glimpse of her death flashed in my mind, and all the myriad emotions that went with it, crammed into a moment. Ginnu saw my stare, heard my silence, and understood.

Hae voice perked up, "_You_ know Melna?"

"She took me in when I woke up in Heiko," I said, grasping at my own voice for answers, "We fled with Pomri to Rudjan, but then we were separated. Spies."

I regained my pride for her. "She prepared her people for what was to come. Bought us time to save most of them."

In a slow gesture, thi grasped my hands with hae own and held silence between our palms.

"Melna brought me an antidote," Thi explained, "I was born in the dark, blind, but by whatever magic she infused in that glass vial of hers, I was able to see again. I jumped ship and swam to the shore, but she chose to stay behind. Perhaps she had some unfinished business to tend to."

I took note of the kanosin blue in hae eyes: faint but evident. If thi had been given antikan, then thi must have had another dose of kanosin afterward. But how?

"Gi- Annu. We must find the boat and get you to safety."

"Boat? Safety? Bah - they're both gone."

"What do you mean?"

"He took it," thi said. Her voice was cryptic and longing tone.

"...Who?"

Thi paused, struggling to come up with the thoughts that would lead her to the words thi wanted to say.

"I was born in the darkness. A place where life and death no longer held any meaning. I was a ghost there, one of millions. But He... he brought me back to the world of the living."

My breaths were shallow with a terrified imagination of such a place, but still I pressed.

"What is his name?" I asked.

Thi said with a shudder, "Ramne."

The pores in my skin contracted. _What is he up to now?_

"He stole death from me. I was his murder slave. Trapped on his ship, teetering between life and death. I was unable to see, to escape. Then Melna set me free. I have died so many times I can no longer remember. But always, life is at the other end. It is an illness I would rather be rid of."

"You... can't die? But that's–"

"A gift? I don't fear death, maman, I fear life. For life means another death is coming."

I was taken aback by what thi was saying. A gift so powerful was wasted on someone who wished it gone. That evilest of wishes crossed my mind, too: so careless as to wish immortality on a friend instead of an acquaintence. But I stopped myself from lending it any time. _It doesn't become me_, as my mother would say.

I asked hae, "What do you mean by 'ghost'?"

Hae eyes looked past me as if imagining some other place.

"I was there, with all of them. I knew I had died. And yet, I was at peace with it. It was the parasite. It keeps you barely alive and holds you in its own dream world."

"Parasite?"

Hae eyes returned their gaze to me.

"I cannot bring myself to leave. Ramne is there. I know it," she said. "But I will go with you if you promise me something, young maman."

_Maman... I'd never been called that._

I bowed my head curtly in confirmation.

She continued, "If you see Ramne, or hear of him. Run. Run far far away and never come back."

"What about you?"

"You heard me."

Hae memories were shrouded from me but haunted me nevertheless. What deed so terrible could Ramne have done to cause such pain. And to what end?

The sound of distant waves and the tiny plops of water on rocky puddles filled me, carried me away to the depths of my mind. Anny saw how I'd been spooked and held my hand, calmed me with the warmth of hae touch and the sound of hae voice.

"Your hearts are full," thi said running hae fingers through my hair. Hae voice was like a pool of warm water in the frozen air.

"Full of fear," I replied, "Of anger."

"And of love. You cared for Melna. And you care for Pomri. More than you care for yourself. But you are conflicted. You have his eyes. Cunning, determined. You see the flow of old and new, a vast continuum upon which life wanders. You will be a great leader someday, in a time long from now, where everything old has been lost, and make room for the new."

I tried to understand what thi was saying, but I was frustrated. "I have no power, no talents. I command respect from no one. How can I lead without–"

"Shh...," thi said. "You will see what I can see. One day."

I took a few deep breaths and set my mind back into the calm of its deepest parts. Pomri came to mind and the frantic feeling took hold again. I stood up, contemplating what her life might be like from now on. And then I remembered the stories my nather told me: of mining for ore, escaping from Holrag. And I couldn't hold in my anger any loonger.

"They're still out there, hunting us down," I said, standing up. Instinctively, I began to pace around in a circle, holding a head full of the worst imagined thoughts. "All of Heiko has been exiled, enslaved, murdered. They didn't want to live the last of their days in the shadow of a tyrant. So the tyrant erased them. Ulukoma is next."

I was angry now, recalling every injustice, every act of intimidation and coercion. And my face was flush with water.

"Dammit!!" I screamed and my voice reverberated across the walls, reaching into every corner and every rock. A soft whine echoed faintly through the air, joined by a chorus of heavy footsteps upon the pebbles.

"Boon..."

She walked slowly to us, sniffed on me and laid herself next to Laen with a deep sigh. There was an air of despair in that cove that I had never felt before: the feeling of giving everything for nothing. Not for a lack of effort or willpower, but a lack of weapons and ambition. But in that same space, we opened our hearts for some kind of hope that wait for us in the darkness. It drove us just enough to not want to end it all.

Annu let haeself onto the floor in front of Boon, trying to comfort her with gentle pats of her shoulder.

"Linyu," thi beckoned me to sit.

"This time is full of evil," thi said, "All of us have been caught in an undercurrent of lies. Of mighty forces vying for the last bits of power left in the world. And people who would end and enslave countless lives in order to save themselves for one more day."

I silently agreed.

"There is one problem which binds all these things together."

I realized in an instant what she meant, and the disparate knowings that jumbled round in my head began to make sense.

"The obscura," I said.

Thi nodded. "There is another time, far beyond the time that we can see."

"A hundred lifetimes," I whispered.

"We cannot defeat our enemies in this time."

"But we can outlast them until the next."

I smirked with vigor at our words.

"But first," she interjected, "Let's get some rest. We'll be safe here for a while."

I took the spot at Laen's warm belly and he let out a satisfied "oo". Throughout the night, I thought about Pomri. Grieved at the fate that lie before her. But then I thought of my nather, and all the others in Ulukoma who were waiting for a sign of hope. I took Annu's words into my heart through the water of grief on my cheeks and in my eyes. And my lungs had never felt so full of life.

"The same one that looked after Laen, I presume. Does thi know where our boat is?" she asked nonchalantly.

"A man named Ramne took it. But-"

The mystery was enough to pull her attention away from the ocean for a moment and look at me in disbelief.

"A man? There was someone else out here?"

"Thi has a huge gash on hae abdomen. Thi needs disinfectant and a bicarb tonic."

"And we need a boat."

"Are you listening to yourself?" I said, incredulous. "A maman is on the verge of death and you're raving about a boat."

"How do you think we'll be able to help hae without one?"

"You could start by giving hae some hope."

She looked at me as if to see me for the first time.

"You remember what I said on that crater. Nobody here will survive. As much as we want to help them, it's a lost cause."

"And you would abandon someone to make sure you're right?"

"To make sure you and I survive? I absolutely would. A maman on hae deathbed is dead weight."
