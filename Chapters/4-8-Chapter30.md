# Chapter 30

He picked a ziyu far enough way that climbing wouldn't alert anyone, but close enough that moving across the canopy wouldn't be difficult. From his sleeves, he produced two short kelp straps and signalled for me to climb first. I obliged. I went at my usual quick pace up the tree, and upon reaching the canopy, I plotted a path along the thick branches to reach an area above the pavilion. If I moved quickly, I could alert someone about Ramne.

Being in the canopy again gave me a pang of familiarity that I didn't quite understand. I looked to the red stars for some shred of memory. Kipnu's face came to mind: a glimpse of something obscured from my memory. But as Ramne caught up with me, I had no more time to remember. Annu needed me now.

With quick feet, I deftly hopped from branch to branch, careful not to slip on a patch of frost or lose my balance on a shaky branch. When I was nearly above the fire, I peered down, looking for any sign of people. A few paces from the fire I could see three figures, one of them sitting with hands bound and a woman standing over hae: Annu and Setre. There was a woman standing next to Setre with a wide metal shield. She struck some vague familiar chord within my thoughts, though I couldn't place where I knew her from.

Below me, I spotted Laen and Boon, munching on some morsel of food with their legs tied to a tree. I inhaled deeply to yell out to them, but a hand covered my mouth and nose before I could finish. I tried to scream but no air would move under the pressure of his hands.

"Now, now. Don't you go telling on me."

He moved my head to face him.

"This is our little secret."

Ramne rested on a branch immediately next to me and looked below. Near the larger fire was a stack of straw cushions that the injured had used to rest their heads. But nobody remained. Some might have been fishing, but there should have been at least some people building. I felt a strong sense of unease.

"There's no time for this," said Annu, "Ramne is here. He will kill us all!"

Ramne chuckled quietly. "The kaln has some sense," he whispered.

Setre snapped at Annu impatiently, "Shut it!"

"I know it's hard to believe but it must be true! I saw a boat moored here. It was the same one he left the mainland on."

"You sat and watched while he burned this place to the ground. Casra and Kipnu might have survived if you had warned us. But you betrayed your trustworthiness long ago when you banded with him."

The third person intervened. A woman's voice, bold and sweet. Like Rudjanese bread. "Setre, what if thi's telling the truth? Ramne could ruin everything we've built."

"This is fearmongering, Fanla. To make us easy targets. Look," she pointed to hae eyes, dimly blue in the darkness. It reminded me that thi was still vulnerable to death. "Thi is an addict. Ginnu was sent here to take all the kanosin Ramne couldn't carry from the fire."

"And what of your kaln? Thi brought hae here safe and sound."

"A token of false trust to bring our guard down."

"Do you hear yourself right now?"

Setre was taken aback. I glanced at Ramne who had a satisfied grin on his face.

"Oh I love this," he whispered with an almost giddy tone. "She doesn't know when to stop."

Setre reached for her spear and Fanla held her arm up. 

"Don't," said Fanla. She took a step. "If you hurt hae, you threaten the very trust that binds this place together."

"The wicked deserve punishment."

"And who are you to separate the wicked from the pure?"

Setre shook off Fanla's hand and pulled the spear from her back.

Fanla stood between them and repeated, "Don't do it!"

I looked again at Ramne, who was now looking at me with an eager smile. Before me, he held a polished metal ball in his hand, bisected, with something inside attaching the two together.

"You want to save hae, don't you?" he asked.

I nodded apprehensively.

"Then you you know what you have to do."

He placed the ball into my hand; its weight surprised me. Inside of it was some kind of fluid but I couldn't tell what kind. I had no doubts that such a thing was designed to kill somehow. In his other hand, he brandished the dagger, making sure I knew what would happen to me if I disobeyed. I looked below and saw only silence, hesitation amongst the three. The sound of my own belabored breath hung in my mind as I struggled with the choice I had been given.

She raised the spear and I raised my arm, and as the ball left my fingers I felt a deep pain in my chest. The ball spun through the air, tumbling and falling toward its target; I had to turn away. A metallic sound rang out and a large explosion folded the air on itself and knocked me back, landing me on a flimsy branch that arched under my body weight. I grasped for it to stop myself from falling but my grip wasn't firm enough and I only managed to slow myself down. At the end of the branch I finally caught a small tuft of twig and leaf and swung from it back toward the tree's trunk.

A voice called out toward me, but the blast had caused a ringing in my ears that made everything sound like a hum. I looked up to find Ramne, but he had disappeared from his spot in the tree. I looked below and saw a slow stream of blood running down my body from my chest.

"-inyu?!" I heard my name, followed by more hums of muffled speech. Two voices echoed in my head as I struggled to stay awake and keep a grip on the branch. I felt the branch stutter under my weight, slowly fracturing with the sway of my body. With a loud *snap* the branch finally broke, upending my sense of direction as I fell for what seemed like several moments compressed and molded to fit into the space of one. A dark figure appeared below me as I was about to land: large and quick. As my body pressed into it, I felt its softness, then its warmth as it moved with me as if to soften the blow. Then as if to rouse me awake, it made a soft humming sound that vibrated through my body.

I heard my name called again by muffled speech, and saw the two figures crowd around me. Deft hands raced across my body, jostling different parts of me left and right, up and down. I felt a finger slide under my coat and catch the wound on my chest. I winced in pain and soon after the fastenings of my coat were undone and a blue light shined above me, showing Setre's face.

"An- Gin-..." hae name turned over in my mind and upon my tongue. Fanla pulled out a flask of water and poured some on the wound. It stung for a moment but then resolved. I opened my eyes to see Setre, Laen, and Boon crowded around me.

"Where is Annu?"

Fanla and Setre paused, puzzled at the question, but Boon raised her head to look in a specific direction and let out two "woop" sounds. A silhouette with soft blue eyes slowly appeared behind Setre, still bound with a rope leading to Setre. Thi was safe for now.

Setre leaned in close and asked me loud enough to hear, "Who did this?"

I responded with the name she least wanted to hear. 

"Ramne."

She instinctively turned her head to Annu but I gently pulled her hand to bring her closer.

I said to her sternly, "I'll never forget what you almost did," and sank back down to wait for the ringing in my ears to pass. Fanla took me in her arms and moved me toward the dying fire as Setre stood in the dark, spanning the distance of her unrest, keeping an eye on Annu as thi hesitantly joined Fanla and me.

A crowd slowly began to form, the laborers returning from their work, alarmed at the sound of an explosion. They huddled around Setre, asking questions and fearing for their lives at each answer. Annu sat near Fanla as she massaged my neck to relieve the ringing sound. Thi stared blankly into the darkness.

"You're looking for him," I said to hae. Fanla was startled by the volume of my voice.

"Listening," thi said loudly back to me. "I cannot see."

Fanla chimed in, "Ramne won't be back with this many people. He only strikes when he sees an opportunity."

"How do you know?" I asked.

"All of the ruin you see around you was caused by him. The smoke that slipped you into the great darkness - that was caused by him. Nobody knew how it had started until long after it had ravaged this place."

I told them, "He coerced me because I was alone."

"Then it's best the three of us stick together from now on," she said. 

Fanla stopped massaging and shook her hand to loosen it up. I motioned for her to stop when she tried to go back to my neck.

"It's fine. I'm fine," I said, sitting up. She moved her hands to her trousers, dusting off some invisible debris before placing them together on her lap. But before she could settle in, a clamor of people erupted into the camp as blue lights flailed about and small explosions crackled through the trees. The three of us leapt to our feet as the explosions grew closer and closer.

"Holragi!" the guardians yelled. "Holragi!"

Setre flung herself toward the commotion and found some cover behind a big ziyu. She covered the light at her chest and arms with her poncho, and stooped low to stay hidden. I saw Fanla start to follow her but she stopped abruptly, seeing something moving in the distance. Immediately, she turned around and signalled for us to run.

I yelled to Annu, "It's time."

Thi nodded and bellowed to the crowd "To Ulu! Run to Ulu!"

Fanla and I bolted off into the crowd, yelling "To Ulu!" to all who we could find. Some of the Heikoi were packing food into bags, clutching their children close. 

"No time!" said Fanla, "Run!"

She motioned for me to follow, but I couldn't. My bond to my nather kept me frozen and planted. 

"I'll look after Setre!" she said. "Go!"

The first of the Holragi made it into the clearing, and the guardians who had fled before were now attacking from all sides. Explosions and shouts littered the cold air and I was certain Setre was amidst that cacophony. But I knew that I would be more trouble than help. I knew that it was best not to be by her side. So I turned. And I ran.

*"Tova'na to re-entry"*

Far ahead, Annu was running slowly with hae arms held out, tripping on the various traps the forest had set. I sped to hae side and picked hae up on my back.

"It's me" I said, "I'll get you there."

"I can't. I can't do it."

I slowed my walk to listen.

"We can still make it before the Holragi!"

"No, no," thi sobbed deeply into my shoulder. "Everyone... I'm sending them all to die."

I paused my speech to take in her meaning, still running toward the shore. It was something I knew but had never acknowledged. Annu's responsibility encompassed the future of our species. Every one of us would die here. This was an end. The people that inhabit our bodies in a hundred lifetimes may forget about everything they used to be. They would move along the path of time unaware of the memories we used to share, the places we used to dwell, the people we used to love. Or perhaps we *would* remember, and continue our quarrels until we wiped each other out again.

But this was not question of memory or of self or even of right or wrong. This was a gamble for the future of our species; for our collective knowledge, our ways of life; for any recollection that any of our lives were meaningful. If just one person rose with those memories, then all of our struggles would have been worth it.

We came to a clearing in the darkness where thousands of figures with illuminated hands and feet dotted the beach. The warm sand filled in the crevasses between my toes and a wave of comfort came over me. I lowered Annu to the ground, and wrapped hae in my arms. Hae breathing was heavy and thi was shivering from something far deeper than the cold. I was horrified to see that such an invisible pain.

From the forest came Laen and Boon, sniffing around for me. They saw a shaken Annu on the ground, and nuzzled hae with their wet noses to wake hae up, but still thi couldn't stop.

I did not yell at hae or lose my temper, but I held hae hand as thi held it even tighter, and the tremors began to subside. I sat hae up on a ridge of sand and placed my weight on hae, holding hae closely and speaking into hae ear.

"Annu," I said with a heavy heart, "I know that this is hard. An enormous burden has been placed upon you."

"There is... a feeling," thi stammered, "A terrible feeling. That a deep pit of regret could be lurking around the corner."

I took hae cheek in my hands and spoke as hae eyes struggled to stay open.

"Regret hides behind every corner. But still we turn to carry on."

Thi slowed hae crying and looked squarely into my eyes. Hae face was full of fear.

"Melna entrusted her spirit to you. And now I do the same. Wholly. Firmly. If you've lost faith in yourself, then borrow our faith in you."

A broken smile showed just for a moment, calming the storm of shivers that crackled through hae body,

"Help us, Annu."

Thi stared at me with those same gentle eyes; hae soul was crushed but hae spirit, boundless. It was in that moment that I felt the sacred permeate, that most precious of ethers that binds us all to each other. My mind unlocked the future, and a flood of a thousand souls flowed out from the sea and into the spaces between us. I felt a presence in Annu that could only be understood as a reflection of myself.

"I knew there was something special about you," thi said, "Melna lives on inside you."

Hae hand traced my cheek until it held my neck gently in its calloused ridges.

"Gather up the bluekelp. A half handful for each."

I spared no pause to repeat hae words, and neither did anyone who heard. Straight away, the kelpers and the fishers jumped into the water to find sharp rocks and harvest. The others stayed behind to find large flat rocks to build a sort of shallow vessel in the ground. They made quick work of each task: a pile of short kelp squares appeared in mere moments. Annu had found some strength to stand, and asked Fanla guide hae way to me.

"Say a few words, and then I'll tell them," thi said, and I nodded to hae in agreement.

I gathered those around me and mustered up enough mental fortitude to speak to them. But I knew how precious our time was, and I began before I was ready. 

"As you know, the Holragi have cornered us into this beach and we're out of options. I had hoped we could have some time to discuss this, but this is our last and only option. What we're asking you to do today will take incredible courage and indominitable will from each and every one of you."

I took a moment to see each one of them for who they were, that they would be remembered if only for a moment. It was the children that brought the hint of tears. Some barely a na'tova younger than myself. Many without parents. For every ray of illumination that landed upon them, a bead of water, a furrowed brow, a subtle tremble. They wore their fear like a uniform. They looked to me as their captain.

"Each of you will get a small square of kelp. Chew it, swallow the liquid, and spit out the rest. Then..."

Thi took a deep sigh, looking to the crowd.

"...We swim... Far far away... Where Holrag can never find us."

They seemed confused by this cryptic answer. 

"Where do we go?" asked a boy, nearly my age.

"Toward Ulu."

"There's nothing but ice out there," he said.

There was no response from hae, but a steady gaze toward the darkness. I glanced and saw tears in the shallows of hae eyes, and knew that thi couldn't say it. Nothing of truth or fallacy would satisfy a life that longs to continue but can't.

I spoke for hae, "We will live on the ice. The Holragi would never dare go further than this point."

Annu couldn't look me in the eye, but gave my chest a nod of approval and gratitude.

"Let's begin," I called. "Form two lines and move quickly!"

The crowd did not form two lines, and instead nearly trampled each other, but Fanla saw this coming and kept the weaker and smaller ones protected. I grabbed a few squares each for Laen and Boon and held tightly to a corner as they chewed away on the rest. As I went back to the pile to get one for myself, a familiar hand caught my eye as it reached out toward the pile.

"I'll be right back," I said to Annu.

"Wait, where-," thi objected, but I was gone before thi could stop me.

I found Fanla maintaining a line near the crowd.

"Keep an eye on me," I asked her.

The crowd was densely packed, full of people bobbing left and right to see the rest of the line. But I knew who I was looking for. I reached the end then doubled back on the other side of the lines, certain that I would find him, but his face did not appear. Then I heard Annu scream, and a raucous of confused voices. Fanla and I rushed toward the noise from different sides. No one had stopped their rush for bluekelp save for a Heikoan girl who waved at us to approach.

"A man took Annu into the forest," she said. Fanla took off into the forest, but the girl asked me, "what's he gonna do?"

"Don't worry, we'll track them down," I said. "Just make sure to get your kelp."

She held out her square proudly, and I smiled before sending her off and running into the forest after Fanla.

The sound of metal clanging on metal rang in the chilly air, mingled with the smell of sparks. I caught up to Fanla who was staring into the darkness with a firm wooden staff in hand. 

She held me back. "It's too dangerous. Wait until they stop."

As my eyes began to adjust, I could see their figures in the light of Fanla's outstretched hands. We waited for an opening, a distance just long enough for us to hold Ramne back and disarm him, but every time Annu would move backward Ramne would close the distance in the blink of an eye.

"You are a scourge on humanity!" yelled Ramne, "An affront to life! And now you'll finally die!" 

He wailed on hae but thi caught every blow and jab he tried. Annu caught his dagger in the hook of hae own and flung them both into the snow.

"Go!" Annu said to us, "Get out of here before the Holragi find you!"

In the distance, the explosions grew closer, but I knew this was the opening we had been waiting for. I ran toward them, but Fanla quickly pulled me back.

"No! Annu!" I screamed. "Annu!"

As much as I screamed and pried at her arms, Fanla would not stop. She had a duty to protect the sanctity of life, and the power to weigh its value.

The darkness swallowed their battle and all its sounds mixed with the percussion of an advancing Holragi army.
