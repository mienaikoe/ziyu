# Chapter 30

He picked a vantage point in a ziyu above the new pavilion. He pulled some short kelp straps from his sleeves and signalled for me to climb first. I was much faster than him.

Being there gave me a pang of familiarity that I didn't quite understand. I looked to the red stars for some shred of memory. Kipnu's face came to mind: a glimpse of something obscured from my memory. But as Ramne caught up with me, I had no more time to remember. Annu and Liffa needed me now.

Ramne pointed down at the pavilion for me to observe. Near the larger fire was Setre, standing where the injured had been. All of them were now elsewhere now, leaving a stack of straw cushions they had used to rest their heads, now neatly arranged save for one. Upon it was Annu, bound and sitting before Setre.

"There's no time for this," said Annu, "Ramne knows this place. He will kill us all. We have to hide!"

Ramne chuckled quietly. "That kaln doesn't know a thing," he said.

Setre was impatient. "Shut up!" she said, "Ramne isn't here!"

"He is! We saw the boat!"

Setre shoved Annu forward until thi stumbled onto the ground, knealt down to speak into hae ear. I felt angry, but not shocked. The expectation I felt toward my nather's actions disturbed me.

"And why would I trust his own spy?"

"What?" Thi replied fearfully, hae voice muffled by dirt and leaves.

"I know what you're up to, Ginnu."

<!--
What comes next:
- Setre shows Annu to the others. Makes a fool of hae, says thi is responsible for hae actions, and foments lots of rage against hae for Ramne's actions of getting them addicted.
- Linyu gets captured by Ramne and is forced to hide in the shadows with him as he tries to convince Linyu that Setre is evil. "The only way to save hae is to kill Setre"
- Linyu agrees, and takes a dagger. But has tricked Ramne, and saves Annu without killing Setre.

OR

- Ramne and Linyu go to the Guardians. Ramne sets a trap to capture them all.
