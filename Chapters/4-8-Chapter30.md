# Chapter 30

He picked a ziyu far enough way that climbing wouldn't alert anyone, but close enough that moving across the canopy wouldn't be difficult. From his sleeves, he produced two short kelp straps and signalled for me to climb first. I obliged. I went at my usual quick pace up the tree, and upon reaching the canopy, I plotted a path along the thick branches to reach an area above the pavilion. If I moved quickly, I could alert someone about Ramne.

Being in the canopy again gave me a pang of familiarity that I didn't quite understand. I looked to the red stars for some shred of memory. Kipnu's face came to mind: a glimpse of something obscured from my memory. But as Ramne caught up with me, I had no more time to remember. Annu needed me now.

With quick feet, I deftly hopped from branch to branch, careful not to slip on a patch of frost or lose my balance on a shaky branch. When I was nearly above the fire, I peered down, looking for any sign of people. A few paces from the fire I could see three figures, one of them sitting with hands bound and a woman standing over hae: Annu and Setre. There was a woman standing next to Setre with a wide metal shield. She struck some vague familiar chord within my thoughts, though I couldn't place where I knew her from.

Below me, I spotted Laen and Boon, munching on some morsel of food with their legs tied to a tree. I inhaled deeply to yell out to them, but a hand covered my mouth and nose before I could finish. I tried to scream but no air would move under the pressure of his hands.

"Now, now. Don't you go telling on me."

He moved my head to face him.

"This is our little secret."

Ramne rested on a branch immediately next to me and looked below. Near the larger fire was a stack of straw cushions that the injured had used to rest their heads. But nobody remained. Some might have been fishing, but there should have been at least some people building. I felt a strong sense of unease.

"There's no time for this," said Annu, "Ramne is here. He will kill us all!"

Ramne chuckled quietly. "The kaln has some sense," he whispered.

Setre snapped at Annu impatiently, "Shut it!"

"I know it's hard to believe but it must be true! I saw a boat moored here. It was the same one he left the mainland on."

"You sat and watched while he burned this place to the ground. Casra and Kipnu might have survived if you had warned us. But you betrayed your trustworthiness long ago when you banded with him."

The third person intervened. A woman's voice, bold and sweet. Like Rudjanese bread. "Setre, what if thi's telling the truth? Ramne could ruin everything we've built."

"This is fearmongering, Fanla. To make us easy targets. Look," she pointed to hae eyes, dimly blue in the darkness. It reminded me that thi was still vulnerable to death. "Thi is an addict. Ginnu was sent here to take all the kanosin Ramne couldn't carry from the fire."

"And what of your kaln? Thi brought hae here safe and sound."

"A token of false trust to bring our guard down."

"Do you hear yourself right now?"

Setre was taken aback. I glanced at Ramne who had a satisfied grin on his face.

"Oh I love this," he whispered with an almost giddy tone. "She doesn't know when to stop."

Setre reached for her spear and Fanla held her arm up. 

"Don't," said Fanla. She took a step. "If you hurt hae, you threaten the very trust that binds this place together."

"The wicked deserve punishment."

"And who are you to separate the wicked from the pure?"

Setre shook off Fanla's hand and pulled the spear from her back.

Fanla stood between them and repeated, "Don't do it!"

I looked again at Ramne, who was now looking at me with an eager smile. Before me, he held a polished metal ball in his hand, bisected, with something inside attaching the two together.

"You want to save hae, don't you?" he asked.

I nodded apprehensively.

"Then you you know what you have to do."

He placed the ball into my hand; its weight surprised me. Inside of it was some kind of fluid but I couldn't tell what kind. I had no doubts that such a thing was designed to kill somehow. In his other hand, he brandished the dagger, making sure I knew what would happen to me if I disobeyed. I looked below and saw only silence, hesitation amongst the three. The sound of my own belabored breath hung in my mind as I struggled with the choice I had been given.

She raised the spear and I raised my arm, and as the ball left my fingers I felt a deep pain in my chest. The ball spun through the air, tumbling and falling toward its target; I had to turn away. A metallic sound rang out and a large explosion folded the air on itself and knocked me back, landing me on a flimsy branch that arched under my body weight. I grasped for it to stop myself from falling but my grip wasn't firm enough and I only managed to slow myself down. At the end of the branch I finally caught a small tuft of twig and leaf and swung from it back toward the tree's trunk.

A voice called out toward me, but the blast had caused a ringing in my ears that made everything sound like a hum. I looked up to find Ramne, but he had disappeared from his spot in the tree. I looked below and saw a slow stream of blood running down my body from my chest.

"-inyu?!" I heard my name, followed by more hums of muffled speech. Two voices echoed in my head as I struggled to stay awake and keep a grip on the branch. I felt the branch stutter under my weight, slowly fracturing with the sway of my body. With a loud *snap* the branch finally broke, upending my sense of direction as I fell for what seemed like several moments compressed and molded to fit into the space of one. A dark figure appeared below me as I was about to land: large and quick. As my body pressed into it, I felt its softness, then its warmth as it moved with me as if to soften the blow. Then as if to rouse me awake, it made a soft humming sound that vibrated through my body.

I heard my name called again by muffled speech, and saw the two figures crowd around me. Deft hands raced across my body, jostling different parts of me left and right, up and down. I felt a finger slide under my coat and catch the wound on my chest. I winced in pain and soon after the fastenings of my coat were undone and a blue light shined above me, showing Setre's face.

"An- Gin-..." hae name turned over in my mind and upon my tongue. Fanla pulled out a flask of water and poured some on the wound. It stung for a moment but then resolved. I opened my eyes to see Setre, Laen, and Boon crowded around me.

"Where is Annu?"

Fanla and Setre paused, puzzled at the question, but Boon raised her head to look in a specific direction and let out two "woop" sounds. A silhouette with soft blue eyes slowly appeared behind Setre, still bound with a rope leading to Setre. Thi was safe for now.

Setre leaned in close and asked me loud enough to hear, "Who did this?"

I responded with the name she least wanted to hear. 

"Ramne."

She instinctively turned her head to Annu but I gently pulled her hand to divert her attention.

I said to her sternly, "I'll never forget what you almost did," then sank back down to ride out the waves of pain.

A crowd began to form. Fishers and builders returning from their work.
