# Chapter 30

He picked a ziyu far enough way that climbing wouldn't alert anyone, but close enough that moving across the canopy wouldn't be difficult. From his sleeves, he produced two short kelp straps and signalled for me to climb first. I obliged. I went at my usual quick pace up the tree, and upon reaching the canopy, I plotted a path along the thick branches to reach an area above the pavilion. If I moved quickly, I could alert someone about Ramne.

Being in the canopy again gave me a pang of familiarity that I didn't quite understand. I looked to the red stars for some shred of memory. Kipnu's face came to mind: a glimpse of something obscured from my memory. But as Ramne caught up with me, I had no more time to remember. Annu needed me now.

With quick feet, I deftly hopped from branch to branch, careful not to slip on a patch of frost or lose my balance on a shaky branch. When I was nearly above the fire, I peered down, looking for any sign of a person, but I saw none. In the darkness a little ways out I could see three figures, one of them sitting. It was Annu, bound with Setre and another person I didn't know. I inhaled deeply to yell out, but a hand covered my mouth and nose before I could finish. I tried to scream but no air would move under the pressure of his hands.

"Now, now. Don't you go telling on me."

He moved my head to face him.

"This is our little secret."

Ramne rested on a branch immediately next to me and looked around. Near the larger fire was a stack of straw cushions that the injured had used to rest their heads. But nobody remained. Some might have been fishing, but there should have been at least some people building. I felt a strong sense of unease.

"There's no time for this," said Annu, "Ramne is here. He will kill us all. We have to hide!"

Ramne chuckled quietly. "The kaln has some sense," he whispered.

Setre was impatient. "Shut it!" she snapped.

"He is! We saw the boat!"

"And why would I trust his own spy?"

The third person intervened. A woman's voice, bold and sweet as Rudjanese bread. "Setre, what if thi's telling the truth? Ramne could ruin everything we've built."

"This is fearmongering, Fanla. To soften us up so thi can loot this place. Look," she pointed to hae eyes, dimly blue in the darkness. I couldn't be sure if thi had enough to escape death again. "Thi is an addict. Ginnu was sent here to take all the kanosin Ramne couldn't carry from the fire."

"And what of your kaln? Thi brought hae here too, didn't thi?"

"A token of false trust to bring our guard down."

"Do you hear yourself right now?"

Setre was taken aback. I glanced at Ramne who had a satisfied grin on his face.

"Oh I love this," he whispered with an almost giddy tone. "Your nather doesn't know when to stop."

Setre reached for her spear and Fanla held her arm up. 

"Don't," said Fanla. She took a step. "If you hurt hae, you threaten the very trust that binds this place together. Anyone could be put to death. And some may not come back."

"The wicked deserve no lesser punishment."

"And who are you to separate the wicked from the pure?"

Setre pulled her spear from her back.

Fanla repeated, "Don't do it!"

I looked again at Ramne, who was now looking at me with a wide smile and a round, polished stone in his hand.

"You want to save hae, don't you?"

I nodded apprehensively.

"Then you you know what you have to do. Kill her."

He placed the rock into my hand; its weight, my soul took on. I now had to choose between my nather and the pure-hearted maman that saved my life.



<!--
What comes next:

- Setre shows Annu to the others. Makes a fool of hae, says thi is responsible for hae actions, and foments lots of rage against hae for Ramne's actions of getting them addicted.
- Linyu gets captured by Ramne and is forced to hide in the shadows with him as he tries to convince Linyu that Setre is evil. "The only way to save hae is to kill Setre"
- Linyu agrees, and takes a dagger. But has tricked Ramne, and saves Annu without killing Setre.

OR

- Ramne and Linyu go to the Guardians. Ramne sets a trap to capture them all.
