## Interlogue

Jathi looked over my shoulder toward the gray mountains of Seroa while my eyes were fixed upon the rays of Ara peeking through the shades of our train car. I was thankful for his warmth here, near the end of our journey to Holrag.

"What are you thinking about?" he asked.

I humored him. "To be honest, cake." He kept staring at the mountains, unmoved by my silly answer. Perhaps he had planted the question. "What about you?" I asked.

"Do you ever wonder what drove them to live up there?"

"Who?" I asked.

"The Seroai," he replied. "I've never met one; only heard one speak on the conduit a few times. But that was just observer talk."

"It was the war," I explained. "The armies of Holrag couldn't climb and fight at the same time. The Seroai knew it was safer up there."

"But that was so long ago. They could have built walls with all those rocks they're sitting on if they were really that paranoid. They could have had an easy life in the valleys like the Chistai, but instead they're locked away in those huge keeps. What do they even eat?"

"Birds," said Fajro. He was sitting far from us, in his own area with his leg propped up on the seat next to him. "And fish for the lords," he continued. "But mostly birds." Jathi gave him a disgusted look, but Fajro seemed amused more than anything.

He looked at me and said, "And you... You've got it all backward. Seroa and Chista used to be one big lawless province full of thieves and beggars. Travelers used to come from far and wide for promises of easy work in these lush valleys. Then when they'd done their time and made their way back, a pack of these would come off the mountain and rob them blind. Those fortresses you see up there were for spotting travelers on their way back to Holrag. It was k'aal, what they were doing."

Jathi looked back at the mountains again with a stern look on his face, changing his judgment of the Seroai from hermit fiefdom to selfish bandits. I was beginning to wonder if I'd made the right choice in bringing him as I resumed my look out the window, sending my scattered thoughts to the star I would soon share a home with.

"What do you make of Kipnu?" Jathi asked me, his voice now tender and longing. "You think he'll be ok out there in the dark?"

"I don't know," I said.

"An island full of people running around in the dark all day. A place like that, you'd do anything to feel safe for a moment."

A pang of anguish pursed my lungs. "He chose his path. And so did I. I'm not going to waste the time we have left worrying if I've made the right decision when I can work on making it right."

He looked at me intently, realizing the effect his words had had on me, and sighed. "Kipnu may not understand it now, but he will someday. I've seen the fire you bring out in each other. You'll both get through this."

"Thank you, Jathi."
