## Interlogue

Jathi looked over my shoulder toward the gray mountains of Seroa while my eyes were fixed upon the rays of Ara peeking through the shades of our train car. I was thankful for his warmth here, near the end of our journey to Holrag.

"Do you ever wonder what drove them to live up there?" he asked me.

"Who?" I asked.

"The Seroai," he replied. "I've never met one. Only heard one speak on the conduit a few times. But that was just observer talk."

"It was the war," I said. "When the Holragi tried to invade this place."

"They could have built walls with all those rocks they're sitting on. They could have chosen the lush valleys like the Chistai,."

Fajro was sitting far from us, in his own area with his leg propped up on the seat next to him.

I didn't stir. "
