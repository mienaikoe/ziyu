<!-- 
I lied.

The obscura was not closer to Ara. Fajro's physicists had been correct when they sent me to Ara Equilibrium.

I did not do it to save myself. In fact, had I known there were barrels full of explosives right behind me, I still would have taken the blow to save my planet, but for the obscura itself. In a manner speaking, I had been caught, but that would be too imprecise an expression. That I had been captivated would bring more honor to the truth, for I had known what the obscura was for far longer than Holragi had known. Two days to be exact. And I couldn't let it be destroyed. -->
