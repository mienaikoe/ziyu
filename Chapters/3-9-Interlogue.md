*Log 31 - 2:4:0:5*


"So. I guess I should deliver my report then."

A few breaths to calm haeself.

"It's been two daysâ€“"

Thi choked back a tear and listened to the stale echo of hae voice in the cabin.

"Two days, four va'la... since launch."

"This is my *last* first ... first log since radio silence at apogee. I passed through the obscura unscathed. Whether this was an intentional gesture or, *heh*, just dumb luck, I... I don't know."

"Of course, you know by now, that the obscura is surrounding all of Ara like a shell. Not just our own corner of the sky."

"When I look out the window, All I see is light. I can't look for very long. It's so bright." 

"I had to walk against the walls to orient the window away from Ara. But the obscura is still... it's everywhere I can see and incredibly bright. Shining a bright pale red-infrared."

"It's beautiful in a way... In it's own way. I never knew something so destructive could evoke such beauty. I'm not sure those little things understand what beauty is. I don't imagine they care."

Thi paused and exhaled as if drinking something.

"The obscura... are... I don't know of a good way to describe them other than... thin rocks with hundreds of tiny...things inhabiting them. I only got a glimpse of one as I passed by, but the little ones are somewhere from the size of a pebble to the size of my hand. I can't imagine how many of them there are interspersed throughout the rocks. Must be trillions. What they're all here for, I'm not sure. I'm not a scientist, but I would guess they're using Ara for something."

A sigh and a sniffle rattled the air as thi wiped a tear from hae face.

"Whoever is listening to this, I want the world to know that I wasn't afraid." 

"My nather always told me. To befriend my fear, so it doesn't betray me in my ignorance. I know that I should be afraid, ordinarily, but perhaps... I've had a long time to accept that this would happen."

"We were just regular people. We got swept up in the chaos of it all. Kipnu, Melna, and me. I could say that we didn't deserve to die, and by most accounts I'd be justified in saying so. But it does no good to speak of who deserves what. We chose to stick our heads where others buried theirs in fear. I'll never know if our efforts mattered, but I'm satisfied knowing that our convictions pay no mind either way."

"...Well," thi bridged the silence, but couldn't think of anything else to say.

"It's getting rather hot up here. Think I ought to go to spare you the details."

"Linyu, tell your mom I'm thankful for all that thi's done."
