_Log 31 - 2:4:0:5_

<!-- "So. I guess I should deliver my report then." -->

The light of the end hung above, ever growing, ever imminent.

This was surely the end.

A few breaths to calm haeself, then thi turned a knob and a brass tumbler near hae head began rotating from beneath a glass window. Thi flipped a switch labelled "etch" and a small needle began making markings in the tumbler.

"I don't know if you can hear me down there but I'm still alive."

"It's been two–"

Thi choked back a tear and listened to the stale echo of hae voice in the cabin.

"Two days... and Four va'la... since launch."

"This is my first" _last_ "... first log since radio silence. I passed through the obscura unscathed. Whether this was an intentional gesture or just dumb luck, I... I don't know."

"Of course, you know by now, that the obscura is surrounding all of Ara like a shell. Not just our own corner of the sky. Even if we could blast away the portion nearest us, something else would come to fill it up. We never stood a chance."

With a sniffle, thi adjusted haeself in the craft.

"When I look out the window, All I see is light. I can't look for very long. It's so bright."

"I had to walk against the walls to orient the window away from Ara. But the obscura is still... it's everywhere I can see and incredibly bright. Shining a bright pale red-infrared."

"It's beautiful in a way... In it's own way. I never knew something so destructive could evoke such beauty. I'm not sure those little things understand what beauty is. I don't imagine they care."

Thi paused and exhaled as if drinking something.

"The obscura... are... I don't know of a good way to describe them other than... thin rocks with hundreds of tiny...things inhabiting them. I only got a glimpse of one as I passed by, but the little ones are somewhere from the size of a pebble to the size of my hand. I can't imagine how many of them there are interspersed throughout the rocks. Must be trillions. What they're all here for, I'm not sure. I'm not a scientist, but I would guess they're using Ara for something."

A sigh and a sniffle rattled the air as thi wiped a tear from hae face.

"Whoever is listening to this... I want you to know that I'm not afraid of what comes next."

"My nather taught me to befriend my fear, so it doesn't betray me in my ignorance. But this time there's none to find. I know that I should be afraid. It's strange that I'm not. But I've had a long time to accept that this would happen. Only a fool would hope to be a hero for free."

A high-pitched ringing sound snuck into the sound field. Hae binding pendant.

"We were just regular people... We got swept up in the chaos of it all. Kipnu and Melna and me. I could say that we didn't deserve to die, and by most accounts I'd be justified in saying so. But it does no good to speak of who deserves what. We chose to stick our heads where others buried theirs in fear. I'll never know if our efforts mattered, but I'm satisfied knowing that our convictions couldn't give a damn."

"...Well," thi bridged the silence, but nothing else came to hae.

"It's getting rather hot up here. Think I'll spare you the details."

"Linyu, if you're listening to this somehow. Thank y–" _click_
