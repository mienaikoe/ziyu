  "Ramne. Who is Ramne?"

  "I've heard of him," Pomri chimed in. "He used to be some nobody in the Rudjan guard who thought he was smarter than the rest of us. Never got promoted, so he just left us one day without a trace."


  Linyu whimpered in fear at his name, drawing Pomri's attention.

  "Eh? What's gotten into you?" she asked.

  Thi was getting ready to jump off of Laen-Laen and run, but Melna had already become aware of hae and leapt back to hae.

  "Hey, Linyu. What's wrong?" asked Melna, holding onto hae arms.

  "Ramne," thi said in a cracked voice, "He..."

  Tears were forming at the corners of hae eyes.

  "What did he do?"

  "Mom," thi said, at the end of hae wit.




  "I take it you're not a boat person. Well, we can't go back now so you're either coming with us or you're on your own again."

  Thi took a moment, feeling angry at the predicament thi was put into. There was nowhere to run, standing outside a massive city barred from entry, and Laen-Laen, who could take hae anywhere if anywhere were safe anymore. Thi placed hae hand on Kip's pendant under hae shirt and closed hae eyes in thought.

  "Together," thi whispered. Pomri smiled at hae courage.

## Chapter 18

"The train here is shut down too," Pomri said with disappointment.

"Nevermind that I need to speak with Linyu," said Melna.

"What's gotten into you?" Pomri asked, suspicious.

Melna stooped to Linyu's level and gazed into hae firey blue eyes. She was sure that the woman had them too.

"Do you know a woman named Ginnu and a possibly her partner?" she asked.

Linyu was shocked, "H-How.."

"I need to know, Linyu. Please tell me. Who are they?"

"Kanosin"

"They sell kanosin?"

Thi nodded in confirmation.

"Did you know they are looking for you?"

Hae hands began to tremble and she grasped them in comfort.

"Why are they after you?"

Thi pointed to the listener in hae ear.

"Why is this thing so important? What does it do?"

Thi began to cry but held hae wits together while trying to find a way to explain.

Melna pressed for simpler answers. 

"is it a weapon, some new material?"

Thi took the listener off hae ear and gave it to Melna, who hesitantly put it up to her ear.

"I can hear strange static sounds. Where is it coming from?"

Linyu gestured all around, wishing thi had hae transmitter there.

Pomri interjected, "You're wasting your time with this nonsense."

"Wait. I can hear someone talking," she said, still listening intently. She tried to hear the words, but could only hear a few through the noise.

"What are they talking about?" she asked Linyu again.

But instead of an answer Linyu held hae hand up to hae ear, telling her to keep listening.

She listened closer and then heard an unmistakeable voice of the maman who woke up early to sit under a tree. Who dressed her before she went to Shaki and gave her a kiss on the forehead even when thi was unhappy with her.

"Liffa! You're alive!"
