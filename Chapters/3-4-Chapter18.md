  - Maybe Casra had fled to Casra's home (some convo they had or something)
  - They wouldn't know about Heiko destruction
- ELSE

She knew that something was amiss when she saw a group of citykeepers leafing through the crowd at the station, looking for someone specific. The members of this crowd did not seem particularly rushed as a normal intending passenger might be, but glanced around cautiously, as if worried that their deepest secrets might become the target of the keepers' inquisition.

She walked along the perimeter of the area, searching for Pomri and avoiding the keepers, but after a long while she discovered no sign of Pomri or Linyu. She found a young maman, asked hae if thi had seen a woman and child, but thi averted hae eyes and walked away.

_What happened here?_

From the corner of her eye, she spotted the eyes of a maman staring back at her. Thi wore a thin ashen gray coat and hae mouth and nose was covered with a thick black cloth that was almost certainly the same material that Linyu was wearing. Melna planned her next steps carefully, checking every corner and vantage point in the area, and all the while the maman's gaze did not move.

"You are looking for someone?" thi asked.

"Yes. A woman and a kaln. Have you seen them?"

"You have a pendant. Show me."

"My pendant? Whatever for?"

Thi remained silent, staring at her with the eyes of a maman who had long internalized the folly of trust.

Melna stood confidently and said, "I am Melna um Heiko. I am bound to Kipnu and Liffa and I don't need to show my most valued traditional heirloom to prove that to some thief. Now please tell me if you know where they've gone or I shall be on my-"

"Come with me," thi said interrupted her, and turned down the alleyway they stood in. Melna was exasperated. If not for her utter lack of any other leads, she would have turned around and left. But there was something about this maman; like the crucial piece of a puzzle, there was no way forward without her.

"First of all, who are you?" Melna asked as she caught up with hae.

"Who I am is not important," thi said, removing her mask. Though it was dark, Melna could see more of the features of hae face. Thi seemed younger than the age hae eyes would suggest, and her tone more clever than many of the fidelants she had worked with.

"Linyu and Pomri are safe," the maman explained. "They were walking into a trap at the station, but I removed them from the danger."

"I want to see them. Where are they now?"

"They've fled the city. They're going back to Heiko."

"What? No! Heiko is in grave danger."

Thi stopped walking and Melna stepped and turned to stand in front of hae.

"What do you mean?" thi asked.

"I overheard a man talking about Heiko. He said it would be a pile of rubble by morning."

"Even the greatest army in the world can't take a city in one night."

"Holragi doesn't need an army," Melna said. Her voice deadened the air. "We must go after them."

"I have a ship. Best in Rudjan."

Melna felt a sudden pang of suspicion.

"What's your angle in all this?" she asked.

"You will learn soon. But for now, it is too dangerous here. We must leave immediately."

"No. This is all too convenient to be coincidence. You tell me why you're helping me and how do you know Linyu?"

Thi sighed and spoke somberly. "I was once a pupil of Linyu's mother, Casra. Thi led a small company back in the early days after the seventh cold. Thi taught me nearly everything I know about how to lead people. Over time, it became clear that the kanosin had taken over and I was forced to take hae place. As chief, I took hae company to new heights and became very wealthy in the process, but I never got to thank hae for all that thi taught me."

Thi laughed softly at haeself. "I guess my gratitude is burning a hole in my heart, and this is my way of paying it."

Melna knew a lie when she saw one. But this one was peppered with truths that she couldn't decipher. She decided to follow this maman to see where thi would lead her, but knew to keep a safe distance.

"Before I go with you," she said, "I need to tend to my saffa. I'll be quick about it. Meet me at the harbor?"

"Melna, we must leave _now_."

"I'll be fine," she said confidently.

"Let me go with you. I know these streets well."

"That won't be necessary. I'll only be a moment."

The maman saw that she wouldn't be convinced so easily. Thi sighed and backed away, realizing how closely thi had leaned in to speak to her.

"My ship is at pier 5," thi said. "We have very little time to save them, Melna. Please be quick."

"I want to save Linyu as much as you do. It won't be long, I promise."

And with a quickness in hae step, the maman walked down the dark alley with hae eyes fixed upon Melna. There is no other displeasure quite like being the prey of another's eye. She felt it at Heiko station: How the two looked at her with a hungry gaze, eyeing her bag and her saffa. She felt it in Fajro's presence, his face barely hiding his lustful thoughts.

She walked back up the alley and stopped at the place where she'd encountered the maman. Her eyes peered down the wall of the station toward the skies above Heiko, and with her mind she reached out through the dusty path that Pomri and Linyu had traveled. _Pomri knows what she's doing_, she reassured to herself. Yet there was a looming dread hanging in her mind where her guilt nucleated and pervaded her thoughts. Perhaps a more clever leader could have seen these dangers earlier; could have persuaded the senate not to give Holrag such power; could have fought for Liffa to stay here. She stopped herself when small droplets leapt out of her flushed cheek.

"I will find you when this is over," she swore to them. "You will have a home to come back to. I promise."

She turned her eyes back toward Rudjan with all its patches of wooden buildings haphazardly placed amongst the watery foreground, and surrendered all of her worries in order to focus. _I need to keep a low profile until I'm gone._ She loosened her black shawl and raised it above her head to form a makeshift hood, and tightened it again around her neck. With a quick glance and a first step she headed back to the conduit to get some answers.

Her feet retraced her steps down the pathway toward the conduit building, recalling her run-in with the strange man, and that eerie look of malice in his eyes. Somehow that man knew that Heiko would be destroyed. Somehow the maman knew right where Pomri and Linyu would be, knew to wait for her. There was some sort of network of information that was right under her nose, and she was determined to get to the bottom of it.

"Aey?" she called, but there was no answer. At the operator desk sat a man, tall and exhausted, speaking quietly into the microphone. He glanced at her and quickly murmured something quiet into the microphone and then shuffled from the desk to approach her.

"You can't be here. Please leave."

"The conduit is a public utility."

"Rudjan conduit is closed under order from the senate."

She lowered her hood and said, "I am a fidelant of the senate. There is no such order."

"You leave now!" he yelled, realizing who she was. He ran over to her to push her toward the door, but Melna spun his hands off of her arm and moved further into the room behind the desk, holding her hand out to keep him away. Her other hand hovered over the switch for the conduit, stopping the man in his tracks.

She said, "You seem agitated. Do you have some things to tell the rest of us?"

"Step away from the desk!"

"Ooh so you _do_ know what's happening in Holrag. Maybe you know why they're planning to destroy Heiko. Should I tell the world what you're doing here?"

He didn't say a word, but held his apprehensive stance. Melna glanced at the space across the table, her hand still at the ready.

"Have a seat," she said. "I'd like to talk."

He looked around for help or dignity, both of which he had found himself in a great debt, then kicked a stool out from underneath the table and reluctantly sat down.

She began, "Have you ever been to Heiko, Å¾ah...?"

He didn't respond.

"Operator, then. Well, operator, what do you know about Heiko?"

"You hoard food and lie to the world. The Holragi told everone."

"Is that what the operators are saying on the conduit these days? Now tell me. What do you talk about in the more secretive channels."

He donned a fake smile and said, "I have no clue what you're talking about."

Melna was quickly becoming impatient with him. She moved from her spot and pivoted around the table with the microphone in hand, setting it down next to her.

He spoke between breaths with unwavering conviction, "You and your people. You're all criminals. Everybody knows it. You'll never succeed as long as Holrag is in power."

"A Holrag sympathizer, eh? Did they tell you about how their sociopath ex-fidelant kidnapped my jundmaman?"

"The blood of Holrag flows through Liffa's veins, far stronger than Heikoi blood. Only a true Holragi deserves to be a hero like hae."

She leaned forward and stared intensely into his eyes as he smirked back at her. With a quick movement, she lifted a small blade to his neck. He lifted his hands in response, but they were too slow: the blade had already fallen below his head and nestled right into a crevasse in his skin where any movement would surely be deadly.

"You know nothing about Liffa," she said.

He laughed menacingly in her face, "I imagine it will be a fitting end for a true Holragi, dying a hero after hae mission, a symbol of defiance against the Heikoi who indoctrinated hae."

"And what about you? Do you call yourself a hero? Coordinating the deaths of tens of thousands of people?"

"You are a scourge on the world. You deserve what's coming to you. You'll be crying under the rubble of what's left of Heiko before you can even say goodbye."

She maintained her scowl, her entire frontal lobe holding back from slamming his head against the table repeatedly until she felt better, but she knew this wasn't the time. She committed his words to the parts of her memory that were padded and padlocked and armored against the toughest truths, then simply lifted her foot from the switch of the microphone, making sure the operator saw her.

"Heiko is a warm place," she said quietly, "Full of beautiful places and generous people. But I want you to remember this. We know when we have been betrayed. We may suffer but we will rebuild. And those who rejoiced in our suffering will be the first to fall upon our blades."

She gathered herself, glancing again quickly at the mess of rails and wires that filled the upper half of the room and took a step toward the door as he lifted himself from the chair.

<!-- left off -->

When he had stood up, she turned her head and said, "You _will_ regret this day."

"I would quicker forget you," he chuckled quietly.

The floorboards creaked loudly under her feet as she quickly moved to the door and jolted it open it to leave, turning to take one last look at the operator and his room before closing the door behind her.

What he didn't know is that she had traced the rails of the conduit and discovered one that reached the ceiling but did not emerge from the roof. And in her pocket a new friend had made her a brand new device made specifically to listen to it. She held the coil up to her ear as she made her way through the crowds back to the gate where she had entered.

"It's Tunbe."

She could hear him as clearly as if he were standing right next to her.

"Heiko knows. We need to move fast."

A voice spoke in anger, "Did you find her?"

_This voice... I know this voice._

"...Yea," said Tunbe, hesitantly.

"And you let her escape?"

"I.. it-"

"You _do_ want to be risen, don't you?"

_Risen?_

"Y-Yes, Å¾ah," said Tunbe, quivering.

"Good. Then find her and bring her to my ship once you arrive."

"It shall be done."

_I need to hurry._ She began to run toward the entrance, but kept listening.

"Å½ah, I've also heard word about a kaln who can hear our radio and knows about the risen. Thi escaped from Ulukoma through the chaos."

_Linyu?_

"No one would take some kaln in kelp clothing seriously. Focus on your duty."

"Yes, Å¾ah."

"The plan begins at aphelion. Melna had better be there."

"You have my word."

The voices stopped and a pool of rage welled up within her from the static that remained on the line, but she handled it with the finesse of a leader. To let that passion burn uncontrollably would be to waste it. Instead she let it burn slowly, fueling her planning, crafting her speech, filling the hearts of her people. Passion was her own personal Ara, giving her the means to its own end.

Her fervid limbs slipped through the crowds of Rudjani who remained blissfully ignorant and powerless to the greater changes happening around them. They were hungry and they were envious; nothing would stop them from filling the docks of the merchant's quarter with their demands. She felt a false disdain for them but did not let it slow her charge toward the gates to Heiko. She was cautious as she approached the mostly empty gate, but did not see any signs of a trap.

She called to her from the inside, "Bavle...," but there was no response nor sign of anyone.

"Bavle!" she called again, making sure to be heard. But no one was there to hear her. _Neither fear of death nor promise of reward_, she recalled Bavle saying, and a wave of dread washed over her. The entire city had become an elaborate trap and she was in the middle of it all.
