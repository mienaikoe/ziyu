## Chapter 18

She knew that something was amiss at the train station when the crowds she expected to be waiting for the train were nowhere to be found. The steel pylons of the elevated line hung over the square and cast their endless lines of shadow upon it. The few occupants who dared remain there glanced around cautiously, as if wary for some all powerful demon who whisks trains and passengers in and out of existence.

After much searching, she quickly discovered that there was no sign of Pomri or Linyu, and then paused to ask a couple people if they had seen a woman and child, but they all averted their eyes and walked away the minute she reached out. _What happened here?_

From the corner of her eye, she spotted a little boy against a wall in a shaded corner staring at her. From the crevasse of his cloak he summoned her with a slight gesture of his hand, catching Melna off guard. But his gaze did not move, and she had no other leads to go on, so she approached him slowly, checking every corner and vantage point in the area.

"You are looking for someone?" he asked.

"Yes. A woman and a kaln. Have you seen them?"

"What is your name?"

"My name? Why do you ask?"

He remained silent, staring at her with the eyes of a child who had internalized the folly of trust.

Melna stood confidently and said, "I am Melna um Heiko. Now please tell me if you know where they've gone or I shall be on my-"

"Pomri and Linyu are in a safe place. They were walking into a trap at the station, but my nather removed them from the danger in time and stowed them on her ship. There was no time for them to say goodbye."

"No time? Why?"

"You will learn soon. But now, it is too dangerous in Rudjan. You must leave immediately."

He leaned closer to her and pulled some things out of a pocket in his coat.

"Linyu left this for you."

He lifted his hand from his coat and produced a satchel, which Melna hesitantly took and opened. On the top were two thick ornamental vials in a disc shape with a reddish liquid inside them.

"What is in these vials?"

"A cure for the undying."

She looked at him for a moment, trying to interpret his meaning, but paused to continue digging into the satchel. At the bottom was a copper coil embedded in a wooden puck: the same that Linyu was fiddling with. The coil had been hastily tied to a round glass plate, with one long length of wire pointed outward and a flap of dry kelp covering the center. Gently closing the satchel, she quickly hid the gift away in her field pack, still confused.

"Why did Linyu leave these for me?" she asked, bewildered, "And who are you?"

"The wind speaks," he said mysteriously. "You must listen."

He backed away and she shouted, "Wait!" but he was much too difficult to find in the dark and she stopped herself before getting lost in it.

_Who was he?_ She took out the coil device he gave her and ran her fingers along the copper windings, imagining what such a strange thing might be for. She knew that train motors often had coils of wire, but this didn't appear to be a motor of any kind. It was too delicate and precise to be pushing anything. _The wind speaks? Who are you?_

She looked down the wall toward the oceans of Ulu, and with her mind she reached out through the massive ocean rails that took Pomri and Linyu away. _Pomri knows what she is doing. They'll be alright without me_, she reassured to herself. Yet there was a looming dread hanging in her mind, battering her with guilt for not doing more to stop this from happening. Perhaps a more clever leader could have seen these dangers earlier; could have persuaded the senate not to give Holrag such power; could have fought for Liffa to stay here. She stopped herself when small droplets leapt out of her cheek.

"I will find you when this is over," she swore to them, "and you will have a home to come back to. I promise."

She turned and bowed as a parting gesture and looked back toward Rudjan with all its patches of wooden buildings haphazardly placed amongst the watery foreground, and surrendered all of her worries in order to focus. _They're invading Heiko but they also expected us to go to Shaki. I need to figure out what they're planning. And keep a low profile._ She loosened her black shawl and raised it above her head to form a makeshift hood, and tightened it again around her neck. With a quick glance and a first step she headed back to the conduit to get some answers.

Her feet retraced her steps down the pathway toward the conduit building, recalling her run-in with the strange man, and that eerie look of malice in his eyes. At the door, she shed her memories and focused on the task at hand: discovering the truth and drilling the truth out of the operator.

"Aey?" she called, but there was no answer. At the operator desk sat a man, tall and exhausted, speaking quietly into the microphone. He glanced at her and quickly murmured something quiet into the microphone and then shuffled from the desk to approach her.

"You can't be here. Please leave."

"The conduit is a public utility."

"Rudjan conduit is closed under order from the senate."

She lowered her hood and said, "I am a fidelant. There is no such order."

"You leave now!" he yelled, realizing who she was. He ran over to her to push her toward the door, but Melna spun his hands off of her arm and moved further into the room behind the desk, holding her hand out to keep him away. Her other hand hovered over the switch for the conduit, stopping the man in his tracks.

She said, "You seem agitated. Do you have some things to tell the rest of us?"

"Step away from the desk!"

"Ooh so you _do_ know what's happening to Holrag. Or maybe you know where they took my assistant."

He didn't say a word, but held his apprehensive stance. Melna glanced at the space across the table, her hand still at the ready.

"Have a seat," she said. "I'd like to talk."

He looked around for help or dignity, both of which he had found himself in a great debt, then kicked a stool out from underneath the table and reluctantly sat down.

She began, "Have you ever been to Heiko, žah...?"

He didn't respond.

"Operator, then. Well, operator, what do you know about Heiko?"

"You hoard food and lie to the world. Liffa told the senate."

"Is that what the operators are saying on the conduit these days? Now tell me. What do you talk about in the more secretive channels."

He donned a fake smile and said, "I have no clue what you're talking about."

Melna was quickly becoming impatient with him. She moved from her spot and around the table to lift him up and pin him against the table, his head not far from the button to the microphone.

He spoke between breaths with unwavering conviction, "You and your people. You're all criminals. Everybody knows it. You'll never succeed as long as Holrag is in power."

"Holrag, eh? Did their operator tell you about how their sociopath scientist kidnapped my jundmaman?"

"Scum like you don't deserve to die as heroes. But the blood of Holrag flows stronger in hae veins."

She leaned forward and stared close into his eyes on the desk, moving her free hand to the table.

"You know nothing about Liffa."

He laughed menacingly in her face, "I imagine it will be fitting, dying with all hae secrets amongst the remnants of her false home."

"Stop it!"

"It's a shame you'll never be able to say goodbye."

She maintained her scowl, her entire frontal lobe holding back from slamming his head against the table repeatedly until she felt better, but she knew this wasn't the time. She committed his words to the parts of her memory that were padded and padlocked and armored against the hardest truths, then simply lifted her hands from the switch of the microphone, making sure the operator saw her.

Her hands released his shirt and he slipped to the floor, still in shock. She spoke quietly, "Heiko is a warm place," she said quietly, "Full of beautiful places and generous people. But I want you to remember this. We know when we have been betrayed. We may suffer but we will rebuild. And those who rejoiced in our suffering will be the first to fall upon our swords."

He was still contemplating the microphone; if she had really broadcast so much to the conduit. The silence on the line was unbreaking and told him nothing. She gathered herself, glancing again quickly at the mess of rails and wires that filled the upper half of the room and took a step toward the door as he lifted himself from the floor.

When he had stood up, she turned her head and said, "You _will_ regret this day."

"I would quicker forget you," he chuckled quietly.

The floorboards creaked loudly under her feet as she quickly moved to the door and jolted it open it to leave, turning to take one last look at the operator and his room before closing the door behind her.

What he didn't know is that she had traced the rails of the conduit and discovered one that reached the ceiling but did not emerge from the roof. And in her pocket a new friend had made her a brand new device made specifically to listen to it. She held the coil up to her ear as she made her way through the crowds back to the gate where she had entered.

"It's Tunbe."

She could hear him as clearly as if he were standing right next to her.

"Heiko knows. We need to move fast."

A voice spoke in anger, "Did you find her?"

_This voice... I know this voice._

"...Yea," said Tunbe, hesitantly.

"And you let her escape?"

"I.. it-"

"You _do_ want to be risen, don't you?"

_Risen?_

"Y-Yes, žah," said Tunbe, quivering.

"Good. Then find her and bring her to my ship once you arrive."

"It shall be done."

_I need to hurry._ She began to run toward the entrance, but kept listening.

"Žah, I've also heard word about a kaln who can hear our radio and knows about the risen. Thi escaped from Ulukoma through the chaos."

_Linyu?_

"No one would take some kaln in kelp clothing seriously. Focus on your duty."

"Yes, žah."

"The plan begins at aphelion. Melna had better be there."

"You have my word."

The voices stopped and a pool of rage welled up within her from the static that remained on the line, but she handled it with the finesse of a leader. To let that passion burn uncontrollably would be to waste it. Instead she let it burn slowly, fueling her planning, crafting her speech, filling the hearts of her people. Passion was her own personal Ara, giving her the means to its own end.

Her fervid limbs slipped through the crowds of Rudjani who remained blissfully ignorant and powerless to the greater changes happening around them. They were hungry and they were envious; nothing would stop them from filling the docks of the merchant's quarter with their demands. She felt a false disdain for them but did not let it slow her charge toward the gates to Heiko. She was cautious as she approached the mostly empty gate, but did not see any signs of a trap.

She called to her from the inside, "Bavle...," but there was no response nor sign of anyone.

"Bavle!" she called again, making sure to be heard. But no one was there to hear her. _Neither fear of death nor promise of reward_, she recalled Bavle saying, and a wave of dread washed over her. The entire city had become an elaborate trap and she was in the middle of it all.
