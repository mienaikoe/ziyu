  - They wouldn't know about Heiko destruction
- ELSE

She knew that something was amiss when she saw a group of citykeepers leafing through the crowd at the station, looking for someone specific. The members of this crowd did not seem particularly rushed as a normal intending passenger might be, but glanced around cautiously, as if worried that their deepest secrets might become the target of the keepers' inquisition.

She walked along the perimeter of the area, searching for Pomri and avoiding the keepers, but after a long while she discovered no sign of Pomri or Linyu. She found a young maman, asked hae if thi had seen a woman and child, but thi averted hae eyes and walked away.

_What happened here?_

From the corner of her eye, she spotted the eyes of an older woman staring back at her from the shadows of an alleyway. She wore a thin ashen gray coat and hae mouth and nose was covered with a thick black cloth that was almost certainly the same material that Linyu was wearing. On her ear was a listener much like Linyu's. Melna planned her next steps carefully, checking every corner and vantage point in the area, and all the while the woman's gaze did not move.

"You are looking for someone?" she asked.

"Yes. A woman and a kaln. Have you seen them?"

"You have a pendant. Show me."

"My pendant? Whatever for?"

She remained silent, staring at Melna with the eyes of a woman who wasn't used to being distrustful.

Melna stood confidently and said, "I am Melna um Heiko. I am bound to Kipnu and Liffa and I don't need to show my most valued traditional heirloom to prove that to some thief. Now please tell me if you know where they've gone or I shall be on my-"

"Come with me," she interrupted, and turned down the wooden alley they stood in. Melna was exasperated. If not for her utter lack of any other leads, she would have turned around and left. But there was something about this woman; like the crucial piece of a puzzle, there was no way forward without her.

"First of all, who are you?" Melna asked as she caught up with hae.

"My name is Fanla," she said, removing her mask. Though it was dark, Melna could see more of the features of her face. She seemed younger than hae eyes would suggest, and her tone more soothing when unencumbered. "I was sent here by Linyu's mother to find hae and get hae to safety. When I finally spotted hae and the woman, they were walking into a trap at the station, but I was able to get to them in time."

"I want to see them. Where are they now?"

"They've fled the city on saffas. They're going back to Heiko."

"What? No! Heiko is in danger."

She stopped walking and Melna stepped and turned to stand in front of her.

"What do you mean?" Fanla asked.

"I overheard a man talking about Heiko. He said it would be a pile of rubble by morning."

"Even the greatest army in the world can't take a city in one night."

"Holragi doesn't need an army," Melna said. Her voice deadened the air.

"We must go after them," said Fanla. "They can't have gone far."

"Pomri and Linyu probably took both of our saffas to keep them safe, but there may be other saffas we could convince. Before we go, I have some business at the conduit to attend to."

"I'll wait for you at the gate then."

"No. Go on without me. You need to catch up with them."

Fanla replied, "I understand."

They said their goodbyes and Fanla receded down the alleyway and turned onto a pier that led the south gate and the harbor where towering sea-rail linkages stood proudly in the sky. Melna went in the opposite direction, her feet taking her thinking mind back to the spot where Fanla was staring at her. She peered down the wall of the station toward the skies above Heiko, and with her mind she reached out through the dusty path that Pomri and Linyu had traveled. _Pomri knows what she's doing_, she reassured herself. Yet there was a looming dread hanging in her mind where her guilt nucleated and pervaded her thoughts. Perhaps a more clever leader could have seen these dangers earlier; could have persuaded the senate not to give Holrag such power; could have fought for Liffa to stay here. She stopped herself when small droplets leapt out of her flushed cheek.

"I will find you when this is over," she swore to them. "You will have a home to come back to. I promise."

Her eyes turned back toward Rudjan with all its patches of wooden buildings haphazardly placed amongst the watery foreground, and the keepers littered amongst the crowd, still looking for her. She surrendered all of her worries in order to focus. _I need to keep a low profile until I'm gone._ She loosened her black shawl and raised it above her head to form a makeshift hood, and tightened it again around her neck. With a quick glance and a first step she headed back to the conduit to get some answers.

Her feet retraced her steps down the pathway toward the conduit building, recalling her run-in with the strange man, and that eerie look of malice in his eyes. Somehow that man knew that Heiko would be destroyed. Somehow the maman knew right where Pomri and Linyu would be, knew to wait for her. There was some sort of network of information that was right under her nose, and she was determined to get to the bottom of it.

"Aey?" she called, but there was no answer. At the operator desk sat a man, tall and exhausted, speaking quietly into the microphone. He glanced at her and quickly murmured something quiet into the microphone and then shuffled from the desk to approach her.

"You can't be here. Please leave."

"The conduit is a public utility."

"Rudjan conduit is closed under order from the senate."

She lowered her hood and said, "I am a fidelant of the senate. There is no such order."

"You leave now!" he yelled, realizing who she was. He ran over to her to push her toward the door, but Melna spun his hands off of her arm and moved further into the room behind the desk, holding her hand out to keep him away. Her other hand hovered over the switch for the conduit, stopping the man in his tracks.

She said, "You seem agitated. Do you have some things to tell the rest of us?"

"Step away from the desk!"

"Ooh so you _do_ know what's happening in Holrag. Maybe you know why they're planning to destroy Heiko. Should I tell the world what you're doing here?"

He didn't say a word, but held his apprehensive stance. Melna glanced at the space across the table, her hand still at the ready.

"Have a seat," she said. "I'd like to talk."

He looked around for help or dignity, both of which he had found himself in a great debt, then kicked a stool out from underneath the table and reluctantly sat down.

She began, "Have you ever been to Heiko?"

He didn't respond.

"Have you ever spoken to someone from our lands?"

"You hoard food and lie to the world. The Holragi have shown the truth. You cannot hide."

"Is that what the operators are saying on the conduit these days? Now tell me. What do you talk about in the more secretive channels."

He hesitated and said, "I have no clue what you're talking about."

Melna was quickly becoming impatient with him. She moved from her spot and pivoted around the table with the microphone in hand, setting it down next to her on the desk.

He spoke between breaths with an unwavering conviction, "You and your people. You're all criminals. Everybody knows it. You'll never succeed as long as we are in power."

"A Holragi controlling the Rudjan conduit, eh? Maybe you know something about why your sociopath ex-fidelant kidnapped my jundmaman?"

"The blood of Holrag flows through Liffa's veins, far stronger than hae Heikoi blood. Thi has shown that thi is a true Holragi, deserving of hae title."

"And what title is that?"

"Martyr."

She leaned forward and stared intensely into his eyes as he smirked back at her. With a quick movement, she lifted a small blade to his neck. He lifted his hands in response, but they were too slow: the blade had already fallen below his head and nestled right into a crevasse in his skin where any movement would surely be deadly.

He laughed menacingly in her face, "It is a fitting end for a true Holragi, a shooting star in the night sky, a symbol of defiance against the Heikoi who squandered hae talents with tradition and sexism."

"You know nothing about Liffa."

"What sort of home cages its people in houses and families, eh? What sort of home forces someone into a job because their family did it?"

"Liffa wanted to carry on the tradition."

"Nobody wants to be a farmer. Especially not one who is destined to be a hero."

"And what about you?" she asked, leaning in to him a little bit more. "Do you call yourself a hero? Sitting here in your comfy chair, passing little secrets to your Holragi friends. Doesn't it sicken you to coordinate the deaths of tens of thousands of people?"

"Heiko is a scourge on the world. You deserve what's coming to you."

"Your own people are plotting to conquer the world!"

"And the world will fall to its knees and beg for it!"

She maintained her scowl, her entire frontal lobe holding back from slamming his head against the table repeatedly until she felt better, but she knew this wasn't the time. His words were committed to the parts of her memory that were padded and padlocked and armored against the most difficult of truths. She simply lifted her foot from the switch of the microphone, and allowed the clamor on the line to inform the operator of what he'd just done.

"Heiko is a warm place," she said quietly, "Full of beautiful places and generous people. But I want you to remember this. We know when we have been betrayed. We may suffer but we will rebuild. And those who rejoiced in our suffering will be the first to fall upon our blades."

She gathered herself, glancing again quickly at the mess of rails and wires that filled the upper half of the room and took a step toward the door as he lifted himself from the chair.

When he had stood up, she turned her head and said, "You _will_ regret this day."

"I would quicker forget you," he chuckled quietly.

The floorboards creaked loudly under her feet as she quickly moved to the door and jolted it open it to leave, turning to take one last look at the operator and his room before closing the door behind her.

What he didn't know is that she had traced the rails of the conduit and discovered one that did not emerge from the roof where the other cables did. And that waiting at the gates was a woman who could hear everything.

"It's Tunbe," said the operator. He spoke with a muffled voice but Fanla could hear him as clearly as if he were standing right next to her. "Melna knows. We need to move fast."

A man's voice came on the line in anger, "Of course she knows! The whole world knows! Why couldn't you keep your damn mouth shut?!"

Tunbe was silent.

"Where is she now?"

"She's–"

"Escaped, hasn't she? You _do_ want to be part of the Red Circle, don't you?"

"Y-Yes, žah," said Tunbe, quivering.

"Good. Then find Melna and bring her to my ship once you arrive."

"It shall be done."

"Žah... if I may, I've also heard word about a kaln who can hear our radio. Thi escaped from Ulukoma through the chaos."

_Linyu_

"No one would take some kaln in kelp clothing seriously. Focus on your duty."

"Yes, žah."

"The plan begins at aphelion. Melna had better be there."

"You have my word."
