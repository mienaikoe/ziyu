## Chapter 18

She already knew that something was amiss at the train station. The winds had slowed to a standstill, and the elevated rails that hung over the square held their voice in punctuation of the silence that pervaded there. The few of its occupants seemed to be dodging each others' glances, fearful of some spirit that might curse them if they accidentally stared too long. She quickly discovered that there was no sign of Pomri or Linyu, and then paused to ask a couple people if they had seen a woman and child, but they all averted their eyes and walked away the minute she reached out. *They must have seen something. What happened?*

From the corner of her eye, she spotted a brass coil just like the one Linyu was fiddling with, sitting in a corner of two walls. She walked toward it, trying her best not to look suspicious, and picked it up. the coil wrapped around a small round piece of metal with two thin flaps on each end. *What was Linyu planning to build?*

She looked around one last time and concluded that Pomri must have gotten worried after she took so long and gone to the conduit looking for her. Even if they weren't there, she still might get a lead on what the man meant by Heiko being rubble. As she left, she couldn't shake the feeling that something had happened to Pomri and Linyu, but she affirmed to herself that her course of action was the best option to take at the moment. She retraced her steps down the pathway toward the conduit building, recalling her run-in with the strange man, and that eerie look of malice in his eyes. At the door, she shed her memories and focused on the task at hand: discovering the truth and drilling the truth out of the operator.

"Pomri?" she called, but there was no answer. At the operator desk sat a man, tall and exhausted, speaking quietly into the microphone. He glanced at her and quickly murmured, "Rudjan conduit requesting delay," and then shuffled from the desk to approach her.

"You can't be here. Please leave."

"What do you mean? The conduit is a public utility."

"Rudjan conduit is closed indefinitely under order from the senate."

"I am a senator. There is no such order."

"You leave now!" he yelled, pushing her out. Melna spun his hands off of her arm and moved further into the room behind the desk, holding her hand out to keep him away. Her hand hovered over the switch for the conduit and the man stopped in his tracks. 

She tried to calm him down, "You seem agitated. Like you know something you don't want to say." He didn't say a word, but held his apprehensive stance.

Melna glanced at the chair across the table. "Have a seat," she said. "I'd like to tell you a bit about myself." She took the operator's seat.

"Have you ever been to Heiko, žah...?"

He didn't respond.

"Operator, then. Well, Žah-Operator, what do you know about Heiko?"

"You hoard food and shroud your knowledge in lies."

"Did you hear that from that conduit of yours?"

He held his silence.

"Or perhaps you have another source. Say one... without rails?"

"What strange dreams are you cooking up in that mind of yours?"

She leaned forward and subtly slipped her elbow onto to the conduit switch.

"In Heiko, we have a communal way of life. We take care of each other, regardless of how different we are. And we extend that warmth to everyone we meet. But mark my words, we know when we have been betrayed. We will run; we will rebuild. And those who stood by watching us suffer, and die, will be the first to answer for their crimes."

He smiled back at her and said, "I don't know what you're talking about."

She stood up and gathered herself, glancing quickly at the room and took a step from behind the desk.

When she was next to him, she turned her head and said, "You *will* regret this one day soon."

"I will forget it just as I do any nonsense," he chuckled quietly.

She quickly moved to the door and jolted it open it to leave, turning to take one last look at the room before closing the door behind her.

  If Melna Finds them: 
    - Asks questions, finds answers to her questions
    - Melna knows that Linyu has a gift, Knows about Radio, has hope to speak with Liffa.
    - If captured by Fajro, would be found with Pomri and Linyu
      - Would Fajro care about the others?
        - Would Fajro just kill them?

    - Melna would go to the conduit for answers
      - Would find Radio and put 2 and 2 together
      - Would ask about Heiko and get a reveal about a plot against her and Heiko
    - If captured by Fajro, the others could get away, or one of them could be bartered for
      - But then he'd just kill them. Is Pomri an expendable character?
        - Does Linyu need help?
          - With Antikan, could be healed.

  "Ramne. Who is Ramne?"

  "I've heard of him," Pomri chimed in. "He used to be some nobody in the Rudjan guard who thought he was smarter than the rest of us. Never got promoted, so he just left us one day without a trace."


  Linyu whimpered in fear at his name, drawing Pomri's attention.

  "Eh? What's gotten into you?" she asked.

  Thi was getting ready to jump off of Laen-Laen and run, but Melna had already become aware of hae and leapt back to hae.

  "Hey, Linyu. What's wrong?" asked Melna, holding onto hae arms.

  "Ramne," thi said in a cracked voice, "He..."

  Tears were forming at the corners of hae eyes.

  "What did he do?"

  "Mom," thi said, at the end of hae wit.




  "I take it you're not a boat person. Well, we can't go back now so you're either coming with us or you're on your own again."

  Thi took a moment, feeling angry at the predicament thi was put into. There was nowhere to run, standing outside a massive city barred from entry, and Laen-Laen, who could take hae anywhere if anywhere were safe anymore. Thi placed hae hand on Kip's pendant under hae shirt and closed hae eyes in thought.

  "Together," thi whispered. Pomri smiled at hae courage.



"The train here is shut down too," Pomri said with disappointment.

"Nevermind that I need to speak with Linyu," said Melna.

"What's gotten into you?" Pomri asked, suspicious.

Melna stooped to Linyu's level and gazed into hae firey blue eyes. She was sure that the woman had them too.

"Do you know a woman named Ginnu and a possibly her partner?" she asked.

Linyu was shocked, "H-How.."

"I need to know, Linyu. Please tell me. Who are they?"

"Kanosin"

"They sell kanosin?"

Thi nodded in confirmation.

"Did you know they are looking for you?"

Hae hands began to tremble and she grasped them in comfort.

"Why are they after you?"

Thi pointed to the listener in hae ear.

"Why is this thing so important? What does it do?"

Thi began to cry but held hae wits together while trying to find a way to explain.

Melna pressed for simpler answers. 

"is it a weapon, some new material?"

Thi took the listener off hae ear and gave it to Melna, who hesitantly put it up to her ear.

"I can hear strange static sounds. Where is it coming from?"

Linyu gestured all around, wishing thi had hae transmitter there.

Pomri interjected, "You're wasting your time with this nonsense."

"Wait. I can hear someone talking," she said, still listening intently. She tried to hear the words, but could only hear a few through the noise.

"What are they talking about?" she asked Linyu again.

But instead of an answer Linyu held hae hand up to hae ear, telling her to keep listening.

She listened closer and then heard an unmistakeable voice of the maman who woke up early to sit under a tree. Who dressed her before she went to Shaki and gave her a kiss on the forehead even when thi was unhappy with her.

"Liffa! You're alive!"
