## Chapter 18

She knew that something was amiss at the train station when the crowds she expected to be waiting for the train were nowhere to be found. The steel pylons of the elevated line hung over the square and cast their endless lines of shadow upon it. The few occupants who dared remain there glanced around cautiously, as if wary for some all powerful demon who whisks trains and passengers in and out of existence.

After much searching, she quickly discovered that there was no sign of Pomri or Linyu, and then paused to ask a couple people if they had seen a woman and child, but they all averted their eyes and walked away the minute she reached out. *What happened here?*

From the corner of her eye, she spotted a little boy against a wall in a shaded corner staring at her. From the crevasse of his cloak he summoned her with a slight gesture of his hand, catching Melna off guard. But his gaze did not move, and she had no other leads to go on, so she approached him slowly, checking every corner and vantage point in the area.

"You are looking for someone?" he asked.

"Yes. A woman and a kaln. Have you seen them?"

"What is your name?"

"My name? Why do you ask?"

He remained silent, staring at her with the eyes of a child who had internalized the folly of trust. 

Melna stood confidently and said, "I am Melna um Heiko. Now please tell me if you know where they've gone or I shall be on my-"

"Pomri was captured and taken to Shaki aboard a private train."

"Who took her? Where is Linyu?"

"Linyu is in a safe place. There was no time for hae to say goodbye. As for Pomri, I couldn't see who took her but I'm sure it's Holragi."

"How... Who are you anywa-?"

"Linyu left this for you."

He lifted his hand from his coat and produced a copper coil just like the one Linyu was fiddling with. It had been hastily tied to a round glass plate, with one long length of wire pointed outward and a flap of dry kelp covering the center. With a gentle grasp, she lifted it from his hands and hid it in her coat sleeve, wondering why Linyu had left this for her.

"Left this for me?" she asked, bewildered, "But why?"

"The wind speaks," he said mysteriously. "You must listen."

He backed away and she shouted, "Wait!" but he was much too difficult to find in the dark and she stopped herself before getting lost in it. 

*Who was he? And Pomri, captured? How could that happen? Was she protecting Linyu?* She took out the coil device he gave her and ran her fingers along the copper windings, imagining what such a strange thing might be for. She knew that train motors often looked like this, but this didn't appear to be a motor. It was too delicate and precise to be pushing anything. *The wind speaks? Who are you, Linyu?*

She turned around and looked backward into the city, at the patches of tall buildings haphazardly placed amongst a watery foreground, and decided to suspend her worries about Pomri and refocus on Heiko. *Pomri is capable. She'll be alright without me. Our home cannot be destroyed.* Yet there was a looming dread hanging in her mind that something terrible would happen to Pomri.

She retraced her steps down the pathway toward the conduit building, recalling her run-in with the strange man, and that eerie look of malice in his eyes. At the door, she shed her memories and focused on the task at hand: discovering the truth and drilling the truth out of the operator.

"Pomri?" she called, but there was no answer. At the operator desk sat a man, tall and exhausted, speaking quietly into the microphone. He glanced at her and quickly murmured, "Rudjan conduit requesting delay," and then shuffled from the desk to approach her.

"You can't be here. Please leave."

"What do you mean? The conduit is a public utility."

"Rudjan conduit is closed indefinitely under order from the senate."

"I am a senator. There is no such order."

"You leave now!" he yelled, pushing her out. Melna spun his hands off of her arm and moved further into the room behind the desk, holding her hand out to keep him away. Her hand hovered over the switch for the conduit and the man stopped in his tracks. 

She tried to calm him down, "You seem agitated. Like you know something you don't want to say." He didn't say a word, but held his apprehensive stance.

Melna glanced at the chair across the table. "Have a seat," she said. "I'd like to talk for a moment."

"Have you ever been to Heiko, žah...?" She began.

He didn't respond.

"Operator, then. Well, operator, what do you know about Heiko?"

"You hoard food and shroud your knowledge in lies. Your maman told the whole senate."

"Is that what they're saying on the conduit these days? Now tell me. What do they say in the more secretive channels."

"What a sad person you are constructing such fantasies in your head. Everybody knows what you're trying to do and you'll never get away with it."

"Whatever it is you think we're trying to do, Holragi has far worse in store." 

"They will save us from the obscura–"

"But at what cost?"

She leaned forward and placed her hands on the desk, subtly slipping her elbow onto the conduit switch.

"In Heiko, we value community above all else. We take care of each other, regardless of how different we are. And we extend that warmth to everyone we meet. But I want you to remember this most of all: we know when we have been betrayed. We may run but we will rebuild. And those who reveled in our suffering will be the first to answer for their crimes."

He smiled back at her and said, "I don't know what you're talking about."

She stood up and gathered herself, glancing again quickly at the mess of rails and wires that filled the upper half of the room and took a step from behind the desk.

When she was next to him, she turned her head and said, "You *will* regret this day."

"I would quicker forget you," he chuckled quietly.

She quickly moved to the door and jolted it open it to leave, turning to take one last look at the room before closing the door behind her. What he didn't know is that she had traced the rails of the conduit and discovered one that reached the ceiling but did not emerge from the roof. And in her pocket was a brand new device made specifically to listen to it. She held the coil up to her ear as she made her way through the crowds back to the gate where she had entered.

"It's Tunbi."

She could hear him clearly through the device.

"Heiko knows. We need to move fast."

An unfamiliar voice spoke in response, "All units, begin the blockade. Let's push those hoarders into the dark."

A pool of anger welled up within her, but she contained it within her awareness to make room for the urgency she felt for her people. Wherever Linyu had gone, she was confident Pomri would keep hae safe. Heiko needed her.

With a sort of graceful agility, her fervid limbs slipped her through the crowds of hungry Rudjanese filling the merchant docks and to the row of gates they had entered through.

She called to her from the inside, "Bavle...," but there was no response nor sign of a person.

"Bavle!" she called again, making sure to be heard. But no one was there to hear her. She recounted what Bavle said about her duty as gatekeeper, and felt her muscles tense as a shadow of dread washed over her. The entire city had become an elaborate trap and she was in the middle.
