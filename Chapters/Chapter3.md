	In this chapter, I'm exploring the first instance of action writing.

	The messenger, Wes is delivering a note from a local observatory
	that has found evidence of a peculiar sunspot that doesn't move and is growing.

	He doesn't know what's in the message. Only that there has been an ongoing correspondence between Mel and observer Shib, and that this message was urgent.

	They proceed back to the messenger office to send the message via tele-line and her assistant takes the call and promises to deliver the urgent message. The message itself is cryptic and neither Wes nor Lif can understand it.

	Lif decides to go to the city (about 100km - 5 clicks away) to find out more. Once she gets there, she is stopped and told to wait as the meeting is already underway. Lif uses her agility and stealth to snoop on the meeting after Mel has delivered her news. The meeting is still tough to understand as there is heated argument and debate about what to do. The chapter ends on a pivotal reveal of the plot driver

	"Ara? Why would Mel need to know about that?"

	"The observers on Falni Peak are doing some study about the stellar surface and they said they had found something big and needed to tell Melna right away"

	*She was lying to me*

	"Well, if she's not here, I should go back to call the capital."

	"Wait. Let me go with you."

	"Oh that's really not necessary -"

	"I won't slow you down," I chided to him while I ran off to fetch a new pair of trousers as quickly as I could.

	The late morning starlight was just enough for me to see while I dashed to the bike under the veranda on the side of the house. The seat was freezing from being in the shade all night and all morning, but I hopped on anyway and endured the bitter cold on my back. I had a sliver of a moment to remember when Wes and I used to ride along the foggy coastline in the mornings. We would play hide and seek on a wide open beach and just get lost yelling at each other in the gray abyss until the fog lifted.
	*Not the time for memories*. I snapped out and rushed to the front gate where Wes was waiting for me.
	"Didn't think we would be doing this again, " he chuckled.
	"You better not hide from me this time"
	"Maybe you should work on your seeking"

	The winds were slowly picking up while we rode down the sintered clay path from my home toward the center of town. The perfect ring of the black crown was splitting the sky in two. Ara was to our right and Ulu, the darkness, was to our left.
