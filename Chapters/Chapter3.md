	In this chapter, I'm exploring the first instance of action writing.

	The messenger, Jes is delivering a note from a local observatory
	that has found evidence of a peculiar sunspot that doesn't move and is growing.

	He doesn't know what's in the message. Only that there has been an ongoing correspondence between Mel and observer Shib, and that this message was urgent.

	They proceed back to the messenger office to send the message via tele-line and her assistant takes the call and promises to deliver the urgent message. The message itself is cryptic and neither Jes nor Lif can understand it.

	Lif decides to go to the city (about 100km - 5 clicks away) to find out more. Once she gets there, she is stopped and told to wait as the meeting is already underway. Lif uses her agility and stealth to snoop on the meeting after Mel has delivered her news. The meeting is still tough to understand as there is heated argument and debate about what to do. The chapter ends on a pivotal reveal of the plot driver

	"Ara? Why would Mel need to know about that?"

	"The observers on Falni Peak are doing some study about the stellar surface and they said they've found something big and need to tell Melna right away"

	*She was lying to me*

	"Well, if she's not here, I should go back to call the capital."

	"Wait. Let me go with you."

	"Oh that's really not necessary -"

	"I want to know more; I won't slow you down" I pleaded to him while I ran off to fetch a new pair of trousers as quickly as I could.

	The late morning starlight was just enough for me to see while I dashed to the bike under the veranda on the side of the house. The seat was freezing from being in the shade all night and all morning, but I hopped on anyway and endured the bitter cold on my back. I had a sliver of a moment to remember when Jes and I used to ride along the foggy coastline in the mornings. We would play hide and seek on a wide open beach and just get lost shouting to each other in the gray abyss until the fog lifted.
	*Not the time for memories*. I snapped out and rushed to the front gate where Jes was waiting for me.
	"Didn't think we would be doing this again, " he said.
	"Well, I never thought I would join with a member of the court."
	"Yea. You surprised us all."

	The winds were slowly picking up while we rode down the long, sintered-clay path from my home toward the center of town. The perfect ring shape of the crown of Palinan was splitting the sky in two. The white light of Ara and its orange splendor was to our right and Ulu, the darkness, was to our left. Several clouds hung high the sky, reaching across the crown to enter into that dark abyss. I wondered what was happening to Ara. As a child, I learned that the observers had found that Palinan was orbiting Ara in a big ellipse, which gives us the day and night times. They also knew that there were other stars like Ara very far away, but much too far to reach in our lifetimes. I wonder if the stars could die like we did.
	At the end of the path, we turned a corner and crossed the rail line just after the station, onto a side street into town. It was rather peaceful, as the first meal time had just passed into rest time. He quickly parked his bike against a wall beside the door and I followed suit, parking mine against his. When I entered, he was already at the phone desk attempting to reach the court.
	"Shaki Conduit, This is Heiko Conduit."
	There was silence for a while. He repeated.
	"Shaki Conduit, This is -"
	"Heiko Conduit, this is Shaki Conduit. Please give me a moment, I'm routing a call."
	"Shaki Conduit, I am requesting priority. This is an urgent call to Shaki Court."
	There was silence again for a moment.
	"Heiko Conduit, which conduit in the court are you requesting connection to?"
	"The Heiko Senator's private conduit, please."
	The conduit operator paused.
	"Heiko Conduit, I assume you have a damn good reason for that."
	"I assure you, I do."
	He paused again.
	"Transferring you to Heiko Senator. Please wait a moment."
	I took the moment of silence to shift to a chair and sit down close Jes. He opened the message and flattened it on the table, reciting the more technical words. I glanced at it and could read small pieces of the handwriting. There was a scribbled drawing of a circle and some dots on it.
