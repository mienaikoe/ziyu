Mel filled the kitchen mantle with kindling from the garden and commenced an arduous fight to get it to light. As a survivalist, Linyu likely knew that the kindling had become too wet to light, but remained quiet in hae gratitude toward Melna. Sensing her own frustration building, Melna took a break and drew two cups of water from the spigot just below the dew column at the center of her home.

"You must be thirsty, Linyu. Have some water."

At first Linyu hesitated, staring at the cup an obvious anxiety. But with some chiding, thi took a small sip and winced as thi began to swallow. Mel immediately noticed, and rose to take the cup down and examine hae neck closer.

"You have a lot of swelling in here. What happened?"

"Fffire," said Linyu.

"Oh no! That's terrible!"

There were a million questions hiding in her throat, but her lips were blocking them for fear of overwhelming the child.

"Was it in the city? I didn't hear of any fire."

Linyu stared into the distance, hae eyes unmoving, untelling. She had to build more trust.
