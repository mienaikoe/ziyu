Mel filled the kitchen mantle with kindling from the garden and began to attack it with her hot tip to get it to light. Linyu sat on a large cushion in the middle of the dimly lit great room watching on. Thi likely knew that the kindling had become too wet to light, but remained quiet in gratitude. Sensing her own frustration building, Melna stopped trying to start a fire and drew two cups of water from the spigot just below the dew column at the center of the house.

"You must be thirsty, Linyu. Have some water."

At first Linyu hesitated, staring at the cup an obvious anxiety. But with some chiding, thi took a small sip and winced as thi began to swallow. Mel immediately noticed, and rose to take the cup down and examine hae neck closer.

"You have a lot of swelling in here. What happened?"

"Fffire," said Linyu.

"Oh no! That's terrible!"

There were a million questions hiding in her throat, but her lips were blocking them for fear of overwhelming the child.

"Was it in the city? I didn't hear of any fire."

Linyu stared into the distance, hae eyes unmoving, untelling. She had to build more trust.

She reached under her shirt to reveal her pendant. Silver, and slightly worn from use.

"Have you seen one of these before? It's a pendant that my nather made for me. We keep track of our family trees with tiny engravings of crests on the inside."

Slowly, she removed it from her neck and held it out to Linyu, who was still staring into the distance. 

"Want to see it?"

Linyu was hesitant but took a look anyway. She watched as Linyu looked intently at the engravings, almost as if thi had a purpose. Suddenly, thi reached into hae shirt and pulled out a pendant of hae own and began to compare the two. Melna was shocked to see Kipnu's pendant in the hands of this strange kaln.

"Where did you get that?!" She asked.

Linyu quickly finished checking the two and hae eyes started to water. Without a moment's pause, thi flung haeself at Melna and weeped into her shoulder.

"Kip," thi whispered through tears. She let hae cry a bit more but her mind kept racing back and forth to all of the possibilities that could have led to this moment.

"Is he ok?" She asked.

Thi shook hae head.

"Was it the fire?"

Thi shook hae head again.

"Do you know where he is?"

"Mom," thi whispered with a tremble.

"Your mother â€“ he's with your mother?"

Thi began to cry more and Mel held her shoulder out to cry on. For the moment, she believed Kip to be safe.

"Why don't you get a little rest, little one. We'll talk more in the morning."

Thi nodded and let go of Mel, rubbing hae eyes and cheeks as thi moved away.

"You can sleep on the bed, and I'll stay out here in the great room. How about that?"

Thi nodded, not wanting to make any more decisions.

"Okay, let's get you cleaned up."

She drew a bucket of water from the dew column and fetched a towel for hae to wash with. There weren't any robes small enough, but Liffa's robes came close, so she pulled them from the cellar and gave them to Linyu.

"You can rinse yourself with the towel. You'll probably be swimming in these robes, but just put them on and I can tie them to fit."

Thi whispered, "Thank you" and proceeded into the washroom with the bucket and towel, leaving the robes just outside the door.

Melna moved back to the pendants and quickly put hers back before searching Kip's for clues. It smelled faintly of ocean, but nothing else stood out to her. *What happened to you, Kip? How did this kid bring your pendant all the way from Ulukoma? And why?*
