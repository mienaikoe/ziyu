"Senator Melna, I think you should see something."

Melna stopped her work abruptly and left the incandescent lamp breathing light onto her makeshift desk to approach a man sitting in the dark. His eyes were fixed on a smoothly polished plate before him while his hands gently fumbled with the damper controls of a large telescope pointed toward the horizon. She appeared behind him, unseen but heard, and he made room for her without looking away.

"What should I be looking for, Thimlu?" Melna asked.

"Look for a line of small dots rising up from the horizon."

Melna stared into the image plate, searching for any sign of a light in the darkness.

"It's just the sky," she said.

"Close your eyes for a moment, and then open them."

She did as the observer instructed, closing her eyes for longer than she had the patience for, then opened them again. A tiny string of five dots, easily mistaken for dust but as bright as Ara, hung upon the thin yellow-orange of the horizon sky.

"What are they?" she asked with new urgency.

"Spacecraft. It looks like Holragi has their rail working."

Flushed with anger, she rose from the plate and closed her eyes, facing the darkest corner of the room.

"How large are they? Can they fit a person?" She asked the darkness.

The observer answered her, "I can't tell at this distance, but judging by the frequency of these launches, I think they're testing the rail in anticipation of something."

Melna remained silent.

"What should we do, žah-Melna?,"

Melna took a few deep breaths to regain her composure.

"Record everything. Every dot, every time. And find a way to determine their shape and size. Wire your findings to me at the senate before dinner. I'm calling for a debate in the evening."

"We shall keep a constant eye."

"And Thimlu," she recalled, "Keep your lines open. Communication is the only way we'll get through this."

"You have my word, žah."

Thimlu scurried away to fetch some empty film plates while Pomri rose from her desk and approached Melna.

"If I could interject. The senate still believes that Liffa's mission is the only way out of this mess. They won't listen to an appeal."

"This goes beyond my relationship with Liffa. This is about Holragi's secrets. All of Palinan is relying on then to lead the way, and still they refuse to share anything."

"This is their plan. We must play by their rules."

"That is far too much power for one province to hold."

"Perhaps you're right. But we have no other option."

Mel sighed, exasperated at how she let things go this far. "We need to find a way to force Holragi to speak. They are hiding something."

"Your pleading will be met with hostility, Melna."

"Do you suggest we cower in fear, waiting for the day Holragi saves us all?"

"There is much to lose and very little to gain by bothering them," she said. "Why don't we focus on rebuilding our grain reserves in the steppe. We've lost half to politics. We could afford to build more."

"And what if the obstruction decides to disperse one day? We'll all be roasted alive out there."

"And we will have starved to death long before that happens if we stay here. We can only do what is within our power."

Melna sighed, letting her internal frustration simmer down and settle.

"Ask me tomorrow. I have to go home."

Pomri threw her hands up in disappointment as Melna reached for a thick felted black cloak and opened the door of the observatory to leave. A chilly breeze clambered through the door and into Pomri's robes, forcing her to clasp her arms.

Melna turned back to her and said, "Meet me tomorrow at the first train to Shaki. Bring observer Shimla's findings."

"But the trains aren't running to Heiko."

"Bring your saffa. We'll ride to Rudjan and catch the second train there."

"That's ridiculous!"

Mel closed the door behind her, ignoring Pomri's complaints.

A small enclosed oil lantern hung beside the door, which she picked up and lit with a hot tip, treading carefully down the muddy steps so as to avoid the newly formed dew puddles. Her mind was littered with worries, all of them feeding her imagination of watching Lif sobbing, fearful, and alone in a cramped machine far away from home. The wind threw a gust at her, and she wondered if it was cold in space; if Lif was cold. She imagined wrapping her arms around hae to keep hae warm, and it made her feel warmer too.

At the foot of the hill stood Laen-Laen, rolled up to keep out the cold, and napping as usual.

"Come on Laen-Laen, let's go home."

He whimpered a little, a suspicious complaint for a freezing saffa.

"Laen-Laen, what's wrong?"

He shifted his legs a little to reveal a kaln dressed in strange kelp clothing curled into a ball at Laen-Laen's belly.

"Oh my goodness," she exclaimed, reaching for hae hand, "Are you ok?"

Thi stirred and looked up toward Melna's voice, showing hae eyes flecked with glowing blue spots and a sort of dark haze. By the time Melna had realized the pattern was not a reflection of Ulu, the kaln was scurrying away from Melna and the saffa. But to her surprise thi didn't run away. As she looked closer, thi saw hae face overwhelemed with confusion and bewilderment.

"It's ok. I'm here to help," she comforted.

In the dark, she could see two hand-shaped bruises around hae neck. Her eyes lingered on them, then turned to a strange device around hae left ear. Laen-Laen moved closer to sniff and lick the kaln's head, but thi stayed unmoving.

"I am Melna," she said deliberately. Her hand rose to clasp haes. Thi flinched at first, and softened.

"What is your name?" she asked gently.

The kaln could only muster a whisper through hae raspy voice, so Melna bent down closer to hear.

"Lin... Yu."


********


Mel filled the kitchen mantle with kindling from the garden and pressed her hot tip against it to start a fire. Linyu sat staring at the wall in the dimly lit great room. Thi gasped when thi smelled smoke, remembering the heat of the fire and the screams of panic, but quickly snapped out of it for fear of making hae host suspicious. Mel sensed something off about the kaln and moved to a large dew column at the center of the house to draw two cups of water from the spigot.

"You must be thirsty, Linyu. Have some water."

At first Linyu hesitated, staying still with the cup next to hae eyes, Mel holding them with obvious anxiety. When thi began to reach softly all around for where the cup might be, thi took it  and with a small sip, winced as thi began to swallow. Mel immediately noticed, and rose to take the cup down and examine both hae neck and eyes closer.

"Have you always been blind, Linyu?"

Thi fidgeted nervously and whispered, "...No"

"You also have a lot of swelling here. What happened?"

"F-Fire," Linyu whispered.

"Oh," she said, surprised to hear a lie. "You should know that I'm a great listener. It's literally my job to listen to people all day. If you ever want to tell me what really happened, you can say so."

After a moment of thought, Linyu whispered again, "Fire."

There were a million questions hiding in Melna's mind, but her lips were blocking them for fear of overwhelming the child.

"Was it in the city? I didn't hear of any fire."

Linyu stared into the distance, hae eyes unmoving, untelling.

"Why don't you get a little rest, little one. We'll talk more in the morning."

Thi nodded and took one more sip of the cold water.

"You can sleep on the bed, and I'll stay out here in the great room. How about that?"

Thi nodded, not wanting to make any more decisions.

"But first, let's get you cleaned up."

She drew a bucket of water from the dew column and fetched a towel for hae to wash with. There weren't any robes small enough, but Liffa's night robes came close, so she pulled them from the cellar and gave them to Linyu.

"You can rinse yourself in the washroom. These robes will be big on you, but just put them on for now and I can tie them to fit."

Linyu looked up to her mouth with grateful eyes and mustered hae strongest, "Thank you". Melna led hae into the washroom with the bucket and towel, leaving the clean robes just outside the entryway.

"Take your time. I'll be right out here."

"Water?" Thi whispered.

Melna paused in confusion and then realized that the kaln might never have had plumbing before.

"Oh. Right... Come with me."

She led hae to a simple twist valve that fed into a wide plate set into the wall not more than hae own height. With her hand on haes, they opened the valve until a small flow of water exited at the plate and spread evenly across the ground. Thi held out hae hands to feel the drops cover hae fingers and trickle down hae arms. Mel watched as an involuntary smile crept up hae face, and couldn't help but smile too.

"Well I'll leave you to your wash-up," she said and left the room with the towel sitting on a short table near the entryway.

Mel glanced around the room and found the large cushion to the left of the door to sit on. The softness was inviting to her legs, weary from hiking down the hill. She took a second to clear her head, but before she could settle down, the kaln's footsteps emerged from the washroom showing a bare Linyu fumbling with a large pendant and the trinket on hae ear.

Melna averted her eyes and stammered, "Linyu, you shouldn't show strangers your body."

Linyu paused for a moment to interpret the strangeness of what Melna had just said, and then continued setting down the trinket on the ground near hae and then feeling hae way back to the washroom. Hesitantly, Melna moved her gaze to the trinket. It was wooden with intricate carvings on the top that seemed to have survived through a great number of trouble. She turned it over to find three jagged holes drilled into the bottom.

*What is this thing?*

She faintly heard some noise coming from it, and put it up to her ear. It was just static at first, but she listened closer and could faintly hear a voice saying "Altitu- **** -bing. Speed 27- ****.  -tation stable". She was confused at what she was hearing but listened to it more.

"**** -entation now."

Linyu startled her from a trance-like fixation, standing in front of her with Liffa's robes and hae own wet clothes in hae hands. Thi knew where the listener had gone, and carried a look of disappointment. Thi felt for her hands and then ripped it from her hands and hid it in hae robes.

She responded, "I'm sorry, I should have asked first."

Linyu whispered to haeself, "Mom."

"Your mother gave it to you?"

Thi nodded hesistantly, and clutched to it tighter.

"Where is thi now?"

Linyu stared into the void of reality between hae and Melna with eyes like dams holding back a flood of doubt.

"I'm sorry, we don't have to talk about that right now," Melna said, but Linyu had already turned away and started stumbling back into the washroom. A thump rang across the room as Linyu slammed the door behind hae and sat against it to block its movement. She picked up the half-empty water glass from the table in the great room and and reassumed her post at the door. Melna didn't try to open the door or talk to hae – when Liffa's mother had died, she consoled hae through the same thing and learned how important it was to hold a space for grief. It shook her to imagine feeling such a heavy loss while recovering from the brink of death; such that she had forgotten all of her own stresses and focused on the well-being of this one kaln.

"Linyu, may I come in?"

There was no response.

"Knock once if you want me to leave. Twice if you'd rather I stay here."

After a long stillness there came a shuffling and then a knocking against the door. *Tap...Tap.*

Slightly relieved, she responded, "Okay. I'll stay then."

She decided to be deliberate. Another prying question might push the kaln to leave, and it had become far too cold for anyone to be outside for the night.

"I promise that I won't ask any more questions. And I won't steal your ear device. I just have some water for you here by the door."

Thi slowly creaked the door open just enough to listen for Melna and reach for the glass which Melna gave eagerly. Thi kept the door cracked like this, sipping on water and listening vigilantly for any changes or movements. A crack of light shone through and Melna could see the texture of Liffa's robes clothing Linyu's shoulders.

"You know, my spouse... Liffa." she began, fighting off her own tears, "Thi used to run to the washroom whenever thi was upset too. I never did a great job comforting hae. The other one was always better at it."

Linyu whispered, "Liffa".

"Yes... That's hae name..."

Thi slowly slid back the door and reached out a hand in search of hers. Hae hand walked up her arm gently tapping to find its way while thi looked intently at her face. It landed on hae pendant and probed its time-worn shapes and outlines with the fingers of someone who was strangely adept at observing by touch. Thi opened the door wider and moved closer to Melna, touching hae knees to hers. With the other hand, thi removed a pendant from hae own neck to show her.

"Mel-na?," Linyu whispered under hae tear-filled breath. Melna's hand clutched the pendant and felt the many scratches and warpings that had battered it, and she knew that he would not be coming back.

Thi wanted to say so many things to her; how Kipnu had saved hae life, how he escaped being enslaved and then led a near overnight revolution against the slavers of Ulukoma. But the most thi could muster was, "Kip. Love. You."

It was enough for Melna to know how much Kipnu must have trusted hae.

She held onto hae tightly, as if a great force was pulling them apart, and cried for the first time since losing Liffa to Holragi's ambitions. Linyu was pressing hae hands across her face, absorbing the tears while holding on as well. Thi wanted to tell her so many things, but thi knew the pain would be too great for her to swallow.

Mel fell asleep crying, lying on the ground outside the washroom with Linyu's hand still clutched in her own. Linyu lay awake next to her, thinking about how it must have been for the three of them to live there, how lonely Melna must be feeling now, and how thi felt a bond with her that thi struggled to describe. It was a kind of trust that thi had never experienced before: blind but unwavering in spite of it. But thi knew that Kipnu trusted her with his own life and that made trusting her far easier.

Before thi went to sleep, thi interlocked hae hands with Melna's and mouthed to her a silent resolution.

"To save Ara. To save you. I swear to follow you until the end."

Thi held a moment of mental silence to internalize the promise, and then rolled back over to find a comfortable position. *Tomorrow will be the beginning of our paths back home*.


<!--
and pushed the listener onto Melna's ear, much to her confusion, but she graciously took the offer anyway. She listened intently as Liffa's haunting voice bid her goodbye from the great void of space through the dense fog of static. The words echoed through her mind and sent her into fit of panicked anguish. She could hardly breathe between the exhales of anger.

"Maybe pohua," I interjected.

"...What?"

"Pohua. I grow it at home. It can grow under some very harsh conditions. We could surrender all the food that we have stockpiled, and then quickly grow Pohua to stock up."

She lowered the lantern to the floor and pulled out a charcoal and paper from her bag.

"How long does it take to grow?"

"It grows to maturity around 40 Tova after planting."

"That's too long. What will they eat in the meantime?"

"They can do an early harvest on the crops they're currently growing. The other crops will likely die from inadequate light before 40 Tova anyway."

She noted down my plans and put the paper and charcoal back in her bag.

"Practical and smart. Thank you."
