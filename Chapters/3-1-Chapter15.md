"Senator Melna, I think you should see something."

Melna stopped her work abruptly and left the incandescent light of her desklamp to approach a man sitting in the dark at a telescope plate pointed toward the horizon. His eyes were exhausted but transfixed on the plate before him, as he carefully adjusted a dial on the lens output and made room for Melna.

"What should I be looking for, Thimlu?" Melna asked.

"Look for a line of small dots rising up from the horizon."

Melna stared into the image plate, searching for any sign of a light in the darkness.

"It's just the sky," she said.

"Close your eyes for a moment, and then open them."

She did as the observer instructed, closing her eyes for longer than she had the patience for, then opened them again. A tiny string of five dots, easily mistaken for dust but as bright as Ara, hung upon the thin yellow-orange of the horizon sky.

"What are they?" she asked with new urgency.

"Spacecraft. It looks like Holragi has their rail working."

Flushed with anger, she rose from the plate and closed her eyes, facing into the darkest corner of the room.

"How large are they? Can they fit a person?" She asked the darkness.

The observer answered her, "I can't tell at this distance, but judging by the frequency of these five launches, I think they're testing the rail in anticipation of something."

Melna remained silent.

"What should we do, žah-Melna?,"

Melna took a few deep breaths to regain her composure.

"Record everything. Every dot, every time. And find a way to determine their shape and size. Wire your findings to me at the senate before dinner. I'm calling for a debate in the evening."

"We shall keep a constant eye."

"And Thimlu," she recalled, "Keep your lines open. Communication is the only way we'll get through this."

"You have my word, žah."

Thimlu scurried away to fetch some empty film plates while Pomri rose from hae desk and approached Melna.

"If I could interject. The senate still believes that Liffa's mission is the only way out of this mess. They won't listen to an appeal."

"This goes beyond my relationship with Liffa. This is about Holragi's secrets. All of Palinan is relying on then to lead the way, and still they refuse to share anything."

"This is their plan. We must play by their rules."

"That is far too much power for one province to hold."

"Perhaps you're right. But we have no other option."

Mel sighed, exasperated at how she let things go this far. "We need to find a way to force Holragi to speak. There is much that they are hiding."

"Your pleading will be met on deaf ears, Melna."

"Do you suggest we cower in fear, waiting for the day Holragi saves us all?"

"There is much to lose and very little to gain by bothering them," thi said. "Look. Why don't we focus on rebuilding our grain reserves in the steppe. We've lost half to politics. We could afford to build more."

"And what if the obstruction decides to disperse one day? We'll all be roasted alive."

"And we will have starved to death long before that happens. We can only do that which is within our power to do, Melna."

Melna sighed, letting her internal frustration simmer down and settle.

"Ask me tomorrow. I have to go home."

Pomri threw hae hands up in disappointment as Melna reached for a thick felted black cloak and opened the door of the observatory to leave. A chilly wind barrelled its way through the door and into Pomri's robes, forcing hae to clasp hae arms.

Melna turned back to hae and said, "Meet me tomorrow at the first train to Shaki. Bring observer Shimla's findings."

"But the trains aren't running to Heiko."

"Bring your saffa. We'll ride to Yansha and catch the second train there."

"That's ridiculous!"

She closed the door behind her, ignoring Pomri's complaints.

A small enclosed oil lantern hung beside the door, which she picked up and lit with a hot tip, treading carefully down the muddy steps so as to avoid the newly formed dew puddles. Her mind was littered with worries, all of them feeding her imagination of watching Lif sobbing, fearful, and alone in a cramped machine far away from home. The wind threw a gust at her, and she wondered if it was cold in space; if Lif was cold. She imagined wrapping her arms around hae to keep hae warm, and it made her feel warmer too.

At the foot of the hill stood Laen-Laen, rolled up to keep out the cold, and napping as usual.

"Come on Laen-Laen, let's go home."

He whimpered a little, a suspicious complaint for a freezing saffa.

"Laen-Laen, what's wrong?"

He shifted his legs a little to reveal a little kaln dressed in strange reed clothing curled at his belly.

"Oh my goodness, are you ok?" She asked, reaching for hae.

Thi looked back at Mel and shifted away with eyes transfixed, wanting to run but too exhausted to do so.

"It's ok. I'm not here to hurt you," she comforted her.

With a hook-and-wrap motion, Mel gently placed her hands under the hae arms and propped hae upright on Laen-Laen's chest. In the dark, she could see severe bruises around hae neck. Her eyes lingered and then turned to a strange device around hae left ear. Laen-Laen sniffed and licked the kaln's head, but thi stayed unmoving,

"I am Melna," she said deliberately. Her hand turned to clasp haes.

Trying to respond, the kaln could only muster a whisper, so she bent down closer to hear hae.

"Lin... Yu."

********

Mel filled the kitchen mantle with kindling from the garden and pressed her hot tip against it. Linyu walked around the dimly lit great room, filled with awe at  the immensity of her house. Thi paused to watch Melna at the wood, remembering the smell of smoke and the screams of panic, but quickly snapped out of it and continued hae tour. Sensing her own frustration building, Melna stopped trying to start a fire and moved to a large dew column at the center of the house to draw two cups of water from the spigot.

"You must be thirsty, Linyu. Have some water."

At first Linyu hesitated, staring at the cup in her hand with obvious anxiety. Thi took the cup after the dryness of hae mouth spoke loudest and with a small sip, winced as thi began to swallow. Mel immediately noticed, and rose to take the cup down and examine hae neck closer.

"You have a lot of swelling in here. What happened?"

"F-Fire," Linyu whispered.

"Oh no! That's terrible!"

There were a million questions hiding in her mind, but her lips were blocking them for fear of overwhelming the child.

"Was it in the city? I didn't hear of any fire."

Linyu stared into the distance, hae eyes unmoving, untelling.

"Why don't you get a little rest, little one. We'll talk more in the morning."

Thi nodded and let go of Mel, rubbing hae eyes and cheeks as thi moved away.

"You can sleep on the bed, and I'll stay out here in the great room. How about that?"

Thi nodded, not wanting to make any more decisions.

"Okay, let's get you cleaned up."

She drew a bucket of water from the dew column and fetched a towel for hae to wash with. There weren't any robes small enough, but Liffa's robes came close, so she pulled them from the cellar and gave them to Linyu.

"You can rinse yourself with the towel. These robes will be big on you, but just put them on for now and I can tie them to fit."

Linyu looked up to her with grateful eyes and mouthed, "Thank you", and then walked into the washroom with the bucket and towel, leaving the clean robes and the device on hae ear just outside the entryway.

Mel glanced around the room and found the large cushion to the left of the door to sit on. The softness was inviting to her legs, weary from hiking down the hill. She took a second to clear her head, but before she could settle down, the kaln's footsteps emerged again from the washroom, showing Linyu, unabashedly bare save for a pendant and fumbling with the trinket on hae ear.

Melna averted her eyes and stammered, "Linyu, you shouldn't show strangers your body."

Linyu paused for a moment to interpret the strangeness of what Melna had just said, and then continued setting down the trinket on a table near her and running back off to the washroom, knocking twice once inside to let Melna know thi was out of eyeshot. Hesitantly, Melna moved her gaze to the trinket, which Linyu had placed next to Kip's pendant. It was wooden with intricate carvings on the top that seemed to have survived through a great number of trouble. She turned it over to find three jagged holes drilled into the bottom.

*What is this thing?*

She faintly heard some noise coming from it, and put it up to her ear. It was just static at first, but she listened closer and could faintly hear a voice saying "Altitu- **** -bing. Speed 27- ****.  -tation stable". She was confused at what she was hearing but listened to it more.

"**** -entation now."

Linyu startled her from a trance-like fixation, standing in front of her with Liffa's robes and staring at the listener with disappointment. Thi took it from her hands without hesitation and hid it in hae robes.

She responded, "I'm sorry, I should have asked first."

Linyu whispered to haeself, "Mom."

"Your mother gave it to you?"

Thi nodded hesistantly, and clutched to it tighter.

"Where is thi now?"

Linyu stared back at her with eyes like dams built with doubt. Thi walked angrily back toward hae old clothes next to the washroom door.

"I'm sorry, we don't have to talk about that right now."

A thump rang across the room as Linyu slammed the door behind hae. From where she sat, Mel could hear the painful breaths and sniffles of a child trying to find the balance between the pain of speaking with the pain of losing hae mother. She felt powerless, unfamiliar to her but to a past she had long forgotten. It brought a pair of tears to her own eyes as she empathized with Linyu. Mel instinctively walked toward the cries in the washroom, bringing the half-empty glass of water as a sign of peace.

"Linyu, may I come in?"

There was no response.

"Knock once if you want me to leave. Twice if you'd rather I stay here."

After a long stillness there came a shuffling and then a knocking against the door. *Tap...Tap.*

Slightly relieved, she responded, "Okay. I'll stay then."

She decided to be deliberate. Another prying question might push the kaln to leave, and it had become far too cold for anyone to be outside for the night.

"I promise that I won't ask any more questions. And I won't steal your ear device. I just have some water for you here by the door."

Thi slowly creaked the door open just enough to look outside at Mel's distance, and reach for the glass. Thi kept the door cracked like this, sipping on water and glancing at Mel with exhausted but vigilant eyes. In the crack of light, she could see that the reed trousers and top thi had worn before had returned to hae body.

"You know, my spouse... Liffa." she began, fighting off her own tears, "Thi used to run to the washroom whenever thi was upset too. I never did a great job comforting hae. That was more of the other one's job."

Linyu whispered, "Liffa".

"Yes. That's hae name."

Shifting away from the door, thi slid it back and pushed the listener onto Melna's ear.

She listened intently as Liffa's haunting voice bid her goodbye from the great void of space through the dense fog of static. The words echoed through her mind and sent her into fit of panicked anguish. She could hardly breathe between the exhales of anger, guilt, and shame.

"Mel-na," Linyu whispered under hae breath, as thi moved closer to comfort her. Hae hand clutched hers, and they both held on tight, as if a great force was pulling them apart.

Mel fell asleep still crying, lying on the ground outside the washroom with Linyu's hand still clutched in her own. But Linyu lay awake, unsure of how to tell her about Kip, but certain that anyone he trusted with his life could be trusted with hae own.

"Maybe pohua," I interjected.

"...What?"

"Pohua. I grow it at home. It can grow under some very harsh conditions. We could surrender all the food that we have stockpiled, and then quickly grow Pohua to stock up."

She lowered the lantern to the floor and pulled out a charcoal and paper from her bag.

"How long does it take to grow?"

"It grows to maturity around 40 Tova after planting."

"That's too long. What will they eat in the meantime?"

"They can do an early harvest on the crops they're currently growing. The other crops will likely die from inadequate light before 40 Tova anyway."

She noted down my plans and put the paper and charcoal back in her bag.

"Practical and smart. Thank you."
