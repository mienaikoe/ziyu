"Senator Melna, I think you should see something."

Melna stopped her work abruptly and left the incandescent light of her desklamp to approach a man sitting in the dark at a telescope plate pointed toward the horizon. He was carefully adjusting a dial on the lens output as he made room for Melna.

"What should I be looking for?" Melna asked.

"Look for a line of small dots rising up from the horizon."

Melna stared into the image plate, searching for any sign of a light in the darkness.

"It's just the sky," she said.

"Close your eyes for a moment, and then open them."

She did as the observer instructed, closing her eyes for longer than she had the patience for, then opened them again. A tiny string of five dots, easily mistaken for dust but as bright as Ara, hung upon the thin yellow-orange of the horizon sky.

"What are they?" she asked with new urgency.

"Spacecraft. It looks like Holragi has their rail working."

Flushed with anger, she rose from the plate and closed her eyes, facing into the darkest corner of the room.

"How large are they? Can they fit a person?" She asked the darkness.

The observer answered her, "I can't tell at this distance, but judging by the frequency of these five launches, I think they're testing the rail in anticipation of something."

Melna remained silent.

"What should we do, žah-Melna?,"

Melna took a few deep breaths to regain her composure.

"Record everything. Every dot, every time. And find a way to determine the shape and size of these dots. Wire your findings to me at the senate before lunch. I'm calling for a debate at midday."

"Yes, žah."

The observer scurried away to fetch some empty film plates while Pomri rose from her desk and approached Melna.

"If I could interject. The senate still believes that Liffa's mission is the only path to salvation. They would never listen to an appeal."

"This goes beyond my relationship with Liffa. This is about our first contact with whatever is up there, and Holragi being secretive about it. Their technology is rapidly outpacing ours, but they never stopped to consider the ethics of their tests."

"This is not the time for an ethics debate. There are millions of people starving in the dark!"

"And what good are we doing them by sending giant hunks of metal hurtling toward our agressors? And what if all that metal comes back and lands here?"

"We have no other options."

"We need to force Holragi to speak. They need to tell us what they know."

"Shaki will always side with them. The whole world is desparate for a solution, Melna. You have to drop this. We've already lost half of our food reserves. We can't afford to lose more."

"Pomri, I taught you better than this. Everyone in the senate is simply trying to delay the inevitable while Holragi is hiding the only lead we have to our survival. All of Shaki is being held hostage by Holragi. We can't just relinquish all our power to them."

"So what do we do then? Beg them to play nice?"

She sighed, letting her internal frustration simmer down and settle.

"Ask me tomorrow. I have to go home."

Pomri threw her hands up in disappointment as Melna reached for a thick felted black cloak and opened the door of the observatory to leave. A chilly wind barrelled its way through the door and into Pomri's robes, forcing hae to clasp hae arms.

Melna turned back to hae and said, "Meet me tomorrow at the first train to Shaki. Bring observer Shimla's findings."

"But the trains aren't running."

"Bring your saffa."

"That's ridiculous!"

"Do it!" She snapped, and closed the door.

A small enclosed oil lantern hung beside the door, which she picked up and lit with a hot tip, treading carefully down the muddy steps so as to avoid the newly formed dew puddles. Her mind was littered with worries, all of them feeding her imagination of watching Lif sobbing, fearful, and alone in a cramped machine far away from home. The wind threw a gust at her, and she wondered if it was cold in space; if Lif was cold. She imagined wrapping her arms around hae to keep hae warm, and it made her feel warmer too.

At the foot of the hill stood Laen-Laen, rolled up to keep out the cold, and napping as usual.

"Come on Laen-Laen, let's go home."

He whimpered a little, a suspicious complaint for a freezing saffa.

"Laen-Laen, what's wrong?"

He shifted his legs a little to reveal a little kaln dressed in strange reed clothing curled at his belly.

"Oh my goodness, are you ok?" She asked, reaching for hae.

Thi looked back at Mel and shifted away with eyes transfixed, wanting to run but too exhausted to do so.

"It's ok. I'm not here to hurt you," she comforted her.

With a hook-and-wrap motion, Mel gently placed her hands under the hae arms and propped hae upright on Laen-Laen's chest. In the dark, she could see severe bruises around hae neck. Her eyes lingered and then turned to a strange device around hae left ear. Laen-Laen sniffed and licked the kaln's head, but thi stayed unmoving,

"I am Melna," she said deliberately. Her hand turned to clasp haes.

Trying to respond, the kaln could only muster a whisper, so she bent down closer to hear hae.

"Lin... Yu."

********

Mel filled the kitchen mantle with kindling from the garden and began to attack it with her hot tip to get it to light. Linyu sat on a large cushion in the middle of the dimly lit great room watching on. Thi likely knew that the kindling had become too wet to light, but remained quiet in gratitude. Sensing her own frustration building, Melna stopped trying to start a fire and drew two cups of water from the spigot just below the dew column at the center of the house.

"You must be thirsty, Linyu. Have some water."

At first Linyu hesitated, staring at the cup an obvious anxiety. But with some chiding, thi took a small sip and winced as thi began to swallow. Mel immediately noticed, and rose to take the cup down and examine hae neck closer.

"You have a lot of swelling in here. What happened?"

"Fffire," said Linyu.

"Oh no! That's terrible!"

There were a million questions hiding in her mind, but her lips were blocking them for fear of overwhelming the child.

"Was it in the city? I didn't hear of any fire."

Linyu stared into the distance, hae eyes unmoving, untelling. She had to build more trust.

She reached under her shirt to reveal her pendant. Silver, and slightly worn from use.

"Have you seen one of these before? It's a pendant that my nather made for me. We keep track of our family trees with tiny engravings of crests on the inside."

Slowly, she removed it from her neck and held it out to Linyu, who was still staring into the distance.

"Want to see it?"

Linyu was hesitant but took a look anyway. She watched as Linyu looked intently at the engravings, almost as if thi had a purpose. Suddenly, thi reached into hae shirt and pulled out a pendant of hae own and began to compare the two. Melna was shocked to see Kipnu's pendant in the hands of this strange kaln.

"Where did you get that?!" She asked.

Linyu quickly finished checking the two and hae eyes started to water. Without a moment's pause, thi flung haeself at Melna and made whimpering breaths into her shoulder.

"Kip," thi whispered through tears. She let hae cry a bit more but her mind kept racing back and forth to all of the possibilities that could have led to this moment.

"Is he ok?" She asked.

Thi shook hae head.

"Was it the fire?"

Thi shook hae head again.

"Do you know where he is?"

"Mom," thi whispered with a tremble.

"Your mother – he's with your mother?"

Thi began to cry more and Mel held her shoulder out to cry on. For the moment, she believed Kip to be safe.

"Why don't you get a little rest, little one. We'll talk more in the morning."

Thi nodded and let go of Mel, rubbing hae eyes and cheeks as thi moved away.

"You can sleep on the bed, and I'll stay out here in the great room. How about that?"

Thi nodded, not wanting to make any more decisions.

"Okay, let's get you cleaned up."

She drew a bucket of water from the dew column and fetched a towel for hae to wash with. There weren't any robes small enough, but Liffa's robes came close, so she pulled them from the cellar and gave them to Linyu.

"You can rinse yourself with the towel. These robes will be big on you, but just put them on for now and I can tie them to fit."

Thi looked up to her with grateful eyes and mouthed, "Thank you", and then walked into the washroom with the bucket and towel, leaving the robes just outside the entryway.

Melna moved back to the pendants on the cushion and quickly returned her own back to her neck before searching Kip's for clues. It smelled faintly of the ocean, but nothing else stood out to her. *What happened to you, Kip? How did a kaln find your pendant and then bring it all the way back here?*

The kaln's footsteps emerged again from the washroom, and showed Linyu, unabashedly bare and fumbling with the trinket on hae ear.

Melna averted her eyes and stammered, "Linyu, you shouldn't show strangers your body."

Linyu paused for a moment to interpret the strangeness of what Melna had just said, and then continued setting down the trinket and running back off to the washroom, knocking twice once inside to let Melna know thi was out of eyeshot. Hesitantly, Melna moved her gaze to the trinket, which Linyu had placed next to Kip's pendant. It was wooden with intricate carvings on the top that seemed to have survived through a great number of trouble. She turned it over to find three jagged holes drilled into the bottom.

*What is this thing?*

She faintly heard some noise coming from it, and put it up to her ear. It was just static at first, but she listened closer and could faintly hear a voice saying "Altitu- **** -bing. Speed 27- ****.  -tation stable". She was confused at what she was hearing but listened to it more.

"**** -entation now."

Linyu startled her from her trance-like fixation, standing in front of her with Liffa's robes and staring at the listener with a disappointed face. To her surprise, thi took the listener from her hands and put it back on hae ear.

She responded, "I'm sorry, I should have asked first."

Linyu whispered to her, "Mom."

"Your mom gave you this?" she asked.

Thi nodded hesistantly and moved to pick the pendant up again.

"Linyu, please. Let me have this. I am bound to Kipnu."

Thi stared back at her and re-adorned haeself with the pendant, still with an untrusting look on hae face. She walked angrily back toward hae old clothes next to the washroom door, and changed into them.

"Linyu, I'm sorry. I- I just... miss him."

Linyu ignored her as thi tightened the waist of hae reed trousers and walked to the door they came in from. Melna went after hae, so she wouldn't lose hae if thi left. Linyu paused at the door, turned to Mel and whispered, "Liffa".

Melna immediately forgot about chasing Linyu, "Liffa?! What do you know about her?"

"Liffa. Love. You," thi said with hae hand on hers.

Thi opened the door and slipped outside while Melna, shocked by what this strange kaln had just told her, stood still in confusion. Before she could recover her thoughts and run outside, Linyu had once again faded into the darkness, as mysterious as thi had appeared.

"Maybe pohua," I interjected.

"...What?"

"Pohua. I grow it at home. It can grow under some very harsh conditions. We could surrender all the food that we have stockpiled, and then quickly grow Pohua to stock up."

She lowered the lantern to the floor and pulled out a charcoal and paper from her bag.

"How long does it take to grow?"

"It grows to maturity around 40 Tova after planting."

"That's too long. What will they eat in the meantime?"

"They can do an early harvest on the crops they're currently growing. The other crops will likely die from inadequate light before 40 Tova anyway."

She noted down my plans and put the paper and charcoal back in her bag.

"Practical and smart. Thank you."
