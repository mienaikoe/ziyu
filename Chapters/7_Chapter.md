## Chapter 7


*"Do you hear it"*

I paused, listening intently for the sound.

*"The tree... do you hear it?"*

I looked up at my mother's chin, illuminated by the low sun of morning, and then out to the leaves on the tree swaying in the dim light.

*"Nature speaks"*

"In the silence," I finished hae sentence.

Thi held me closer but felt cold and fragile, like oversaturated clay. Thi kept a smile on her face as thi began to disintegrate between my fingers.

*"silence,"* thi whispered, and I could no longer distinguish her voice from the wind.

"Mama, Where are you going?!" I said, bewildered.

*"silence."*

Thi sublimated and coalesced into a cloud and vanished into the tree, turning its bark an earthen orange. The breeze picked up and the song of the Ziyu sang loudly all around me as I lay grasping the roots where my mother last spoke. I listened closer to the sound; closer than before. *Is there a pattern?*

"Good Morning, Liffa."

I woke in startled moans, *am I at home?*

"Sorry Liffa, hope I didn't scare you."

*The darkness. The hard floor. Where am I?*

"I'm the magistrate for your case. They told you I would be here, no?"

It all came back to me and my heart dropped again. I sat up and brushed off my back.

"Yea. They said you would be here tomorrow morning."

"It is tomorrow morning."

*Ohh*

He continued, "I can come back once you're fully awake."

"It's probably best you don't. I would be a mess if I were awake for this."

"Suit yourself."

The magistrate carried a lantern just as yesterday. He wore charcoal gray tightly-woven robes with a white inner layer and a red waist sash of the style of Shaki legalists. His facial expression showed the experience and clarity of at least a Ma'To as an orator.

He cleared his throat, mostly as a warmup, and began in a pronounced and regal tone.

"Liffa Um Heiko, you have been charged with corruption of consciousness and interruption of the senate during its deliberation. Do you understand?"

"I do."

"As a magistrate, it is my duty to uncover the facts surrounding a matter and deliver a just punishment under the law. Do you understand?"

"I do."

"Do you submit to questioning so that Shaki may uncover these facts and root out any lies of the accused."

"I do."

He broke into a more casual tone, "So at this point, I'm just gonna ask you some questions about yesterday, and make sure they check out with what I heard from the other interviews."

I was a bit surprised, but stammered an "Okay" in my sleepy stupor. He hung the lantern up on a hook and produced a paper and charcoal.

"All right. Question one -"

"Wait.. Why are you being so nice to me? I'm a criminal."

"I find these things go smoother when I'm not judging you from my shining pedestal on high. We all do strange stuff. Whether we feel convinced it's the right thing, or a fit of passion compelled us. I'm not here to judge you personally. I'm just here to translate the law."

"Oh. That makes sense."

"So anyway, Question one. What did you barge into the senate for?"

"I had to announce some news."

"It couldn't wait until after deliberation?"

"It was highly urgent; I had to get it out before they locked themselves into a spending decision or adjourned and left for the day."

"Did the senate agree?"

"I'm not sure. I think you'll find many who did."

He finished jotting his notes and then turned the page for the next question.

"Question two. How did you come upon this news?"

"It was hand-delivered to me by our town's messenger."

"Why wasn't the messenger the one to deliver it?"

"He had to maintain the conduit in Heiko."

"And your job?"

"I'm just a farmer. I can skip a day and make it up later."

"Well, not anymore," he said under his breath, and continued.

"So why was it delivered to you?"

"It was intended for Melna, my wife."

"Melna, as in the senator?"

"Yes."

"Ah. I see."

He wrote some more notes and turned the page again.

"So that leads to question 3. How did you get into the deliberation hall in the first place?"

"I was helping a disabled ex-senator who was traveling to the senate."

"My, you certainly walk in high circles. You have a name?"

He stared at me, while I hesitated.

He said, "Come on, Liffa. I've got no intention of nabbing your friend. There's nothing illegal about an ex-senator walking the grounds."

I thought about what Mel said about him. To never trust him. Perhaps the truth would help me more than protecting him would.

"Fajro. He was a senator for Holragi."

"Fajro, eh? That explains why he was so eager to ask about you."

"He asked about me?"

"Yea, you could say that. But we'll talk about that later. You were saying?"

"Oh. Yes, I was helping him walk on account of his injured leg, and he was helping me get to the deliberation hall. He believed in the importance of the news too."

"And how exactly did he help you?"

"He distracted the guards while I... snuck in."

"Ah, that makes sense."

He finished writing and folded the paper into an inner pocket of his robe.

"Ok, I have to get all formal again, now."

He took the lantern in his hand and reassumed his regal pose. It made me nervous even though it seemed silly.

"Liffa Um Heiko, I have gathered as many facts as I could and have reached a conclusion. I find you innocent of corruption of consciousness under the codex of Palinan and absolve you of all accusations of such claim."

I felt a slight relief, but knew the other was inescapable.

"However, the codex of the senate makes clear that any interruption of any kind during deliberation is illegal. For this reason, I find you guilty of interruption of the senate during its deliberation."

The conviction was expected, but it still hurt in an aggravating way. Like a tiny worm latched to my ribcage.

"The sentence shall be a period of three La'To at the shadestead in Ulu. Do you understa-"

The door opened in a rush, and the magistrate paused to see who caused the disturbance. Two lanterns were in view.

"Fajro? What are you doing here?" the magistrate asked.

I was thinking the same thing, but I quickly changed my mind when I saw the other face.

"Kip! You came!" I shouted.

He rushed to me and reached for my face with his free hand. Fajro walked in his slower pace toward us and attempted to bow to the magistrate.

"Oh there isn't any need of that," the magistrate said.

"Pardon my old habits. They've taken a permanent residence with me." He responded.

He reached the other side of Kip and looked closely at me, trying to telegraph something but I did not know what.

"I hope we came in time to defend Liffa," he said.

The magistrate responded, "Well, it's a little bit late, but I'll permit it if you have something to say worth adding."

The magistrate turned to me and asked, "Liffa, do you approve of Fajro's testimony?"

"Only if Kip is allowed to speak as well."

"Yes, that would be fine."

The magistrate took his paper and charcoal out again and turned to Fajro, motioning for him to speak.

Fajro began, "Liffa was helping me walk. I intended to interrupt the senate myself, and unwittingly inspired hae to finish the job when I was stopped by guards."

I was aghast. He was taking the blame? For what?

The magistrate stopped writing and laid his forehead into his hand. "That's quite a thing to admit, Fajro, but Liffa was still the one who actually interrupted the deliberation."

He replied, "I understand. I hope only that you give a lighter sentence in light of my testimony."

"Well, the codex of the senate has pretty clear guidelines on sentencing for interruption. I would be risking my post if I let hae free without punishment."

Kip, turned to the magistrate and pleaded to him, "Please. Lif had every positive intention. Thi doesn't deserve to be thrown to Ulu."

Fajro chimed in, "Perhaps an alternative arrangement can be made. One that is beneficial to both Liffa and all of Palinan."

Kip and the magistrate turned to him to hear more.

"If Liffa is inclined, thi could work with me in Holragi on our observational study of the obstruction."

I replied immediately, "I am not inclined."

"Hold on, Liffa, let me finish. You would be working with our engineers to send a spacecraft up and figure out what we're dealing with. It would take no more than a La'To, then you can head back home to Heiko."

I retorted, "And what use would a farmer be to scientists?"

"You would be a fantastic liaison between our engineers and the observers in Heiko, as you've had experience with both the Heiko messenger and their work."

He had a convincing argument, but I remembered what Mel said about him.

"I don't trust you. You could do anything with me and get away with it," I said.

"Sure, you can't trust me. But you also can't trust any of the criminals in Ulu either. If something were to harm the Heiko senator's spouse, the selfless hero-messenger, it would be awful for Holragi and our entire project. You would surely be in safe hands."

Kip added his opinion, "It does sound like a good deal, Lif. One La'To on the frontlines of civilization is much better than whatever you would get in Ulu."

"It would be three La'To in Ulu," the magistrate added. "I believe that Fajro's suggestion would be a fitting alternative and that the state would see more use in applying you to the problem than sending you someplace where you mindlessly twiddle your thumbs in the cold.."

I withdrew from the door and faced the wall. I had never felt so powerless before: my fate being discussed by a room full of powerful men while I stood in a cell, like I wasn't even there. And my decisions were now between two extremely risky cases. I listened intently to the silence surrounding us and begged for a message, but none came. The pulse in my head and the gentle shifting of cloth behind me filled my headsound.

"Let's give hae a moment, guys," I heard Kip say.

I turned around and found the back of his head and said "Wait, Kip. Just you."

The others gathered their lanterns and moved to the other room, the magistrate wrapping his arm around Fajro to help. I walked toward Kip but didn't reach for him this time.

"Kip... how many people know?"

"Know what?"

"What I came here to announce."

"Only the senate. Mel told me it's up to each province to decide that for itself. The governor of Heiko has decided to reveal by hierarchy."

"What's that?"

"In order to stave off panic, people are told one-by-one in private rooms and are given tasks to help so they don't just mentally shut down. My parents were part of the first test. When we had to ration for the winter of ash."

"I remember learning about that. My parents never wanted to talk about it. I suppose it hit them harder than most."

"All the farmers were working their hardest for the few days we had until the ash swallowed the sky. Then they cursed the air and covered their houses like the rest of us. They got the same rations as us of course, but the guilt of having nothing to contribute to your town must be crushing."

"You have no idea. We are a proud bunch. As steam lines and electric rails began to boom, we held on to the tradition of having every family devoting part of their land and part of their time to farming. There's a certain sense with crops that farmers have. No machine could ever copy it."

"Your spirit is admirable."

I reached for his shoulders under a thin, tightly woven tunic that he usually wore under his medical aprons. I reached for comfort more than for attention.

"Kip... What do you know about Fajro?" I asked.

"He's just a client. I check his leg out every once in a while. Why?"

"Did you know that he used to be a senator for Holragi"

"No... I didn't know about that."

"Did you know that he had a major falling out with Mel?"

"I didn't know about any of that... That means he could have planned this. I could have sent you into a trap."

"That's what I mean. His offer is suspiciously generous. I think he needs me but I don't know what for."

"Maybe to get back at Mel."

"No that's too petty. He could use me as a bargaining chip against her though. Get what he wants out of Heiko for a La'To."

"He would need you for longer than that to make it work, and Mel could simply push it to the news wire to nullify any bargaining. What do you suppose they're making in Holragi? This observational study. I thought Heiko had the best observatory."

"Maybe it has something to do with their space rail. Maybe they can send telescopes after all. But..."

Kip's face froze and looked worried all of a sudden. "No... they wouldn't."

"Wouldn't? Wouldn't what?" I asked, but too late. Fajro and the magistrate had lost patience and re-entered the room.

The magistrate announced to us with his casual voice, "I'd love to stand and chat in the dark with all of you, but I've got 13 field cases to cover today. Are you ready to continue?"

I answered him, "I'd like to ask Fajro about the study he's conducting."

"Why sure," Fajro said with a smile.

"Make it quick," said the magistrate, audibly annoyed.

"Fajro, what is the goal of this project?"

"Well it's a continuation of the rail project. I can't really talk about it without a guarantee of your cooperation. Provincial secrets."

"What do you need me for?"

"Like I said, you would be a communications liaison between The Heiko and Holragi scientists."

"I'm not much of a talker, and we all speak the same language here. What do you *really* need me for?"

He sighed and looked at the lantern light against the dusty ground.

"Liffa, you don't miss a thing do you. That's one of the reasons I think you'd be a good candidate for the job. The person has to be small, lightweight, observant, quick-learning, brave, and in great physical shape. You happen to fit all of those criteria."

"Are you saying what I think you're saying?"

Our eyes met and he looked at me intently. "We need you up there, Lif."

Like electric rails from one mind to the next, I finally saw the dream that he saw. The danger, the pride. The whole planet. *I could die. I could die!* I shouted inside my head. I wasn't afraid.

Meanwhile, Kip had grown impatient. He grabbed Fajro by his tunic and got in his face.

"That's a death sentence, you piece of shit. Who do you think you are?"

"Kipnu. Stop this," the magistrate tried to push Kip away, but wasn't succeeding.

"Kip," I tried to calm him, but he didn't hear me.

He pushed and slammed Fajro against the wall behind them. Fajro let out a cry of pain.

"Go somewhere else to find someone to murder. My family is off the table."

"Kipnu. This is ridiculous. Stop this immediately." The magistrate shouted, and Kip backed down. Fajro collapsed to the floor with a hand behind his head, and passed out. The magistrate rushed over to check on him.

"He's breathing, but unconscious. Kip, what were you thinking?"

Kip wasn't amused, "Oh come on. He's faking it," but was growing unsure. He walked slowly over to the magistrate, who was now anxious being around him, and checked Fajro's vitals. He was unconscious.

The magistrate turned to me and quickly said, "Liffa, let's return to this after we come back," while he grabbed Kip by the arm and took him to the outer room.

*Kip, what have you done?*

"Fajro?" I called. He didn't answer.

I stared at his sleeping face. It was wrinkled with the smiles of the past. *Were they genuine? Are you simply misunderstood?*.

The magistrate came back in with a strong-scented cloth and some water in a small bowl.

"He's still unconscious," I said.

"Yes, and he might be after that scene. What was Kip thinking?"

"He gets very protective sometimes."

The magistrate dipped the cloth into the bowl and placed it on his lips. Fajro's lips started to move and then purse, and then he woke in a daze.

"What happened?"

"You passed out, Fajro," said the magistrate in a calming voice.

"My head? Wha-"

"It's a bruise, Fajro. Nothing major."

"Kipnu. What happened?"

"Just rest. He's gone now."

I felt pity for Fajro; he didn't deserve to be pinned to a wall, but I was frustrated that he lied to me.

He sipped some of the water and sat up, motioning to the magistrate for the cloth. The magistrate handed it over and he put it behind his head.

"How are you feeling, Fajro?"

"I'll be ok."

"I'm going to have to leave. I'll take Kipnu with me. Are you going to be alright?"

"Yea I'll be fine."

I asked the magistrate, "What's going to happen to Kip?"

He stood up and walked over to me.

"Kipnu assaulted Fajro and interrupted his consciousness. He'll receive justice for -"

"Just tell me straight."

"He's going to Ulu."

My heart sank. *Dammit, you fool.*.

He turned to walk out the door and said to me, "I'm going to handle Kip's case and I'll be right back again. Don't go anywhere," he said while walking out the door.

Fajro and I sat in silence for a few va'ka, staring everywhere but at each other. A feeling of guilt and embarrassment pervaded me. I acknowledged the senselessness of feeling self-aware about something I hadn't done, but it sustained nonetheless. There were qualities about the gray stone walls that I hadn't noticed without the lanterns. Deep chisel markings and pits where the stone's roughness hadn't been softened yet. What an enormous endeavor it must have been to carve this city by hand. To know that you would never reap all of its benefits, but add your effort anyway. Our whole society was founded on the glorification of works for the greater good, but Kip had found something more important. Perhaps he is also doing the right thing.

"Your boy is strong," Fajro said to break the silence.

"He likes to take care of his body."

"Maybe he should take care of his mind too."

I was tempted to defend Kip, but this was not the time.

"I guess he's not a fan of the idea, then."

"Fajro, I'm going to be honest. None of us trust you. All of your plans seem to weave together in your favor a little too well."

"Well, I don't blame you. I tend to treat words as incantations more than expressions. They do what I want them to."

"Why do it? What luxurious paradise awaits you at the end of all this?"

"Oh don't you call me a lush. I might be a good liar, but I don't do it for the pleasure."

"Then why?"

"This is the only way to survive."

"What do you mean?"

"This obstruction. It's not going to stop 'til all of Ara is blotted out. You read it yourself. The only we can stop it is by sending someone out there to figure out what it is and then bombard the thing with whatever works against it."

"And you think your half-finished experiment can do that?"

"You think we built a space rail with dumb luck? It took 5 ma'to of collaboration with your observers. We learned everything we could from them and then we made breakthroughs with our engineering knowledge. We sent countless tests into space. Many of them orbited and then softly landed on their own with timers. We had space travel down to a science and that was taken from all of us when Heiko backed out of the deal."

"And you're still bitter about it."

"Damn right I am. And now Palinan is stuck here, huddling in the dark with no plan but to wait it out."

"So you're just doing this to prove you were right all along. And I'm your Heikoan hero for all the PR."

"Lif, none of our dreams or grudges matter if we're all dead. I know this is the only way to survive, and I'm using what skills I have to convince the people we need for the job."

The argumentation side of my brain went quiet. He was right. Even if we were enemies now, it wouldn't matter once we're all freezing and starving to death.

"Is it dangerous?" I asked.

"Of course it is"

"...Does it hurt?"

"What, space? Oh I suppose you haven't learned what it's like. Imagine a place with no ground, no air, no up or down, no noises. Just you, Ara, and infinite darkness. That's space."

I struggled to comprehend what that meant, but I didn't have much time until the door opened again.

"Fajro, how are you holding up," the magistrate asked.

"Fine, sir, fine."

He went over to Fajro to check on his head.

"You still look a bit pale, but you're getting better. Let me finish with Lif, and then we'll get you somewhere we can look closer at your injuries."

"Thank you, magistrate."

The magistrate stood up and moved closer to me.

"Liffa, I realized that I might have been a bit too hasty in my decision to switch the sentence. I've decided to let you choose where to go. Does that sound fair?"

I answered, "Yes, magistrate. You are generous."

"In that case, I'll continue where I left off."

He re-assumed his regal pose with paper and charcoal in hand, and cleared his throat in preparation.

"Liffa Um Heiko. I find you guilty of interruption of the senate during its deliberation. The sentence shall be a period of three La'To at the shadestead in Ulu *or* a period of one La'To under the command of Fajro Um Holragi. Do you understand?"

"I do."

"Then I await your decision within the next va'la. I will be back to -"

"Magistrate, I've already made my decision."

"You have?"

"I'm going to Holragi."
