## Interlogue


  "Senator Melna, I think you should see something."

  Melna stopped her work abruptly and left the incandescent light of her desklamp to approach a maman sitting in the dark at a telescope plate pointed toward the horizon. The observer was slowly turning a dial on the side and continued to turn it as thi made room for Melna.

  "What should I be looking for?" Melna asked.

  "Look for a small dot rising up from the horizon."

  Melna stared into the image plate, searching for a light.
  
  "It's just the sky," she said.

  "Close your eyes for a moment, and then open them again."

  She did as the observer instructed, closing her eyes for longer than she thought she needed, then opened them again. A tiny dot of light, as bright as Ara, could be seen streaking diagonally upward against the thick yellow of the horizon sky.

  "Lif," she said out loud without thinking. She rose from the plate and closed her eyes, facing into a dark corner of the room.

  She asked the observer, still facing away from hae, "How long has thi been up there?"

  "I would have to calculate to know for sure, but I would estimate about... a day."

  Melna remained silent and overwhelmed.

  "What should we do, žah-Melna?,"

  Melna took a few deep breaths to regain her composure.

  "Take photos until you can't see her anymore, then plot the trajectory and give me a copy of your findings to take to Shaki."

  "Yes, žah."

  The observer scurried away to fetch some empty film plates while Pomri rose from her desk and approached Melna.

  "Melna, if I may speak my mind, The senate will never listen to an appeal for one person when millions of others are at risk."

  "I'll make them listen."

"Maybe pohua," I interjected.

"...What?"

"Pohua. I grow it at home. It can grow under some very harsh conditions. We could surrender all the food that we have stockpiled, and then quickly grow Pohua to stock up."

She lowered the lantern to the floor and pulled out a charcoal and paper from her bag.

"How long does it take to grow?"

"It grows to maturity around 40 Tova after planting."

"That's too long. What will they eat in the meantime?"

"They can do an early harvest on the crops they're currently growing. The other crops will likely die from inadequate light before 40 Tova anyway."

She noted down my plans and put the paper and charcoal back in her bag.

"Practical and smart. Thank you."
