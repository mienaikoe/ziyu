  - This should be Liffa
  - Make all of this into the intro of Chapter 15

  - Melna is at Heiko Observatory and sees the craft hurtling into space.
  - She is furious at Holrag for doing something so reckless, and vows to go back to the senate to demand that they divulge their plans.
  - She is shown to be handling the heiko issue well while people talk about shaki falling apart in chaos. They suggest that it's safer for her not to go to Shaki.
  - She considers going directly to Holrag.
  - She sleeps on it.
  - Late at night, She gets a knock from a maman named Linyu who demands to speak with her at once. Kipnu sent her.

## Interlogue

"Twelve"

I sat in the dark capsule with cold and trembling hands, checking my shoulder straps and air mask for extra tightness. My muscles could barely pull anything through the shaking. Fajro assured me that the straps would hold me tightly against my seat so I wouldn't injure myself during the launch. _I think he cares, but I can't be sure._

"Eleven"

The tumblers from all the gauges burned their zeroes into my eyes as I went over what I had been taught. _The altimeter is on the left, in paces. My trajectory and turbulence is stable at 8000 paces, but I'll have to use the thruster knobs to control my orientation. Orientation! That's over-_

"Ten"

_Dammit it's too fast! Okay. Orientation is right of the altimeter._ I spun the ball a bit to get a feel for how I might use it once I got up there. _See, scribe, spin. Once every Va'la. Three red dots opposite Ara. And Ara itself._

"Nine"

The voice of a control officer filled my listener, "Capacitance: stable. Temperature: stable."

I instinctively responded, "Thank you," with my mask still on.

"Eight"

My whole body tensed up again. The anxiety came in waves with the countdown and immobilized me for half of the time. I clenched my right hand around the steel bracelet they had given me in the case of my death. _There's a reason I have this. I might die._

_"It's only dangerous if you mess up your mission."_ Fajro's reassurance was unhelpful.

"Seven"

"Ahhhnnnhhhh!" I screamed out to fight the panic, and seethed through my teeth at the pain my whole body and mind were in. _Breathe. Breathe. I need to focus to stay alive._

I focused again on the instrument panel. _Antenna 1: Retracted. Antenna. Antenna. Antenna. Antenn-_

"Six"

"ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhnnnn....."

I closed my eyes and tried to blank out my mind, but all of the instruction from my time in Holrag filled my head.

_Altitude. Orientation. Apoapsis. Gravitation. Oxygen._

"Five"

The panic had turned into sobbing.

_Am I dying? It feels like I'm dying Do I want to die? I wouldn't have to feel this. I want to die._

"Four"

Through my tears and screams, the amber light of the radio toggle beckoned to me, and my finger shot across the compartment to flip it.

I said "I can't do this. I can't do this. Get me out of here."

The deadpan voice of the mission director responded to me, "Silence on the line."

"No stop the mission. I can't do this."

The line bathed static while I melted into the seat, into my mask.

"Three"

I slammed on the reinforced door above me. It didn't budge, and bruised my hands instead.

_This can't be happening. Why me?_

"Two"

I ripped off my mask and pulled at my shoulder straps with whatever strength I could muster through my trembling bones. But they were made for forces far stronger than me. This whole craft was made to be controlled remotely. To make me powerless to control my fate.

The voice came on the line again, "No damage to craft. Continue."

"One"

I put my mask back on and clenched my fingers into the firm fabric of the seat.

_This is where I die._

"Power."

The acceleration instantly pinned me against the chair and I felt my binding pendant press tightly against my chest. All of my hydroderm was flattening backward, squeezing the liquid out onto the seat. The rails that powered the craft came in waves, announcing themselves through powerful pushes and sparks that became progressively quicker. I had no space for thoughts, only the suffering of pain and shock. Suddenly, the overbearing noise and darkness of the rail tunnel gave way and the light of Ara filled the cavernous compartment, echoed by the fluttering shake of the wind around me. Weightless, I watched as the water from my sweat and tears drifted into bulbous spheres around me, scattering the bright light of Ara.

The countdown voice came on the line, "Altitude 12,600 and climbing. Speed 27,000. Rotation stable."

And then the director interjected, "Liffa, set your orientation now."

Her voice snapped me out of my daze and I quickly checked the pressure gauge to make sure the vehicle seal was good, and then set the orientation for the direction of Ara, just as I was taught.

"When the orientation reads 20 down from the origin, let us know."

I toggled the radio on, and confirmed, "Okay"

My eyes were trained intently on the orientation ball, waiting for the reticle to match up with the line for 20. _After this point, I will be alone for days on a path to L1._ Tears welled up in me again, when I imagined how alone I would feel, dying alone in the great void. _There was no goodbye. Just silence as we let the space divide us. "I'll be waiting". Kipnu... You were always so optimistic. I bet you're back from Ulukoma by now, giving Melna hell._

The lines finally met. I inhaled the most painful breath and in the most broken voice said "Attitude 20 down"

"Liffa, Prepare for ignition"

The rockets kicked on and threw me back against the seat along with the water droplets. Again, my binding pendant pressed against my chest, and reminded me of my family, of my mother. Of every connection to home that I was leaving behind.

I breathed heavily into my mask and said, "Kipnu... Melna... I love you."
