  - Melna is at Heiko Observatory and sees the craft hurtling into space.
  - She is furious at Holrag for doing something so reckless, and vows to go back to the senate to demand that they divulge their plans.
  - She is shown to be handling the heiko issue well while people talk about shaki falling apart in chaos. They suggest that it's safer for her not to go to Shaki.
  - She considers going directly to Holrag.

## Interlogue

"Twelve"

My hands trembled uncontrollably in the darkness of the capsule as it lie still in the launching chamber of the Holragi space rail. I tried checking my shoulder straps and air mask for extra tightness, but my muscles could barely pull anything through the shaking. Fajro assured me that the straps were engineered to hold me tightly against my seat so I wouldn't injure myself during the launch. _I think he cares, but I can't be sure._

"Eleven"

The tumblers from all the gauges burned their zeroes into my eyes. I went over what I had been taught. _The altimeter is on the left, measured in paces. Stable trajectory at 8000 paces, but I'll have to use the thruster knobs to control my orientation. Orientation! That's over-_

"Ten"

_Dammit it's too fast! Orientation is to the right of the altimeter._ I spun the ball a bit to get a feel for how I might use it once I got up there. _See, scribe, spin. Once every Va'la. Three red dots opposite Ara. One big red dot for Ara._

"Nine"

The voice of a control officer filled my listener, "Capacitance: stable. Temperature: stable."

I instinctively responded, "Thank you," with my mask still on. But no one could hear me.

"Eight"

My whole body tensed up again. The anxiety came in waves with the countdown. I clenched my right hand around the steel knife-bracelet they had given me in the case of my death. _There's a reason I have this. I might die._

_"It's only dangerous if you deviate from your mission."_ Jathi's reassurance calmed me, but in the back of my mind I knew that none of them could be certain.

"Seven"

"Ahhhnnnhhhh!" I screamed out to fight the panic, and seethed through my teeth at the pain my whole body and mind were in. _Breathe. Breathe. I need to focus to stay alive._

I focused again on the instrument panel. _Antenna: Retracted. Antenna. Antenna. Antenna. Antenn-_

"Six"

"Antenna. Antenna," I said aloud.

I closed my eyes and tried to blank out my mind, but all of the instruction that had been ingrained in me in those two days were rattling around in my head.

_Altitude. Orientation. Apoapsis. Gravitation. Oxygen._

"Five"

The panic had turned into sobbing.

"Mama..." I cried aloud to hae memory. "I miss you now. I miss you more than ever."

"Four"

Through my tears and screams, the amber light of the radio toggle beckoned to me, and my finger shot across the compartment to flip it.

I said "I can't do this. I can't do this. Get me out of here."

The deadpan voice of the mission director responded to me, "Silence on the line."

"No stop the mission. I can't do this."

The line bathed static while I melted into the seat, into my mask.

"Three"

I slammed on the reinforced door above me. It bruised my hands, it didn't budge.

_Why me? Why am I here?_

"Two"

I ripped off my mask and pulled at my shoulder straps with whatever strength I could muster through my trembling bones. But they were made for forces far stronger than my body could muster.

This whole craft was made to be controlled remotely. To make me powerless to control my fate.

A voice came on the line again, "No damage. Continue."

"One"

I put my mask back on and clenched my fingers into the unyielding fabric of the seat.

_This is where I die._

"Power."

The acceleration instantly pinned me against the chair and I felt my binding pendant press tightly against my chest. All of my hydroderm was flattened against my body, squeezing liquid out onto the seat. The rails that powered the craft came in waves, announcing themselves through powerful pushes and sparks that became progressively quicker. I had no space for thoughts, only intense force and mental shock. Suddenly, the overbearing noise and darkness of the rail tunnel gave way and the light of Ara filled the compartment. I was immediately flung forward as the capsule came in contact with the air and turbulence shook and slowed its movements.

_five thousand six hundred_, I read on the altimeter as it began counting up. I reached the edge of the atmosphere and the wind slowly dwindled in strength until it became silent. I felt like I was falling, read the altimeter that told me I was rising. I looked out the window, and the instrument was right. Below me was a vast arc in a sea of black, lit by the light of Ara. _This is Palinan_, I thought. _All of this. The scorching desert, the lush green ring, the unknown darkness_. All around me inside the capsule, the water from my sweat and tears drifted into bulbous spheres around me, scattering the bright light of Ara.

"Antenna," I said to myself, and flipped the switch to deploy it.

The voice came on the line again, "Altitude 12,600 and climbing. Speed 27,000. Rotation stable."

And then Jathi interjected, "Liffa, can you hear us?"

His voice snapped me out of my daze and I quickly checked the pressure gauge to make sure the vehicle seal was good. The radio was left on.

"Yes. I can hear you," I said to the air.

"Check your orientation now," he said.

I checked the orientation gauge, "13 down from the origin."

"When the orientation reads 20 down from the origin, let us know."

I moved the outer marker dial to 20 down, just as I was taught and trained my eyes intently on the orientation ball, waiting for the reticle to match up with the horizon. _After this point, I will be alone for days on a path to L1._ Tears welled up in me again, when I imagined how lonely it would feel to die in this great void. There would be no goodbye. Just silence as we let the space divide us.

"I'll be waiting," I repeated his words in a whisper. "Kipnu... You were always so optimistic. I bet you'll have a few select words for Melna when you come back."

The lines finally met. I inhaled the most painful breath and in the most broken voice said "Attitude 20 down"

"Liffa, Prepare for ignition," said Jathi.

The rockets kicked on and threw me back against the seat along with the water droplets. Again, my binding pendant pressed against my chest, and reminded me of my family, of my mother. Of every connection to home that longed to keep me there.

I breathed heavily into my mask and mustered a grain of strength to speak.

"Kipnu... Melna..." I said.

"I love you."
