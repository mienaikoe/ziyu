  "Senator Melna, I think you should see this."

  She stopped her work abruptly and left her desk to approach a woman sitting at a telescope pointed at the horizon. She was slowly turning a dial on the side and continued to turn it as she offered her seat to Melna.

  "What should I be looking for?" Melna asked.

  "Look for a dot rising up from the horizon."

  She took the dial and continued the rotating movement as she looked through the glass. At first she didn't see anything, but after a moment she started to see a tiny shining object moving away from the horizon at a very quick speed.
