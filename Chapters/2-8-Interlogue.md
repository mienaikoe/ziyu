## Interlogue


  "Senator Melna, I think you should see something."

  Melna stopped her work abruptly and left the incandescent light of her desklamp to approach a maman sitting in the dark at a telescope plate pointed toward the horizon. Thi was carefully adjusting a dial on the lens output as thi made room for Melna.

  "What should I be looking for?" Melna asked.

  "Look for a small dot rising up from the horizon."

  Melna stared into the image plate, searching for any sign of a light in the darkness.

  "It's just the sky," she said.

  "Close your eyes for a moment, and then open them again."

  She did as the observer instructed, closing her eyes for longer than she had the patience for, then opened them again. A tiny dot of light, easily mistaken for dust but as bright as Ara, hung upon the thin yellow-orange of the horizon sky.

  "Lif," she said aloud without hesitation. Flushed with anger, she rose from the plate and closed her eyes, facing into the darkest corner of the room.

  "How long has thi been up there?" She asked the darkness.

  The observer answered her, "I would have to do the math to know for sure, but I would estimate about... a day."

  Melna remained silent.

  "What should we do, žah-Melna?,"

  Melna took a few deep breaths to regain her composure.

  "Record the path and figure out where they're sending hae. Wire your findings to me at the senate before lunch. I'm calling for a debate at midday."

  "Yes, žah."

  The observer scurried away to fetch some empty film plates while Pomri rose from her desk and approached Melna.

  "If I could interject. The senate will never listen to an appeal for one person. They have millions of others to worry about."

  "This goes beyond my relationship with Liffe. This is about our contact with whatever is up there. We all have the right to know what they discover."

  "Holragi will use your marriage against us."

  "Let them build their walls. Shaki will side with us."

  "They're more likely to create a secret channel with Holragi. Melna, you have to drop this. We've already lost half of our food reserves. We can't afford to lose more over some rogue senator's political game."

  "Pomri, I taught you better than this. Everyone in the senate is simply trying to prolong the inevitable while Holragi is hiding the only lead we have to our survival. We are in a game of their design and we are playing it whether we want to or not."

  "So what? We tell the creator their game sucks, and hope they listen to us?"

  "No. We have to make them change the rules."

  "And how do we do that?"

  She sighed, letting her internal frustration simmer down and settle.

  "Ask me tomorrow. I have to go home."

  Pomri threw hae hands up in disappointment as Melna reached for a thick felted black  cloak and opened the door of the observatory to leave. A chilly wind barrelled its way through the door and into Pomri's robes, forcing hae to clasp hae arms.

  Melna turned back to hae and said, "Meet me tomorrow at the first train to Shaki. Bring observer shimla's calculations."

  "But the trains aren't running."

  "We'll go by saffa."

  "That's ridiculous!"

  "Be there!" She snapped, and closed the door.

  She produced a small oil lantern and lit it with a hot tip, treading carefully down the muddy steps so as to avoid the newly formed dew puddles. Her mind was littered with worries, all of them feeding her imagination of watching Lif sobbing, fearful, and alone in a cramped machine far away from home. The wind picked up, and she wondered if it was cold in space; if Lif was cold. She imagined wrapping her arms around hae to keep hae warm, and it made her feel warm too.

  At the foot of the hill stood Laen-Laen, rolled up to keep out the cold, and napping as usual.

  "Come on Laen-Laen, let's go home."

  He whimpered a little, a suspicious complaint for a freezing saffa.

  "Laen-Laen, what's wrong?"

  He shifted his legs a little to reveal a little kaln curled at his belly.

  "Oh my goodness, are you ok?" She asked, reaching for hae.

  Thi looked back at Mel with eyes transfixed, wanting to run but too exhausted to do so. With a hook and wrapping motion, Mel gently placed her hands under the hae arms and propped hae upright on Laen-Laen's chest. The curious saffa sniffed and licked the kaln's head, but thi stayed unmoving,

  "I am Melna," she said deliberately. Her hand turned to clasp haes.

  Trying to respond, the kaln could only muster a whisper, so she bent down closer to hear hae.

  "Lin... Yu."

"Maybe pohua," I interjected.

"...What?"

"Pohua. I grow it at home. It can grow under some very harsh conditions. We could surrender all the food that we have stockpiled, and then quickly grow Pohua to stock up."

She lowered the lantern to the floor and pulled out a charcoal and paper from her bag.

"How long does it take to grow?"

"It grows to maturity around 40 Tova after planting."

"That's too long. What will they eat in the meantime?"

"They can do an early harvest on the crops they're currently growing. The other crops will likely die from inadequate light before 40 Tova anyway."

She noted down my plans and put the paper and charcoal back in her bag.

"Practical and smart. Thank you."
