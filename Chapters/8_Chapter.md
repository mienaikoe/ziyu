## Chapter 8


The ship to Ulu's shadestead looked like it had been made in a generation no longer living, and was patched up in places where the wood became weaker. Kip was used to bikes and trains: the vehicles of the land, not this ever-rocking monstrosity. But the trip wasn't long, and he might have believed he deserved punishment if he thought about it long enough. The captain was a tall, muscular woman by the name of Zaenta, or at least that's what he thought he overheard the escort call her. The ship had only a few criminals aboard, but each was accompanied by an escort. Most of the criminals seemed mentally detached - either addicted to kanosin or just plain depressed. One was just a maman child, with clear signs of kanosin withdraw. *These people need medical help. Ulu will only make them worse.*

After a few va'ma, they came near to a large island with tall trees and a bright bonfire roaring quite a way from the shore. The dimness of the sky made it feel like the end of the day, but they hadn't gone far. They could still see the outskirts of Shaki from across the sea. Kips escort unchained his arms and shoved him to get in a line along the side of the boat with the other criminals. The boat was still quite a ways from shore, and Kip couldn't tell what they were lining up for until he felt another stiff push behind him and the cold water hit like needles in his skin. He quickly surfaced and saw others fall in after him, some of them struggling to stay afloat. But he didn't have the strength to help them - he had to swim.

The cold turned into numbness as he kept his head above water and swam his hardest toward the shore. The wind was strongly against him and toward Ara, and was kicking up a current that would push him back if he stopped, but his efforts were focused on getting to shore, and he had purged his mind of all other worries in order to survive. He felt a tug at his leg in the middle of an exhale and he went under while another person clambered over his submerged back and jumped forward, leaving him disoriented and deprived of oxygen. He panicked and flailed around in the water until he felt his feet touch something solid. The water wasn't so deep here, he must be close. He dug his toes into the pebble bed and powered back to the surface to resume his swim to shore. When he made it to standing depth, he stopped to catch his breath while he looked for other people make it ashore. He spotted a young and very thin maman whose muscles were locking up in the cold. A surge of urgency rushed through him, and he swam back out to hae. Kip latched hae arms to his shoulders while he swam backward to shore, making sure both of their heads were above water. Hae lips were turning blue and hae muscles relaxed again before Kip could make it back.

"Come on. Stay awake, kid," he said, but the maman was unresponsive.

Once they got ashore, Kip searched for a pulse and didn't feel one.

"Shit. No no no. Don't die."

He quickly dug a small trench in the pebbles to insulate them while he used his body heat to warm hae. He crossed his arms in front of hae and pulled down in an effort to re-start hae hearts. The others gathered around them to watch what was happening.

"The fire. We have to get hae to the fire," called a man from the crowd.

"That's at least an arc-minute away," said a woman.

"Well this isn't working," the man responded.

Kip butted in, "It will take too long to get there. Thi'll be dead by the time we start running."

The crowd paused, and then a woman spoke up, "Everyone gather kindling from the treeline. We'll start a fire here."

They sprung into action while the woman rushed over to Kip, still pushing on the child's hearts.

She said, "I'm Cas, a doctor from Shaki. I can take over if you're tired."

Kip responded between pushes. "Thank you...shouldn't...stop". Cas understood and started digging a pit in the pebbles near the two to construct a fire. The people had started to bring small twigs and place them in the pit while Cas stood them to form a cone. Suddenly, a cough was heard and the people turned to find the child moving.

"You're alive!" Kip said, jubilant.

Cas reset her focus and produced two steel bits and a still-dry notebook from a peculiar bag at her waist. She took a large rock in her shaking hands and started crashing it into the steel above the paper while the people crowded around to shield her from the wind. A maman sat down beside her and started doing the same with the other bit and another piece of paper until they both started seeing smoke. The crowd hollered at the smell: a hint of warmth to come. Kip carefully moved the child toward where the kindling was placed and set hae down on his lap. The others started bring small dry leaves to the two sparkers who were making good progress on smoldering paper.


Meanwhile Kip was trying to talk to the child to keep hae awake and aware.

"Hey, what's your name?"

"Wh-w-w..wha."

"Hey, you're ok now. We made it to shore."

"m-m-mh."

Kip kept his arms and legs wrapped around the child while the smolders turned to flames and then to fire and hae shivers settled. The whole group was gathered around the fire now, introducing themselves to each other while Cas remained close to Kip and the child.

Cas noticed that Kip was getting sleepy, and said, "Hey, why don't you rest your arms. I can take care of hae."

He said, "Ok," and gently laid the child into Cas's arms before leaning over and falling asleep next to her. Cas briefly looked at him admiringly, as if to wonder how such a good heart wound up in such a miserable place, but she remembered that all hearts have a dark side, including her own.

---

Kip woke up in the darkness, cold from the lack of a fire and clothes that were still a bit damp. He rolled over to see Cas asleep behind him and the child, still breathing. *What time of day is it? Can hardly tell in the eternal twilight here*. But his belly grumbled and told him it had been at least a va'la. *We aren't going to survive out here long unless we find a food source*. He sat up and searched the fire for enough heat to rekindle from. He was satisfied that it was possible, and then took some thicker branches from the pile they built when they arrived to re-stoke the fire, saving one for his makeshift torch.
