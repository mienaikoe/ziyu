## Chapter 8


The ship to Ulu's shadestead looked like it was made by a generation of Throngia no longer living, and instead of being repaired correctly it was patched up with scrap boards and bent nails. Kip was used to bikes and trains: the vehicles of the land, not this ever-rocking monstrosity. But the trip wasn't long, and he might have believed he deserved punishment if he thought about it long enough. The captain was a tall, muscular woman by the name of Zaenta, or at least that's what he thought he overheard the escort call her. The ship had only a few exiles aboard, but each was accompanied by an escort. Most of them seemed mentally detached - either addicted to kanosin or just plain depressed. One was just a maman child, with clear signs of withdraw. *These people need medical help. Ulu will only make them worse.*

After a few va'ma, they came near to a large island with tall trees and a bright bonfire roaring quite a way from the shore. The dimness of the sky made it feel like the end of the day, but they hadn't gone far. They could still see the outskirts of Shaki from across the sea. Kip's escort unchained his arms and shoved him to get in a line along the side of the boat with the others. The boat was still quite a ways from shore, and Kip couldn't tell what they were lining up for until he felt another stiff push behind him and the cold water hit like needles in his skin. He quickly surfaced and saw others fall in after him, some of them struggling to stay afloat. But he didn't have the strength to help them - he had to swim.

The cold turned into numbness as he kept his head above water and swam his hardest toward the shore. The wind was strongly against him and toward Ara, and was kicking up a current that would push him back if he stopped, but his efforts were focused on getting to shore, and he had purged his mind of all other worries in order to survive. He felt a tug at his leg in the middle of an exhale and he went under while another person clambered over his submerged back and jumped forward, leaving him disoriented and deprived of oxygen. He panicked and flailed around in the water until he felt his feet touch something solid. The water wasn't so deep here, he must be close. He dug his toes into the pebble bed and powered back to the surface to resume his swim to shore. When he made it to standing depth, he stopped to catch his breath while he looked for other people make it ashore. He spotted a young and very thin maman whose muscles were locking up in the cold. A surge of urgency rushed through him, and he swam back out to hae. Kip latched hae arms to his shoulders while he swam backward to shore, making sure both of their heads were above water. Hae lips were turning blue and hae muscles relaxed again before Kip could make it back.

"Come on. Stay awake, kid," he said, but the maman was unresponsive.

Once they got ashore, Kip searched for a pulse and didn't feel one.

"Shit. No no no. Don't die."

He quickly dug a small trench in the pebbles to insulate them while he used his body heat to warm hae. He crossed his arms in front of hae and pulled down in an effort to re-start hae hearts. The others gathered around them to watch what was happening.

"The fire. We have to get hae to the fire," called a man from the crowd.

"That's thousands of paces away," said a woman.

"Well this isn't working," the man responded.

Kip butted in, "It will take too long to get there. Thi'll be dead by the time we start running."

The crowd paused, and then a woman spoke up, "Everyone gather kindling from the forest. We'll start a fire here."

Those who were able sprung into action while the woman rushed over to Kip, still pushing on the child's hearts.

She said, "I'm Cas, a doctor from Shaki. I can take over if you're tired."

Kip responded between pushes. "Thank you...shouldn't...stop". Cas understood and started digging a pit in the pebbles near the two to construct a fire. The others had started to bring small twigs and place them in the pit while Cas stood them to form a cone. Suddenly, a cough was heard and all turned to find the child moving.

"You're alive!" Kip said, jubilant.

Cas reset her focus and produced two steel bits and a still-dry notebook from a peculiar bag at her waist. She took a large rock in her shaking hands and started crashing it into the steel above the paper while the people crowded around to shield her from the wind. A maman sat down beside her and started doing the same with the other bit and another piece of paper until they both started seeing smoke. The crowd hollered at the smell: a hint of warmth to come. Kip carefully moved the child toward where the kindling was placed and set hae down on his lap. The others started bring small dry leaves to the two sparkers who were making good progress on smoldering paper.

Meanwhile Kip was trying to talk to the child to keep hae awake and aware.

"Hey, what's your name?"

"m-m-mh."

"Hey, you're ok now. We made it to shore."

Kip kept his arms and legs wrapped around the child while the smolders turned to flames and then to fire and hae shivers settled. The whole group was huddled closely around the fire now, some napping to regain their strength they had just encountered while Cas remained close to Kip and the child.

"Colder than I thought it would be," she tried to make small talk.

Kip paused, wondering if he should mention the obstruction.

She changed the subject, "I didn't get your name earlier."

Kip responded, relieved, "I'm Kip. A doctor from Heiko."

"Two doctors in Ulu. What are the odds?"

He smiled abruptly to himself - he was pondering the same thing.

He asked her, "So, Cas, how did you wind up here?"

"I'd prefer to ask you first. Anxiety."

"Well. I pinned a guy against a wall who wanted to send my spouse to space."

She laughed until she noticed that he wasn't.

"Oh. That... must be a long story."

"It is."

Kip felt a sense of longing for Lif and Mel, but then realized he was being too cold. "It's a story best told in the light."

"I see."

"So how about you? Hope it's a bit less complicated."

"It's...well I suppose it's also a story for the mainland."

"Sure."

She noticed that Kip was getting sleepy and whispered to him, "Hey, why don't you rest your arms. I can take care of hae."

He nodded and gently laid the child into Cas's arms before leaning over and falling asleep next to her. Cas briefly looked at him admiringly, as if to wonder how such a good heart wound up in such a miserable place, but she remembered that all hearts have a dark side, including her own.

---

Kip woke up in the darkness, cold from the lack of a fire and clothes that were still a bit damp. He rolled over to see Cas asleep behind him and the child, still breathing. *What time of day is it? Can hardly tell in the eternal twilight here*. But his belly grumbled and told him it had been at least a va'la. *We aren't going to survive out here long unless we find a food source*. He sat up and searched the fire for a flame to rekindle from, and then took some thicker branches from the pile to re-stoke the fire, saving a handful of thinner ones for his makeshift torch. The darkness was something he had anticipated, but he had never planned for the difficulties of surviving in the wild. The stories of the Shadestead had always painted to him a picture of a large prison, not a lawless forest island. But now wasn't the time to be frustrated about the past; he carried the light into the towering forest, determined to uncover its mysteries and secure nourishment for his new group.

The forest floor was covered with dried thin leaves and branches that had fallen from the canopy. Kip listened closely for signs of life as he tried his best to quiet his crunching underfoot. This was not a place for Throngia. There were no shrubs to forage, no fruiting clusters in sight, no animals scurrying up and down trees or whistling upon the air. It was unsettlingly silent. He cleared a patch of ground looking for anything that might have fallen, but only tree roots and compacted leaves appeared.

"There was a bonfire when we came in. That must be from the other exiles. They must have food somehow," he said to himself. His memory of where the fire was foggy but he set out in the direction of Ulu, where he presumed the center of the island to be.

He came to a small clearing in the trees where he noticed specific markings at the base of a very large branch. They were thin rings of copper running around the branches, oxidized by salt water in the air. Their bends and cruves resembled some sort of language that wasn't based on anything Throngian. He stopped to study them, running his hands and fingers against the wires. In the silence and intense concentration, he started to hear a faint static ticking noise as if it were coming from inside his head.

"Are you lost?" A voice suddenly called out.

He turned around to find the child following his footsteps.

"You've been following me?"

"Yes. They know you're here."

"Who?"

"The other exiles. They know the schedule. They wait for you to starve and then come to collect you when you're weak."

"How do you know all this?"

"I've been here three times."

Kip was aghast imagining what this child's life might be like.

"Where are your parents?"

"My mother lives on the mainland. My nather lives here now."

"Lives here? What do you mean?"

"Her first sentence was for one ma'to. After her return, she just wanted to go back to the shadestead. Now her sentence is for life."

"And your father?"

Thi hesitated. "He's the reason my nather is here."

He understood.

Crouching down to hae level, he asked, "What is your name?"

Thi hesitated again but quickly turned hae attention to something behind Kip. He turned around quickly with his torch held high and caught the nose of a woman, covered with blue luminescent flow tattoos, and a spear in her hand as tall as she was. She grunted with fury at the fire, and yanked the torch from Kip's grasp with ease. Kip began to run, but between the child and the darkness, he couldn't find his way and tripped on a root after only a few steps. The woman tossed the torch down in front of her and walked toward them, crushing the torch's fire under her bare foot.

She lifted the child up to stand and said, "Thank you for distracting this one. Run off now to your nather," she said with a peculiar accent.

"Yes, Setre", Wan said, as he ran to the camp leaving Kip behind.

"As for you... You're a rebellious one. And pretty sexy. We save the best jobs for people like you."

Kip tried to stand up, but Setre drew her spear at him and shouted, "Running is futile. Trust me, nobody here wants you dead."

She pulled Kip up by the shirt like he was nothing more than a tree branch and looked him in the eye. The luminescent ink in her skin was reflecting off of Kip's terrified face and illuminating her own.

"They like their prey alive."
