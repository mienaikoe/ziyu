## Chapter 26

Pomri's lantern illuminated a heavily damaged sign beside the path. _eik...servato... Ara_

She looked it over in detail and said, "looks like it's far enough from the city that the explosion left it intact for the most part."

"I've been here before," I said, remembering bits and pieces from that night.

"Melna mentioned that she found you somewhere around here."

I only spoke when I knew something, and there was very little for me to speak of.

She approached the sign and said, "before we go,"

With one hand, she broke off the long piece of wood that said "Ara" and cut it into a thinner piece with the blade of her spear, making sure to smooth out any potential splinters or hanging sharp bits.

"Use this for stability," she said, holding one of the pieces out to me. I took it in my hands and looked for the word. It too, had been smoothed out.

"Come on," she said. "The quicker we move, the quicker we rest."

My legs ached twice as much when I presented them with the idea of walking upward, but I regaled them with thoughts of chairs and beds and we reached a arrangement.

The hill was dead save for a few blots of shrubbery that grew in the crevasses facing Ara. They were on their way out. It was the absence of wind is what took me by surprise. No cold bites or violent gusts. Just stagnant air and the dust that hung upon it. I followed behind Pomri, using her as my motivation to push through the aches in my legs and feet.

Halfway to the top, Pomri's lantern started to flicker and fade.

"Ay. Damn this thing," she said, holding it up in her right hand. "Never enough fuel."

I ran to approach her, aware of the danger darkness would have on this hill if I was alone. She looked at me as if she was surprised and slowed her pace, expressionless, but perhaps I moved her to slow.
