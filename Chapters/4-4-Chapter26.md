Ahead and above in the distance, I heard the cries of a man, interspersed with fits of coughing â€“ an even split of the two. At first I thought my ears betrayed me, but as we approached, the sound grew in volume. I traced it to a direction nearer Ara and took off. Pomri was behind me screaming "Wait!" but I did not stop.

The ground began to absolutely teem with rocks as it sloped upward. _This hill wasn't here before. Heiko is a flat grassland._ I reached a point where the rocks continued but the land leveled off again. A few paces away, I saw him through the dust. He knealt with his hands behind his head, nodding his torso back and forth. I came to him, yelling, "Aey-o. you alright?" but suddenly a rock below me gave way, and I stumbled. My reflexes lurched my hands towards the closest rocks, scraping them as they clambered for a solid grasp. Below me was a sudden drop and a black void. Its depth was unknowable, but I knew I would certainly die if I let go now.

"Got you," she said, grasping my wrist. "What are you thinking running off in the dark like that?"

My breath and my words were paused in shock as she pulled me back onto the clifftop.

"We've reached the crater. Try your best not to fall into it again."

As I caught my breath, I shushed Pomri to listen for the sounds of the man that led me here. Still he was crying, close to us yet unaware of me or Pomri.

"Who's there?" she asked harshly. But he didn't respond. She approached the sound carefully.

"Speak!" she tried being demanding, but still he didn't respond.

She laid a hand on his shoulder and he panicked, stumbling on himself and wheezing heavily as he backed away. His eyes were bloodshot, and his face caked with black ash.

"I have nothing to give you," he said staring at her feet. "Take my life or leave me to my grief," he said.

"Jesse? Is that you?"

He remained there, motionless, fighting back a cough and holding his hand to the back of his head.

"How did you survive?"

But still he did not move.

"He can't hear you," I chimed.

Pomri glanced back at me, apprehensive. Instead of fighting with her, I approached him slowly and held out my hand, to which he responded with his own. Upon his palm, I placed a finger and drew the words I wanted to say. _L-I-N-Y-U_, first, and then pointed to myself. Then _P-O-M-R-I_. His eyes lit up ever so slightly as if he knew that name, but he didn't look in her direction, only at me.

"I know Pomri. She warned us early. Got most of us out."

It occured to me that he may not yet have realized that he had gone deaf and partially blind.

"Ask him what happened," Pomri asked.

_W-H-A-T-H-A-P-P-_, he paused me, signaling that he understood.

"I was at the observatory when Holragi landed. Thimlu had a message he wanted to send, that he entrusted me to bring wherever you were going. But I didn't make it, did I?... That's okay though, because now you're here."

"That's great, Jesse," said Pomri, "What was the message?"

_W-H-A-_

"...I...I can't remember."

"You can't remember?"

She stooped down, holding the lantern to her face so he could read her lips.

"Try to remember," she demanded.

"I can't remember!" he cried. "I can't...my..."

His pupils began to constrict and we watched as his mind began to slip backward in time.

"Wait... who are you?... I have nothing to give you. Go away!"

He turned and shuffled away from us with his hand still holding the back of his head. With a fit, he coughed loudly as if he had been struggling to hold it in. Black mucus appeared on his hand.

"Leave me be," he said to us.

We stood there for a while, letting go of him and his fate. Then Pomri interjected, "Let's go," and took off toward Ulu. I lingered, though I knew it was impossible to help. I couldn't will myself to let him go. A hand rested on my shoulder and broke me from my trance.

_I need to get moving_

My legs began to move, but I was still in my mind, helplessly grasping at a thousand failures to help. Before the dust swallowed him, I looked back at his ashen face, and internalized the broken person that I saw there. And I promised myself never to forget.
