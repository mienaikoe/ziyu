## Chapter 26

The light in Pomri's hand illuminated a heavily damaged sign beside the path. _eik...servato... Ara_

She looked it over in detail and said, "looks like it's far enough from the city that the explosion left it intact for the most part."

"I've been here before," I said, remembering bits and pieces from that night.

"Melna mentioned that she found you somewhere around here."

I only spoke when I knew something, and there was very little for me to speak of.

She approached the sign and said, "before we go,"

With one hand, she broke off the long piece of wood that said "Ara" and cut it into a thinner piece with the blade of her spear, making sure to smooth out any potential splinters or hanging sharp bits.

"Use this for stability," she said, holding one of the pieces out to me. I took it in my hands and looked for the word. It too, had been smoothed out.

"Come on," she said. "The quicker we move, the quicker we rest."

My legs ached twice as much when I presented them with the idea of walking upward, but I regaled them with thoughts of chairs and beds and we reached a arrangement.

The mountain was dead save for a few blots of shrubbery that grew in the crevasses facing Ara. They were on their way out. It was the absence of wind is what took me by surprise. No cold bites or violent gusts. Just stagnant air and the dust that hung upon it. I followed behind Pomri, using her as my motivation to push through the aches in my legs and feet.

I was the first to hear the cries of a man in the distance, interspersed with fits of coughing. At first I thought my ears betrayed me, but as we approached, the sound grew in volume. Instinctively, I took off after the sound. Pomri was behind me screaming "Wait!" but I did not stop. It was merely a few paces before I saw him through the dust, knealing with his hands behind his head, nodding his torso back and forth. I came to him, yelling, "Aey. you alright?" but suddenly a rock below me gave way. My reflexes lurched my hands towards the closest bit of land, scraping my hands as they clambered for a solid grasp. I looked below me at a black void, its depth was unknowable, but I knew I would certainly die if I let go.

"Got you," she said, grasping my wrist. "What are you thinking running off in the dark like that?"

My breath and my words were still recovering as she pulled me back onto the clifftop, but once I had a moment I shushed Pomri to listen for the sounds of the man that led me here. Still he was crying, close to us yet unaware of me or Pomri.

"Who's there?" she asked harshly, covering her illuminated leg and hand. But he didn't respond. Carefully, she approached the sound, signalling for me to follow.

"Speak!" she tried being demanding, but still he didn't respond.

She laid a hand on his shoulder and he panicked, stumbling on himself and wheezing heavily as he backed away. His eyes were bloodshot, and his face caked with black ash.

"I have nothing to give you," he said staring at her feet. "Take my life or leave me to my grief," he said.

"Jesse? Is that you?"

He remained there, motionless, fighting back a cough and holding his hand to the back of his head.

"How did you survive?"

But still he did not move.

"He can't hear you," I chimed.

Pomri glanced back at me, apprehensive. Instead of fighting with her, I approached him slowly and held out my hand, to which he responded with his own. Upon his palm, I placed a finger and drew the words I wanted to say. _L-I-N-Y-U_, first, and then pointed to myself. Then _P-O-M-R-I_. His eyes lit up ever so slightly as if he knew that name, but he didn't look in her direction, only at me.

"I know Pomri. She warned us early. Got most of us out."

It occured to me that he may not yet have realized that he had gone deaf and partially blind.

"Ask him what happened," Pomri asked.

_W-H-A-T-H-A-P-P-_, he paused me, signaling that he understood.

"I was at the observatory when Holragi landed. I had a message to send; a message of great importance. But I didn't make it, did I?... That's okay though, because now you're here."

"That's great, Jesse," said Pomri, "What was the message?"

_W-H-A-_

"...I...I can't remember."

"You can't remember?"

She stooped down, holding the lantern to her face so he could read her lips.

"Try to remember," she demanded.

"I can't remember!" he cried. "I can't...my..."

His pupils began to constrict and we watched as his mind began to slip backward in time.

"Wait... who are you?... I have nothing to give you. Go away!"

He turned and shuffled away from us with his hand still holding the back of his head. With a fit, he coughed loudly as if he had been struggling to hold it in. Black mucus appeared on his hand.

"Leave me be," he said to us.

We stood there for a while, letting go of him and his fate. Then Pomri interjected, "Let's go," and took off toward Ulu. I lingered, though I knew it was impossible to help. I couldn't will myself to let him go. A hand rested on my shoulder and broke me from my trance.

_I need to get moving_

<!-- Wait, but why? Wouldn't they try to help him along a bit more? -->

My legs began to move, but I was still in my mind, helplessly grasping at a thousand failures to help. Before the dust swallowed him, I looked back at his ashen face, and internalized the broken person that I saw there. And I promised myself never to forget.
