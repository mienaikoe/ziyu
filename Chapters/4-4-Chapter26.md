## Chapter 26

The blue light in Pomri's hand illuminated a heavily damaged sign beside the path. _eik...servato... Ara_

She looked it over in detail and said, "looks like it's far enough from the city that the explosion left it intact for the most part."

"I've been here before," I said, remembering bits and pieces from the night I was found.

"Melna mentioned that she found you somewhere around here."

She approached the sign and prefaced her actions

"Before we go..."

With one hand, she broke off the long piece of wood that said _eik_ and cut it into a thinner piece with the blade of her spear, making sure to smooth out any potential splinters or hanging sharp bits.

"Use this for stability," she said, holding one of the pieces out to me. I took it in my hands and looked for the word. It too, had been smoothed out.

"Come on," she said. "The quicker we move, the quicker we rest."

My legs ached twice as much when I presented them with the idea of walking upward, but I regaled them with thoughts of chairs and beds and we reached a arrangement.

The mountain was dead save for a few blots of shrubbery that grew in the crevasses facing Ara. They were on their way out. It was the absence of wind is what took me by surprise. No cold bites or violent gusts. Just stagnant air and the dust that hung upon it. I followed behind Pomri, using her as my motivation to push through the aches in my legs and feet.

In the distance, the cries of a man in distress resounded against the mountain wall, interspersed with fits of coughing. I looked to Pomri, who hadn't heard anything, and at first I thought my ears betrayed me. But as we approached, the sound grew in volume and I was compelled by instinct to find the source and help. Pomri was behind me screaming "Wait!" but I did not stop. It was merely a lao'ta before I saw him through the dust, knealing with his hands behind his head and nodding his torso back and forth. I came upon him, yelling, "Aey. you alright?" but there was no answer. It was no longer clear if he was laughing or crying.

I illuminated his figure with the light of my legs. Deep scrapes and cuts marred his clothes and skin. Some were superficial, but most showed signs of blood loss. His eyes were bloodshot, and his face caked with black ash. It took him a moment to stop his nodding and realize a presence.

Through trembling lips, he stammered, "W...Who..?" but his eyes only fixated on the light. Suddenly, his hands lurched forward and grasped my ankles tightly. A reflex jolted me backward, falling to the ground, with half of my body hanging over a cliff, my hands scraping and clambering for a solid bit of land. I looked below me into a black void, its depth was unknowable, but I knew I would certainly die if he let go.

"DIE HOLRAGI!" He roared at me as he pushed my legs and let go. For a single point in time, I hung in the air, the assurance of death nestling me to its bosom. I knew this feeling when my legs went numb in the waters of Ulukoma. When I first experienced Kanosin as a curious child in my mother's bedroom. It was familiar, neither friend nor enemy. More of a conjuring, an apparition that revealed itself from time to time. But then each time a hand reached out, pulling me from the figment of death. Setre, Kipnu.

This time it was Pomri, grasping my wrist just in time. She barely exerted herself pulling me up with one arm, and quickly pivoting to restrain the mysterious man. She grappled him by his arm and he panicked, stumbling on himself and wheezing heavily as he tried to get away.

"Speak!" she demanded, but still he didn't respond.

"I have nothing to give you," he said staring at her feet. "Take my life or leave me to my suffering," he said.

"Jesse?" she asked, bewildered at seeing his face again, "Is that you?"

He remained there, motionless, fighting back a cough and holding his right hand to the back of his head.

"How did you survive?"

But still he did not move.

"He can't hear you," I chimed.

Pomri glanced back at me, apprehensive. Instead of fighting with her, I approached him slowly and held out my hand, to which he responded with his own. Upon his palm, I placed a finger and drew the words I wanted to say. _L-I-N-Y-U_, first, and then pointed to myself. Then _P-O-M-R-I_. His eyes lit up ever so slightly as if he knew that name, but he didn't look in her direction, only at me.

"I know Pomri. She warned us early. Got most of us out."

"Jesse... how did?" Pomri said. She was moved to tears.

It occured to me that he may not yet have realized that he had gone deaf and partially blind.

"Ask him what happened," Pomri asked.

_W-H-A-T-H-A-P-P-_, he paused me, signaling that he understood.

"I was at the observatory when–," he winced at some pain in his body. "...when Holragi landed. I had a message to send; a message of great importance. But I didn't make it, did I?... That's okay though, because now you're here."

"That's great, Jesse," said Pomri, "What was the message?"

_W-H-A-T-W-A-S-M-E-S_

"The message?...The message..."

"You can't remember?" said Pomri, urgently.

She moved closer to him, holding the illuminated hand to her face so he could read her lips.

"Try to remember," she demanded.

"I can't remember!" he cried. "I can't...can't..."

His pupils began to constrict and I watched as his mind began to slip backward in time.

"Just try, Jesse."

"Who are you?!... I have nothing to give you – go away!"

He turned and shuffled away from us with his hand still holding the back of his head. A fit of violent coughing overcame him as if he had been struggling to hold it in and he was forced to rest against the mountainside to regain his breath, still holding his free hand out to ward us off.

"Leave me be," he begged, almost whispering.

Pomri was insistent. She approached him, trying to reassure him that she was not there for malice. But he refused her, curling up into himself. With each refusal, she broke down a little bit more until she finally knealt before him and wept. At a safe distance, he resumed his nodding and gesticulating, a hand still behind his head.

I knealt near Pomri a while with my hand on her back, imagining the kind of man he might have been, who he might have loved. I didn't know Jesse, but Pomri seemed to hold him in high regard.

"There is no justice to deliver," she said under her breath. "No greater good that could ever make this right."

I could feel the weight of her words stirring the same fire and vitriol that she felt in her own heart. If this was the end of life on Palinan, we would not surely not go out as a flickering flame, but as frozen statues on a battlefield of our creation.

Then Pomri asked me, "Linyu. Do you have any more kanosin?"

I hesitated, confused for a moment. Then realizing her plan, I produced a vial without word or question and filled my syringe with it. She tore off a large piece of her guard trousers, exposing more of the leg she had illuminated, and wiped it clean from ash. With little difficulty she bound his arms behind him and laid him on the ground, elevating his head with her satchel below his neck. He was not fighting now. Perhaps he had come to accept his anticipated death. She accepted the syringe from my hand reluctantly, but perhaps she understood now the limits of law.

"The left heart," I said, reassuringly. "Directly in."

She nodded, doing exactly as I said. Jesse's eyes began to fizzle, and his muscles relaxed.

Pomri stood up, interjecting, "Let's go." I followed her toward the observatory, but lingered on the sight of Jesse. I couldn't will myself to let him go. But a hand rested on my shoulder and softened my mental petrifaction. Below me, the ground was passing, but in my mind I was still there, helplessly grasping at a thousand failures to help him. Before the dust separated us, I looked back at his nodding silhouette, recalled his phantom pains and ashen face. I internalized the broken man. And I promised myself never to forget.

We decided to be polite for some reason, knowing full well the building was empty. Pomri jostled the wooden entry bell and called out at the door, but there was no answer, as expected. Aside from her,
