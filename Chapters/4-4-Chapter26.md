## Chapter 26

Pomri's lantern illuminated a heavily damaged sign beside the path. _eik...servato... Ara_

She looked it over in detail and said, "looks like it's far enough from the city that the explosion left it intact for the most part."

"I've been here before," I said, remembering bits and pieces from that night.

"Melna mentioned that she found you somewhere around here."

I only spoke when I knew something, and there was very little for me to speak of.

She approached the sign and said, "before we go,"

With one hand, she broke off the long piece of wood that said "Ara" and cut it into a thinner piece with the blade of her spear, making sure to smooth out any potential splinters or hanging sharp bits.

"Use this for stability," she said, holding one of the pieces out to me. I took it in my hands and looked for the word. It too, had been smoothed out.

"Come on," she said. "The quicker we move, the quicker we rest."

My legs ached twice as much when I presented them with the idea of walking upward, but I regaled them with thoughts of chairs and beds and we reached a arrangement.

The mountain was dead save for a few blots of shrubbery that grew in the crevasses facing Ara. They were on their way out. It was the absence of wind is what took me by surprise. No cold bites or violent gusts. Just stagnant air and the dust that hung upon it. I followed behind Pomri, using her as my motivation to push through the aches in my legs and feet.

Halfway to the top, Pomri's lantern started to flicker and fade.

"Ay. Damn this thing," she said, holding it up in her right hand. "Never enough fuel."

I ran to approach her, aware of my dependence on her guidance. She looked at me as if she was surprised and slowed her pace, expressionless, but perhaps a I struck one of her hearts. I barely saw her face before the lantern fizzled out and we were stuck in the muddy twilight, unable to see where the path ended and where it began.

"I am not wasting my life because of a damn lantern," she said, setting it down harshly. I could tell she wanted to toss it down the mountain, but she settled for staring at it in angry deliberation. My own deliberations were fixated on a few glass ampules and a syringe in a small writers bag in my satchel. I wasn't sure if this was the best use for them or what Pomri would think, but somehow I found the bag in my hands anyway holding them out for Pomri to feel for.

"What is this?"

"Kanosin."

"Oi put that away! What would you bring something like that out here for?"

"It can light the way."

"What are you on about now?"

She watched patiently as I pulled an ampule and neatly injected it into the hydroderm on my left shin. From the point of the syringe the kanosin glowed and permeated the vasculature, filling every water capillary in my entire lower leg with a bright flow tattoo. I fetched another ampule and did the same to my other leg. By the time I finished the entire ground around us was pale blue and I could see Pomri's face in the illumination, wide-eyed and unbelieving.

"W... What is this?"

"My people live in darkness. We had to find some way to see light."

"So you used the same narcotic you use to treat injuries?"

"Kanosin has many uses."

Pomri was confused and apprehensive. She'd only known it as an addictive narcotic, a substance used by lowbrow peddlers and clandestine organizations to coerce the desparate to do their bidding. She was even convinced that Holragi had used it to enslave entire tribes of the desert to work on the spacerail, though few had ever left the project to confirm it. But today, she had seen physicians using it as a life-saving drug, she saw a kaln inject it into hae skin without ill-effects.

"What is Kanosin?" she asked me; almost demanding an answer.

I hesitated, remembering my mother's direction. But I felt that I could trust her.

"It's a chemical harvested from kelp in the volcanic ocean."

"Yes but... what does it do? How does it actually work?"

"It..."

"Go on."

"It reverses death."

Pomri paused, doubtful. "You're saying that this substance literally makes you immortal?"

"Not exactly."

"And you just used it as a flow tattoo?"

"How else would we get up the mountain?"

She held her head in disbelief. "You could have saved countless people with this. Why aren't you sharing it with the world?"

"This world can't be saved. The obscura was a convenient distraction for Holrag. Now they control everything."

She grasped my arm, trying eagerly to be convincing, "Who are you to judge the future of the world? There are people in Rudjan – innocent people – that could be saved from the obscura."

"They can't!" I plead.

"Why not?!"

My face flushed with frustration. I had learned of the world from my parents and all the Ulukomans who told stories than anyone my age ought to have. Even my father knew the dangers of kanosin flooding.

"Ulukomans discussed this long ago and they made up their minds," I said, "Kanosin is far too dangerous to give to the entire world."

"Kanosin is not yours to rule. No one power can be the gatekeeper of life and death."

"That's exactly why we cannot spread it," I said. With a heavy sigh I stood up, sinching my satchel closed, and continued up the path we had been on.

"Where are you going Linyu?"

"To the observatory."

"Fuck the observatory. Whatever Jesse has to say can wait."

I didn't respond. A rock cannot be reasoned with.

"Just like that? You're going to walk away just like that?"

Her voice started to break.

"You could have saved Kipnu! You could have saved Melna!"

"You people are no better than the Holragi!"

My feet took me round a corner where I stopped them and leaned against a tree to calm down. Such words could be taken easily from a stranger, but not from a friend. I opened my hands and looked at the empty ampules. I had found them so often as toddler in Rudjan. My mother was too absent for even her best intentions to manifest. Kanosin had become an enemy. But when I met my nather, I was in awe at the brightly colored flow tattoos on her chest. She told me stories of fetching drowned fishers from the darkest waters, lit only by the light from her skin. She brought their bodies to my mother who cleared the water from their airways and recalled them back to life with kanosin. Eventually, reason would have led me to dismiss these stories, but experience has only reinforced them. I looked down at the bright streaks of kanosin on my legs, and felt no shame. I'd been to that hell and come back alive.

Pomri showed no signs of following me up the hill, so I turned my head upward onto the path to the observatory, and refused to feel alone.
