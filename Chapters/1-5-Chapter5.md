## Chapter 5


The city was carved from the body a long-dead volcano, curled upward as if the land was an ocean wave. Massive veins of white marble meandered between gray, banded rock, striping through the roads and walls like an unmoving spectre casting shadows through time. Every building faced proudly toward Ara, carefully reflecting every glint of orange and red and infrared. High upon the mountain within the largest vein of marble sat the senate, with its crown, a the gilded halo of the Palinian circle. I imagined being one of the people that carved out their piece of the mountain to call home. *It must have taken ages*.

"Been a while, has it?" Fajro said once we got off.

"Yes. At least a few Ma'To."

"Its beauty never changes."

"Even after years of coming here?"

"Every time, it seems like a distant memory. This city changes you the minute you join the throng. Every day here is another lifetime."

"Let's make this one count."

The base of the city was brightly lit, but there were large spots of shade behind giant curved mirrors in the distance. They were continuously focusing and harvesting Ara's light onto pipes of water to deliver steam to all of Shaki. Near the railyard an air of bustle filled the area with hordes of trainferriers bringing cargo to and from the trains; trade scribes in toe trying to keep up.

I helped Fajro walk from the railyard to the easternmost funicular station. It was not terribly distant, but the sluggish pace was wearing thin on the patience of passersby trying to get around us.

"I regret that I am slowing you down," he said, acknowledging his frustration.

"No such talk. These people can afford to slow down a little bit."

"You know, I used to keep pace with the trainferriers before I busted my knee."

"Oh I bet you could run circles around them," I said, trying to lift his spirits a bit.

We rode the funicular up the mountain and toward the Senate. It made several stops along the way, giving us places to stop and marvel at the beauty of the city from above. The public workers with their dusty tunics, the scribes with their ink-blotted fingers, all funneling in and out of the car. Some were carrying their afternoon meal with them as if they had no time to eat. I wondered if they worked through daysleep too. Compartmentalizing my anxiety was proving to be difficult with all the chaos, but I did so in order to see Shaki, possibly for the last time. I did it to remember.

"Senate. Last stop," called the operator.

I helped him off the funicular and he took a seat on the first bench he could find to rest his legs. It was a small public square directly in front of the senate building.

"Ah this brings me back. You see that gate? I used to walk through it every day. I would always round the left corner as I entered from the west. And the steam fountain - Oh I loved to perch on the side of that thing and rake my fingers through the cool mist."

"You sound very fond of this place."

"You could say that. Almost all of my waking life was devoted to this. It really made an impression on me."

"Do you ever miss it?"

"Some parts of it. I felt proud of myself, and all the work that we put in to make big advancements. You know, I was a crucial part of the Holragi Space Rail."

"You were a part of that?"

"Yes I was. I deployed hundreds of public workers to design and survey."

"You must be proud."

"I should be. The scientists who headed the program won't allow me that privelege. They wanted to expand the observer program; to send explorers with telescopes into space to see what we cannot from the surface. By our deadline, we had only built the rail to half of the specified length, so it was only long enough to send lightweight things into orbit. Even the smallest craft they wanted to send would be too heavy."

"That's still quite an accomplishment."

"It's not the accomplishment it was built for."

"Ideas never make it to reality unscathed."

"I suppose," he said, unconvinced. He nodded both in agreement and continued regret.

After a moment wrapping up his thoughts, he put his hands on the bench, "Well, shall we?"


*************


The front gateway was a massive arch built into the five-story building and nearly half the height. The edges were trimmed with two forged iron columns, branching and twisting elegantly into ornate patterns that cast floral shadows against the marble. I felt my jaw tensing up, and my belly was in knots, but I reminded myself of the note, of Jes, and of the Throngia who were counting on me. Turning back was not an option.

We approached the base of the gateway where a male and female guard in woven stranded-steel armor stood in front. "Name and business," the female guard requested in an uninterested tone.

Fajro began, "I am Fajro, retired senator of Holragi. I have been summoned to deliver a message to the Heiko senator that is vital to their deliberations today."

"No one is permitted in the Senate while they are deliberating."

"Yes, I understand. I am delivering it to her assistant."

"She hasn't mentioned this to us."

"Yes. I was summoned by the , as the matter is unexpected and urgent."

She deliberated with her partner, and glanced at me once, sending a shock of worry through my bones. I was getting cold again.

"You are permitted to go, but your attendant cannot come with you."

*NO*

He replied, "My... attendant helps me walk on account of my injured knee. I really can't go anywhere without help these days."

The male guard begrudgingly walked over to me and said, "Open your bag."

I complied and he rummaged for a bit before walking back and giving a hand sign to the other guard. She said, "Go ahead."

The senate grounds were surrounded by the building that the rest of the city called the Senate. It was a massive circle of offices and gates and walkway, its diameter as large as the farmland I worked in Heiko. But the true focus of this place was the deliberation hall: a marble sphere standing proudly in the center, illuminated by the light through Ara's gate. It sat upon a short marble pedastal that seemed too small to be holding so much weight. Between the outer circle and the sphere was a labyrinth of small pools and lines of vegetation that could certainly not live in such a hot and dry place without the constant shade that the perimeter circle granted. At every vertex of the planting lines, a small black iron circle with an engraved crest marked a city that was member to the Shaki Senate. I longed to venture through the plants and learn about them, but dared not draw attention to myself.

Fajro set me back on track, "Perhaps it's best that we head towards the Heiko office so as not to seem suspicious. We'll want to enter through that side anyway."

I remained silent and compliant, too nervous to say anything. We followed the inside of the perimeter circle to the right into the Heiko section, and turned the corner to face the deliberation hall. It was more shaded from this side, but still as radiant as the rest of the city. There were two guards at the doors again with the same woven armor and massive rectangular shields built to repel several people at once.

"How can we get through them?" I asked, feeling doubtful.

"Leave that to me. This is why Kip sent me after all. I'll distract them while you go around and slip through the door."

A pang of anger welled up in me but I kept my eyes faced forward, "What sort of plan is that?"

"Oh I think you'll find I can be very distracting."

"Anyone can be distracting. You're a senator. Why not use that to get me in?"

"The power of law lies in its enforcement. And trust me when I say these guards know enforcement. Not even I can wrest them from their duty to the law."

"Noble. But annoying."

I began to relish in Fajro's slow walking speed, imagining how I might slip by them unnoticed. It seemed impossible but for my shorter stature. There are some perks to being a Maman.

"What shall I do if they notice me?" I asked.

"Keep going. You'll be imprisoned either way."

"That's great to know."

At about ten paces away from the guards one of them called out, "The Deliberation Hall is closed. Turn around."

Fajro didn't stop and kept eye contact with them while they approached. I fell behind a bit, hiding behind him. *What was he going to do?*

The guard called out again, "You two, turn around and go back where you came from!"

Fajro responded to him confidently, "Tinpo, it's been a while, hasn't it."

"I'm not telling you again. Turn back."

"What sort of welcome is this? You don't recognize your uncle anymore?"

"... Fajro? What are you doing here?" The guard called out and stopped.

*The guard is his nephew?!*

Fajro stopped in front of Tinpo and looked him up and down.

"Tinpo, you make a fine guard," he said.

"Thank you uncle," he rested his stance and smiled a little bit.

"How long have you been posted here? I haven't heard from your parents since I left Holragi."

"They posted me near the railyards immediately after you referred me, but I've been working my way up here ever since."

"Congratulations, my boy. It's only been a few Ma'To, that's quite an achievement."

"Thank you, sir."

"And who's your friend over here? I must say hello."

"Oh, that's Padji. Thi was posted here around the same time I was."

"You must be good friends. I want to meet hae."

"Oh.. uh sure."

We walked over to where Tinpo had been standing, and just before we got there, Fajro nudged me aside. At first I thought it was an accident because he made it seem that way, but then he stood opposite me and started talking to both of them, shifting their gaze away from the door, and away from me. I saw my moment and quickly tiptoed to the doorway. I lifted the heavy door a bit as I cracked it open: a trick my mother had taught me to stay quiet while we shared a room for sleeping. I slipped inside, and quietly closed it the same way, and then turned to face the most powerful governing body in the world.
