## Chapter 5

The city was carved from the body of a tall mountain, with massive veins of white marble meandering between the gray, banded rock. Every road and every building, once hidden beneath the ground, now faced proudly toward the orange and red and infrared of Ara's light. High upon the mountain's crest was the Senate, carved from the largest vein of marble and crowned in glimmering brass. I imagined being one of the settlers here, washing and cleaving a small piece of rock to make a home. I didn't know much about Shaki then, but I did know that I preferred the soft luxury of grass and kelp to the hard vanity of marble.

"Been a while for you?" Fajro asked me once we'd gotten off the train.

"Yes," I said, in awe at the mess of people scurrying about in the station square. "I haven't been since Melna first became a fidelant."

He was looking up toward the Senate, unmoved by the cacophony of people. "The beauty of Shaki never changes", he said. "In Holrag, we call this place "The diamond of Palinan."

"Even after years of coming here, it hasn't lost its luster?"

"This city changes you the minute your feet hit the marble. Every day here is another lifetime, another chance at winning."

"Winning?" I asked.

"Everyone has their own personal game that makes their life worth living. Like you keeping your bunds together."

"That's not a game," I said. "That's my life."

"What's the difference?"

I walked with Fajro from the train station as he guided us to the closest funicular. All around us, the rocky floor was covered in sand from the desert that lay just outside. Ara was fully above the horizon, and brighter than I'd ever seen it. We would have been sweating from the heat but for the shadows cast by a field of monolithic curved mirrors in the distance. As it was told to me, a pipe stands before each one to make steam for the entire city.

An air of bustle filled the area with hordes of ferriers carrying cargo in and out the trains, trade scribes in toe trying to keep up. Their heads would occasionally turn toward a tall tower some distance in the desert, visible to all the city, where a great spot of light was cast upon the wall. _The timekeeper. I remember now._ But after all my cloud-headed observations, I began to notice that our sluggish pace was wearing thin on everyone trying to get around us.

"I'm slowing you down," said Fajro. "Why don't you go on ahead and I'll catch up with you." There was a puzzling tone in his voice; almost as if he'd become a different person when he stepped off the train.

"Our pace is perfectly fine," I told him. "Besides, we're a team now. Going ahead will get me nowhere."

He paused to look around. "You know, I used to keep pace with the ferriers before I busted my knee."

"Oh I bet you could run circles around them," I said. "I've never seen an exhausted fidelant."

He laughed and said, "The fidelacy is a life dedicated to the pursuit of exhaustion, but none of us would ever dare to show it."

We rode the funicular up the mountain and toward the Senate, making several stops along the way. At each one, I marveled at the beauty of the city from a different angle, and at the people who funneled in and out: the public workers with their dusty canvas tunics, the scribes with their ink-blotted fingers, and the occasional artist lost in thought. Some were carrying their afternoon meal with them as if they had no time to eat, and it made me terribly hungry. But there was no time to eat. I had to prepare for what was to come.

"Senate / Public Square. Last stop," called the operator.

I helped Fajro off the funicular and he took a seat on the first bench he could find to rest his legs. All around the square were pots of dark gray stone filled with clay and desert plants from the east, likely the only things that could grow with in so much light.

"Ah this brings me back," said Fajro. "You see that gate? I used to walk through it every day. I would round the left corner as I entered from the west. And the fountain - Oh I loved to perch on the side of that thing and rake my fingers through the cool mist."

"Sounds like you were very fond of this place."

"You could say that. Almost all of my waking life was spent here. It really made an impression on me."

"Do you ever miss it?"

"Some parts. I felt proud of myself, and all that we accomplished despite our differences. You know, I played a big part in the railway pact."

"You?"

"I brokered a treaty for the tribes of Holragi to work together in building a rail for all the world. It helped us become the manufacturing giant we are today, and led us to create the space rail."

"You must be proud," I said, wanting to change the subject.

"It would be a sin not to be proud. Alas, the scientists who headed the program won't allow me that privilege. They wanted to expand the observer program; to send explorers with telescopes into space to see what can't be seen from the surface. By the end of our agreement, we still could only send lightweight things into orbit. Even the smallest craft they wanted to send would be too heavy."

"Nothing in life goes according to plan," I said. "Even this city, I'm sure, is not what its founders had envisioned."

He feigned agreement with a nod. After a moment wrapping up his thoughts, he put his hands on the bench, "Well, shall we?"

Before us was a massive arch of a gate, tall enough to fit ten of me underneath. Its edges were decorated with black iron strands, branching and twisting elegantly into ornate patterns that resembled kelp under the ocean. At the base of the gateway, a man and a woman stood guard in woven black steel scales.

"Name and business," the woman requested in an uninterested tone. Her Shakii accent was thick with bravado.

With cold hands I reached into my shoulder bag for Thimlu's badge, but before I stammered my plea to their deaf ears Fajro spoke with a voice that carried far more authority than a piece of brass ever could.

"I am Fajro, retired fidelant of Holrag. I have been summoned to deliver a message to the Heiko fidelant that is vital to their deliberations today."

The guard was unmoved. "No one is permitted into the Senate while deliberations are under way. It is an offense toâ€“"

"Yes, I understand. I am delivering this message to her assistant."

"Pomri? She hasn't mentioned this to us."

"I was summoned by the speaker this morning, as the matter is unexpected and urgent."

She deliberated with her partner, and glanced at me once, sending a shock of worry through my bones. I was getting cold again.

"You are permitted to go, but your attendant cannot come with you."

_NO_

He replied, "My attendant helps me walk on account of my injured knee. I could barely walk here without hae help, much less make it to Pomri."

The man glanced at the woman and begrudgingly walked over to me and took my bag off my shoulder. I dared not to protest. He rummaging for a bit before throwing it back at me and waving a hand sign to the other guard. "Make it quick," she snapped.

The senate grounds were surrounded by the building that the rest of the city called the Senate. It was a massive circle of offices and gates and walkway, its diameter as large as the farmland I worked in Heiko. But the true focus of this place was the deliberation hall: a giant marble sphere standing proudly in the center, illuminated by the light through Ara's gate. It sat upon a short marble pedastal that seemed too small to be holding so much weight. Between the outer circle and the sphere was a labyrinth of small pools and lines of vegetation that could certainly not live in such a hot and dry place without the constant shade that the perimeter circle granted. At every vertex of the planting lines, a small black iron circle with an engraved crest marked a city that was member to the Shaki Senate. I longed to venture through the plants and learn about them, but I dared not draw attention to myself.

Fajro set me back on track, "Perhaps it's best that we head towards the Heiko office so as not to seem suspicious. We'll want to enter through that side anyway."

I remained silent and compliant, too nervous to say anything. We followed the inside of the perimeter circle to the right into the Heiko section, and turned the corner to face the deliberation hall. It was more shaded from this side, but still as radiant as the rest of the city. There were two guards at the doors again with the same woven armor and massive rectangular shields built to repel several people at once.

"How can we get through them?" I asked, feeling doubtful.

"Leave that to me. This is why Kipnu sent me after all. I'll distract them while you go around and slip through the door."

A pang of anger welled up in me but I kept my eyes faced forward, "What sort of plan is that?"

"Oh I think you'll find I can be very distracting."

"Anyone can be distracting. You're a fidelant. Why not use that to get me in?"

"The power of law lies in its enforcement. And trust me when I say these guards know enforcement. Not even I can wrest them from their duty to the law."

"Noble. But annoying."

I began to relish in Fajro's slow walking speed, imagining how I might slip by them unnoticed. It seemed impossible but for my shorter stature. There are some perks to being a maman.

"What shall I do if they notice me?" I asked.

"Keep going. You'll be imprisoned either way."

"That's great to know."

At about ten paces away from the guards one of them called out, "The Deliberation Hall is closed. Turn around."

Fajro didn't stop and kept eye contact with them while they approached. I fell behind a bit, hiding behind him. _What was he going to do?_

The guard called out again, "You two, turn around and go back where you came from!"

Fajro responded to him confidently, "Tinpo, it's been a while, hasn't it."

"I'm not telling you again. Turn back."

"What sort of welcome is this? You don't recognize your uncle anymore?"

"... Fajro? What are you doing here?" The guard called out and stopped.

_The guard is his nephew?!_

Fajro stopped in front of Tinpo and looked him up and down.

"Tinpo, you make a fine guard," he said in his schmooziest voice.

"Thank you uncle," he rested his stance and smiled a little bit.

"How long have you been posted here? I haven't heard from your parents since I left Holrag."

"They posted me near the railyards immediately after you referred me, but I've been working my way up here ever since."

"Congratulations, my boy. Reaching this post in such a short time is quite an achievement."

"Thank you, sir."

"And who's your friend over here?" he asked.

"Oh, that's Padji. Thi was posted here around the same time I was."

"You must be good friends. I want to meet hae."

"Oh.. uh sure."

We walked over to where Tinpo had been standing, and just before we got there, Fajro nudged me aside. At first I thought it was an accident because he made it seem that way, but then he stood opposite me and started talking to both of them, shifting their gaze away from the door, and away from me. I saw my moment and quickly tiptoed to the doorway. I lifted the heavy door a bit as I cracked it open: a trick my mother had taught me to stay quiet while we shared a room for sleeping. I slipped inside, and quietly closed it the same way, and then turned to face the most powerful governing body in the world.
