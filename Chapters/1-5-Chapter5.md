## Chapter 5

The city was carved from the body of a tall mountain, with massive veins of white marble meandering between the gray, banded rock. Every road and every building, once hidden beneath the ground, now faced proudly toward the orange and red and infrared of Ara's light. High upon the mountain's crest was the Senate, carved from the largest vein of marble and crowned in glimmering brass. I imagined being one of the settlers here, washing and cleaving a small piece of rock to make a home. I didn't know much about Shaki then, but I did know that I preferred the soft luxury of grass and kelp to the hard vanity of marble.

"Been a while for you?" Fajro asked me once we'd gotten off the train.

"Yes," I said, in awe at the mess of people scurrying about in the station square. "I haven't been since Melna first became a fidelant."

He was looking up toward the Senate, unmoved by the cacophony of people. "The beauty of Shaki never changes", he said. "In Holrag, we call this place "The diamond of Palinan."

"Even after years of coming here, it hasn't lost its luster?"

"This city changes you the minute your feet hit the marble. Every day here is another lifetime, another chance at winning."

"Winning?" I asked.

"Everyone has their own personal game that makes their life worth living. Like you keeping your bunds together."

"That's not a game," I said. "That's my life."

"What's the difference?"

I walked with Fajro from the train station as he guided us to the closest funicular. All around us, the rocky floor was covered in sand from the desert that lay just outside. Ara was fully above the horizon, and brighter than I'd ever seen it. We would have been sweating from the heat but for the shadows cast by a field of monolithic curved mirrors in the distance. As it was told to me, a pipe stands before each one to make steam for the entire city.

An air of bustle filled the area with hordes of ferriers carrying cargo in and out the trains, trade scribes in toe trying to keep up. Their heads would occasionally turn toward a tall tower some distance in the desert, visible to all the city, where a great spot of light was cast upon the wall. _The timekeeper. I remember now._ But after all my cloud-headed observations, I began to notice that our sluggish pace was wearing thin on everyone trying to get around us.

"I'm slowing you down," said Fajro. "Why don't you go on ahead and I'll catch up with you." There was a puzzling tone in his voice; almost as if he'd become a different person when he stepped off the train.

"Our pace is perfectly fine," I told him. "Besides, we're a team now. Going ahead will get me nowhere."

He paused to look around. "You know, I used to keep pace with the ferriers before I busted my knee."

"Oh I bet you could run circles around them," I said. "I've never seen an exhausted fidelant."

He laughed and said, "The fidelacy is a life dedicated to the pursuit of exhaustion, but none of us would ever dare to show it."

We rode the funicular up the mountain and toward the Senate, making several stops along the way. At each one, I marveled at the beauty of the city from a different angle, and at the people who funneled in and out: the public workers with their dusty canvas tunics, the scribes with their ink-blotted fingers, and the occasional artist lost in thought. Some were carrying their afternoon meal with them as if they had no time to eat, and it made me terribly hungry. But there was no time to eat. I had to prepare for what was to come.

"Senate / Public Square. Last stop," called the operator.

I helped Fajro off the funicular and he took a seat on the first bench he could find to rest his legs. All around the square were pots of dark gray stone filled with clay and desert plants from the east, likely the only things that could grow with in so much light.

"Ah this brings me back," said Fajro. "You see that gate? I used to walk through it every day. I would round the left corner as I entered from the west. And the fountain - Oh I loved to perch on the side of that thing and rake my fingers through the cool mist."

"Sounds like you were very fond of this place."

"You could say that. Almost all of my waking life was spent here. It really made an impression on me."

"Do you ever miss it?"

"Some parts. I felt proud of myself, and all that we accomplished despite our differences. You know, I played a big part in the railway pact."

"You?"

"I brokered a treaty for the tribes of Holragi to work together in building a rail for all the world. It helped us become the manufacturing giant we are today, and led us to create the space rail."

"You must be proud," I said, wanting to change the subject.

"It would be a sin not to be proud. Alas, the scientists who headed the program won't allow me that privilege. They wanted to expand the observer program; to send explorers with telescopes into space to see what can't be seen from the surface. By the end of our agreement, we still could only send lightweight things into orbit. Even the smallest craft they wanted to send would be too heavy."

"Nothing in life goes according to plan," I said. "Even this city, I'm sure, is not what its founders had envisioned."

He feigned agreement with a nod. After a moment wrapping up his thoughts, he put his hands on the bench, "Well, shall we?"

Before us was the arch of a gate carved into a massive marble wall, tall enough to fit ten of me underneath. Its edges were decorated with black iron strands, branching and twisting elegantly into ornate patterns that resembled kelp under the ocean. At the base of the gateway a man and a woman stood guard with polished steel spears and a lightweight armor composed of matte black scales.

"Name and business," the woman requested in an uninterested tone. Her Shakii accent was thick with bravado.

With cold hands I reached into my shoulder bag for Thimlu's badge, but before I could stammer a plea to them Fajro spoke with a voice that carried far more authority than a piece of brass ever could.

"I am Fajro, retired fidelant of Holrag. I have been summoned to deliver a message to the Heiko fidelant that is vital to their deliberations today."

The guard was unmoved. "No one is permitted into the Senate while deliberations are under way. It is an offense toâ€“"

"Yes, I understand. I am delivering this message to her assistant."

"Pomri? She hasn't mentioned this to us."

"I was summoned by the speaker this morning, as the matter is unexpected and urgent."

She deliberated with her partner, and glanced at me once, sending a shock of worry through my bones. I was getting cold again.

"You are permitted to go, but your attendant cannot come with you."

_NO_

He replied, "My attendant helps me walk on account of my injured knee. I could barely walk here without hae help, much less make it to Pomri."

The man glanced at his partner and begrudgingly walked over to me. I dared not to protest as he slid the bag off my shoulder in one quick movement and rummaged through it before throwing it back at me and gesturing to the other guard.

"Make it quick," said the woman.

We walked under the gate and my eyes grew wide as we walked into a wide circular clearing of gardens and pools and walkways as broad and as wide as all of the farm plots I tended to in Heiko. All around us were flowers and bushes and trees from different parts of the world that could certainly not live in such a hot and dry place without the help of the mamen carrying water to and fro in their fine vinegrass frocks. I wished to venture through the plants and speak to the mamen, but I thought it best not to draw attention to myself.

As I took in the rest of this place, I was surprised to see that the stone structure that I believed to be a thick wall was more of a circle of rooms, as was unapparent from the outside. The inner-facing wall was full of tall arches, each emblazoned with the crest of one of the seven provinces, and between them were several openings that overlooked the area. Standing prominently at the center was a massive ovoid building standing prominently in the center of the circle and illuminated by the light through the gate we'd come through.

Fajro interrupted my wonderment, unimpressed by the beauty he'd come to dismiss. "Perhaps it's best that we head towards the Heiko office so as not to seem suspicious. We'll want to enter through that side anyway."

"Good," I said. "I need to give the assistant something."

"Don't," he replied with a hasty snap. "Pomri would never let you leave."

I paused, sensing that Fajro knew more than he was letting on. In any other situation I would stop everything and question him until there were no more lies to tell. But this was his world, as I was learning; a world where the truth had a price. And I was nothing more than a beggar.

We followed the pathways toward the archway beneath the crest of Heiko, and turned the corner to face the building at the center. It was more shaded from this side, but still somehow as radiant as the rest of the city. At the doors were two more guards with the same scale armor and spears. But they looked far more attentive and unmovable.

"How can we get through them?" I asked.

"I'll distract them. Meanwhile you go around them and slip through the door."

A pang of anger welled up in me, "What sort of plan is that?"

"Oh-ho-ho," he laughed. "I think you'll find I can be _very_ distracting."

"Anyone can be distracting. But you're a fidelant. Can't you use that somehow to get me in?"

"Alas," he uttered. "The power of law lies in its enforcement. And trust me when I say these guards know the importance of their duty. Not even rascal like me can sway them from the path of justice."

"Noble," I said. "But annoying." I began to relish in Fajro's slow walking speed, imagining how I might slip by them unnoticed. It seemed only barely possible and only for one of my shorter stature. "What shall I do if they notice me?" I asked.

"Keep going," he said. "You'll be imprisoned either way."

"Yes, but I'd rather not be impaled beforehand."

At about ten paces away from the guards one of them approached and called to us in a stern but quiet voice, "The Deliberation Hall is closed. Turn around." But Fajro didn't stop walking, and I continued to walk by his side while my eyes avoided anything they could. I looked at Fajro and saw his unwavering gaze locked onto theirs, throwing fists with his eyes. _What was he going to do?_ The guard was right in front of us now, speaking to our faces in a low but angry voice. "Turn around and go back where you came from!" he said.

Fajro responded to him confidently, "Tinpo... it's been a while, hasn't it."

"I'm not telling you again. Turn back!"

Fajro's gaze held just enough to rattle the boy, then cracked a perfect smile. "What sort of welcome is this? You don't recognize your uncle anymore?"

"...Uncle..."

Fajro looked him up and down. "Tinpo, you make a fine guard. Your mother would be proud."

"Thank you. Uncle," said Tinpu. He lowered his eyes.

"How long have you been posted here? I haven't heard from your parents since uh..." his voice trailed off to a painful memory that was hidden in their shared knowledge.

<!-- left off -->

"They posted me near the railyards immediately after you referred me, but I've been working my way up here ever since."

"Congratulations, my boy. Reaching this post in such a short time is quite an achievement."

"Thank you, sir."

"And who's your friend over here?" he asked.

"Oh, that's Padji. Thi was posted here around the same time I was."

"You must be good friends. I want to meet hae."

"Oh.. uh sure."

We walked over to where Tinpo had been standing, and just before we got there, Fajro nudged me aside. At first I thought it was an accident because he made it seem that way, but then he stood opposite me and started talking to both of them, shifting their gaze away from the door, and away from me. I saw my moment and quickly tiptoed to the doorway. I lifted the heavy door a bit as I cracked it open: a trick my mother had taught me to stay quiet while we shared a room for sleeping. I slipped inside, and quietly closed it the same way, and then turned to face the most powerful governing body in the world.
