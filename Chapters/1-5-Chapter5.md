## Chapter 5

The city was carved from the body of a tall mountain, with massive veins of white marble meandering between the gray, banded rock. Every road and every building, once hidden beneath the ground, now faced proudly toward the orange and red and infrared of Ara's light. High upon the mountain's crest were the senate grounds, carved from the largest vein of marble and crowned in glimmering brass. I imagined being one of the settlers here, washing and cleaving a small piece of rock to make a home. I didn't know much about Shaki then, but I did know that I preferred the soft luxury of grass and kelp to the hard vanity of marble.

"Been a while for you?" Fajro asked me once we'd gotten off the train.

"Yes," I said, in awe at the mess of people scurrying about in the station square. "I haven't been since Melna first became a fidelant."

He was looking up toward the senate, unmoved by the cacophony of people. "The beauty of Shaki never changes", he said. "In Holrag, we call this place "The diamond of Palinan."

"Even after years of coming here, it hasn't lost its luster?"

"This city changes you the minute your feet hit the marble. Every day here is another lifetime, another chance at winning."

"Winning?" I asked.

"Everyone has their own personal game that makes their life worth living. Like you keeping your bunds together."

"That's my life. It's not a game," I said.

"What's the difference?"

I walked with Fajro from the train station as he guided us to the closest funicular. All around us, the rocky floor was covered in sand from the desert that lay just outside. Ara was fully above the horizon, and brighter than I'd ever seen it. We would have been sweating from the heat but for the shadows cast by a field of monolithic curved mirrors in the distance. As it was told to me, a pipe stands before each one to make steam for the entire city.

An air of bustle filled the area with hordes of ferriers carrying cargo in and out the trains, trade scribes in toe trying to keep up. Their heads would occasionally turn toward a tall tower some distance in the desert, visible to all the city, where a great spot of light was cast upon the wall. _The timekeeper. I remember now._ But after all my cloud-headed observations, I began to notice that our sluggish pace was wearing thin on everyone trying to get around us.

"I'm slowing you down," said Fajro. "Why don't you go on ahead and I'll catch up with you." There was a puzzling tone in his voice; almost as if he'd become a different person when he stepped off the train.

"Our pace is perfectly fine," I told him. "Besides, we're a team now. Going ahead will get me nowhere."

He paused to look around. "You know, I used to keep pace with the ferriers before I busted my knee."

"I imagine your running to and fro is what busted your knee in the first place," I said.

He laughed and said, "The fidelacy is a life dedicated to the pursuit of exhaustion, but none of us would ever dare to show it."

We rode a sort of cable-powered lift up the mountain and toward the senate, making several stops along the way. At each one, I marveled at the beauty of the city from a different angle, and at the people who funneled in and out: the public workers with their dusty canvas tunics, the scribes with their ink-blotted fingers, and the occasional artist lost in thought. Some were carrying their afternoon meal with them as if they had no time to eat, and it made me terribly hungry. But there was no time to eat. I had to prepare for what was to come.

"Senate / Public Square. Last stop," called the operator.

I helped Fajro out of the vehicle and led him to a stone bench a few steps away to rest his legs. All around the square were pots of dark gray stone filled with clay and desert plants from the east, likely the only things that could grow with in so much light.

"Ah this brings me back," said Fajro. "You see that gate? I used to walk through it every day. I would round the left corner as I entered from the west. And the fountain - Oh I loved to perch on the side of that thing and rake my fingers through the cool mist."

"Sounds like you were very fond of this place."

"You could say that. Almost all of my waking life was spent here. It really made an impression on me."

"Do you ever miss it?"

"Some parts. I felt proud of myself, and all that we accomplished despite our differences. You know, I played a big part in the railway pact."

"You?"

"I brokered a treaty for the tribes of Holragi to work together in building a rail for all the world. It helped us become the manufacturing giant we are today, and led us to create the great railway to the sky. The Ara Line."

"You must be proud," I said, not knowing what else to say.

"It would be a sin not to be proud. Alas, the scientists who headed the program won't allow me that privilege. They wanted to expand the observer program; to send observers into space to see what can't be seen from the surface. By the end of my tenure, we still could only send lightweight things into orbit. Even the smallest craft they wanted to send would be too heavy."

"Nothing in life goes according to plan," I said, feeling reminiscent of my days as an observer. "There's always something out of your control that can ruin it all."

He smirked and said, "There are some who search their whole lives for some defense against fate. But once in a generation, a man comes along whose hands fit comfortably upon the lever of kismet, and in doing so becomes an unstoppable force."

I glanced at him as he looked vacantly into the square and felt a strange sense of discomfort at being near him. It seemed there was more to his arrogance than just his ego, but what that was I couldn't be sure. At any rate, my thoughts were focused on calming myself down and observing the area around me, leaving no energy to spend psychoanalyzing a stranger.

After a moment wrapping up his thoughts, he put his hands on the bench, "Well, shall we?"

Before us was the arch of a gate carved into a massive marble wall, tall enough to fit ten of me underneath. Its edges were decorated with black iron strands, branching and twisting elegantly into ornate patterns that resembled kelp under the ocean. At the base of the gateway a man and a woman stood guard with polished steel spears and a lightweight armor composed of matte black scales.

"Name and business," the woman requested in an uninterested tone. Her Shakii accent was thick with bravado.

With cold hands I reached into my shoulder bag for Thimlu's badge, but before I could stammer a plea to them Fajro spoke with a voice that carried far more authority than a piece of brass ever could.

"I am Fajro, retired fidelant of Holrag. I have been summoned to deliver a message to the Heiko fidelant that is vital to their deliberations today."

The guard was unmoved. "No one is permitted into the senate while deliberations are under way. It is an offense to–"

"Yes, I understand. I am delivering this message to her assistant."

"Pomri? She hasn't mentioned this to us."

"I was summoned by her this morning, as the matter is unexpected and urgent."

She whispered a conversatino with her partner, and glanced at me once, sending a shock of worry through my bones. I was getting cold again.

"You are permitted to go, but your attendant cannot come with you."

I panicked and was prepared to rattle off a list of complaints, but Fajro had already prepared a response far more effective than mine would have been. "My attendant helps me walk on account of my injured knee. I could barely walk here without hae help, much less make it to Pomri."

The man glanced at his partner and begrudgingly walked over to me. I dared not to protest as he slid the bag off my shoulder in one quick movement and rummaged through it before throwing it back at me and gesturing to the other guard.

"Make it quick," said the woman.

We walked under the gate and my eyes grew wide as we walked into a wide circular clearing of gardens and pools and walkways far wider than a Heikoi plot of land. All around us were flowers and bushes and trees from different parts of the world that could certainly not live in such a hot and dry place without the help of the mamen carrying water to and fro, dressed in fine frocks made of soft famba and strange heabands covering their ears. I wished to venture through the plants and speak to them, but I thought it best not to draw attention to myself.

As I took in the rest of this place, I was surprised to see that the stone structure all around us that I believed to be a wall was more of a circle of rooms, as was unapparent from the outside. The inner-facing wall was full of tall arches, each emblazoned with the crest of one of the seven provinces, and between them were several openings that overlooked the area, filled with people reading or talking or staring out onto the garden. Standing prominently at the center was a massive ovoid building illuminated by the light of nearly a hundred mirrors at the far side of this place. Upon its white marble walls was an insignia: the seven-tailed halier of the senate with wings flung wide above its head and its talons clutching a scroll.

My wonderment was interrupted by an unimpressed Fajro. "Perhaps it's best that we head towards the Heiko division so as not to seem suspicious. We'll want to enter through that side anyway."

"Good," I said. "I need to give the assistant something."

"Don't," he replied with a hasty snap. "Pomri would never let you leave."

I paused, sensing that Fajro knew more than he was letting on. In any other situation I would stop everything and question him until there were no more lies to tell. But this was his world, as I was learning; a world where the truth had a price. And I was nothing more than a beggar.

We followed the pathways toward the arch beneath the crest of Heiko, and turned the corner to face the building at the center. A door of brass was set into the base of the building – far more modestly sized than the great arched gateways we'd come throough – but two guards stood watch nonetheless, armed with the same scale armor and spears as the ones outside and far more attentive to the world around them.

"How can we get through?" I asked.

"I'll distract them. Meanwhile you go around them and slip through the door."

A pang of anger welled up in me, "What sort of plan is that?"

"Oh-ho-ho," he laughed. "I think you'll find I can be _very_ distracting."

"Anyone can be distracting. But you're a fidelant. Can't you use that somehow to get me in?"

"Alas," he uttered. "The power of law lies in its enforcement. And trust me when I say these guards know the importance of their duty. Not even rascal like me can sway them from the path of justice."

"Noble," I said. "But annoying." I began to relish in Fajro's slow walking speed, imagining how I might slip by them unnoticed. It seemed only barely possible despite my quiet feet and smaller figure. "What should I do if they notice me?" I asked.

"Keep going," he said. "You'll be imprisoned either way."

"Yes, but I'd rather not be impaled beforehand."

At about ten paces away from the guards one of them approached and called to us in a stern but quiet voice, "The Deliberation Hall is closed. Turn around." But Fajro didn't stop walking, and I continued to walk by his side while my eyes avoided anything they could. I looked at Fajro and saw his unwavering gaze locked onto theirs, throwing fists with his eyes. _What was he going to do?_ The guard was right in front of us now, speaking to our faces in a low but angry voice. "Turn around and go back where you came from!" he said.

Fajro responded to him confidently, "Tinpo... it's been a while, hasn't it."

"I'm not telling you again. Turn back!"

Fajro's gaze held just enough to rattle the boy, then cracked a perfect smile. "What sort of welcome is this? You don't recognize your uncle anymore?"

"...Uncle..."

Fajro looked him up and down. "Tinpo, you make a fine guard. Your mother would be proud."

"Thank you. Uncle," said Tinpo. He lowered his eyes.

"How long have you been posted here? I haven't heard from you in nearly a hundred days."

Tinpo looked visibly afraid of the man, but I didn't have time to analyze their relationship. I looked for an opening as they continued talking.

Tinpo spoke in a subdued tone, "They posted me here immediately after you referred me, sir."

"Congratulations, my boy," said Fajro, placing his hands on Tinpo's armored shoulder. "Reaching this post is quite an achievement."

"Yes, sir," he responded. "Thank you, sir."

"And who's your friend over here?"

"Her name is Pashda, sir."

"You must be good friends. Call her over. There's no one else around."

Tinpo glanced at me while I kept my head down, and then waved his partner over. But just before she entered our presence Fajro nudged me aside with a hard shove. "Find something to do, kaln," he growled.

I wanted to punch him square in the stomach, but then I saw that they were paying no attention to me, and it quickly became clear that it was all an intentional act. He stood in a way that shifted their gaze away from the door, and raised his voice to really solidify their focus, leaving my path to the door wide open. Just as I reached the door, a loud yell rang out behind me and I saw the woman named Pashda being thrown to the ground. This was my moment. I lifted the heavy door a bit as I cracked it open – a trick my mother had taught me to stay quiet while we shared a room for sleeping – and I slipped inside, quietly closing it the same way.

I can't say what my sentiment was in that moment, how unimaginably small it must have felt to stand in the corner of a circular room. For my heart was wholly in it, my thoughts were focused on what I'd come to do. The world would hear what I came to tell them.
