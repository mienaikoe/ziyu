  After Kip left for work, I descended down to the cellar to dress for the long day of tuber sowing. The smell of damp on the stone walls pervaded the air and opened my nostrils in reminiscence. My mother was with me. I switched on the overhead power rails, attached a bulb, and opened my wardrobe. Canvas trousers, a thickly-woven shirt, and gloves stained with clay and chlorophyll. As I changed out of my morning clothes, I remembered mornings with my mother, changing into our work clothes.
  She used to grow Pohua, a root vegetable known for its sweet fruity taste. She would carry me in a big thatch bag on her back while she tilled, planted, harvested. I would watch her hands unfold those tiny tubers across the clay and pack them in. At days end, I would gaze in awe of how much she could plant and harvest and aspire to do the same. It's been 6 seasons since she passed, but she lives as vividly in my memories as she did in life.
  "I bet you'll plant 1000 today, Liffa"
  "2000!"
  "Hohoho. 600 then."
  My childhood attention span would always get the best of me before I could get close. I undid the lights and power rail and took a last breath of the earthen basement air. The day was calling.

  "Another day, then," called Tig. She had caught me unawares from her plot of land next to mine. The same farmer's trousers adorned her, but she was apparently more strict about washing them daily.
  "Is your life really that mundane?" I asked jokingly.
  "Oh, I enjoy the repetition. Can't get a body like this by talking all day," she jabbed, both at Mel and her own deteriorating body. I changed the subject.
  "It's chilly today, isn't it?"
  "I suppose so. Every season will have a few of these."
  "Yes, but it’s too early, isn’t it?”
  "Oh you'll get them at all times of the season. Once when I was young we had 4 days of frost right after germination. Lost the whole plot and had to start over."
  "That sounds unfortunate, but I think this one is different. It's the middle of the warm season"
  "It's just a cold spell. These things happen. It'll be back to normal soon, you'll see."
  "Sure. We'll see."
  Her answer was unsatisfying, but I went back to working. Perhaps I was overreacting.
  "So when are you three going to have children? It's been several seasons since you married"
  "That's none of your business"
  "I'm just looking out for you. When you can't dig anymore, you'll wish you had a replacement."
  "I'll be just fine"
  "Though, I wonder how you'll raise kids and crops at the same time. Takes a different sort of mother."
  "Like I said, I'll be fine." The things she said were nothing new, though they always bothered me more than they ought to have.
  We worked side-by-side in silence for a few clicks of the clock, and then she began again in her aggravating way.
  "How are Mel and Kip doing? Any new gossip for an old lady?"
  "They are fine."
  "That's all? Just fine?"
  I snapped, "What do want, woman?"
  "Mind yourself, Lif. What sort of Ofan raises hae voice to an elder?"
  "They're doing just fine, okay? Kip is having a great start at the clinic, and Mel is representing this village to the council. Is that what you're looking for?"
  She went quiet and resumed her work while I stared at her, livid.  
  "A jealous Ofan never rests."
  I jabbed my shovel in the clay and stopped myself from yelling something I would regret later. *That's enough for now*.


-------


  A feeling of humility or perhaps unimportance surfaced as I entered a house that I would never have thought to call home without Mel and Kip. I don't blame Tig for her disdain. She was born of the same caste my parents came from; taught to accept their roles in life as farmers or parents. If they tried to better themselves and get out of that life, they were met with endless criticism from their family for burdening everyone with their risk. I like to imagine that Tig tried to branch out once, but would never admit it to an Ofan who married up and has no interest in raising children.
  I took my boots and trousers off so as not to make a mess, and took a seat at the table. With a sigh, I took in everything around me as if this were all some opulent dream that I would one day wake from and find myself in the slums of some forgotten town. ***I feel guilty. Why do I feel guilty? What sort of corruption has this old bat woven into my heart?***. It felt dirty, like I needed to burn away some part of who I had become. Or reclaim the self-dependent farming Kaln I used to be. I drifted back to childhood, hearing my Father tell us "Nothing is promised - you can only rely on yourself“. But then my Naether reminded him, "You promised to love us". Perhaps they were both right.
  *A Knock at the door*. ***Is it that Tig again come to tell me I was rude?*** I sat up and quietly snuck toward the door to see who it was. ***The messenger? What could he possibly want?*** 
	He started as soon as the door opened, “Lif, I have an urgent message for Mel. Is she here?”
	“Um. No she left a few clicks ago.”
	He was still catching his breath, “You - You need to find a way to get this to her before the vote today.”
	“Okay, slow down. What’s this about?”
	“

 options:
 - Mel comes home to fess up (Mel is weak)
 - Kip comes home to fess up that Mel asked him to do the rescue mission (behind Lif’s back)
 - Lif finds a memo about a project (Mel is not careful)
 - Mel gets an urgent memo sent at home, and Lif needs to follow her to the capital to deliver it. Lif gets curious and opens it - it’s a memo about the mission gone dark. (Mel is strong, Lif is curious). 
 - Lif goes to Kip to discuss it (Lif is weak, but Kip is close-by after all. Does Lif want to keep Kip out of it?)
 - Lif goes to Mel to ask more or investigate (What does Lif expect to gain from this?)
 - Lif waits until the evening (Lif is strong, takes time to gather thoughts. Wants to keep Kip out of it)


  In chapter 2, we unravel Lif's life and a little bit of her personal
  complexes and suspicions through dialog with others where she seems suspicious
  of the cold but everyone older thinks she's overreacting or still

  Mel and Kip have gone to their respective workplaces.

  Main point of action is that Lif discovers ambiguous information about the first mission and decides how to act
