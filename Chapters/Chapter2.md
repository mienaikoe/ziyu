After Kip left for work, I descended down to the cellar to dress for the long day of harvest preparation. The smell of damp on the stone walls pervaded the air and opened my nostrils in reminiscence. My mother was with me. I switched on the overhead power rails, attached a bulb, and opened my wardrobe. Trousers, a rough shirt, and gloves stained with clay and chlorophyll. As I changed out of my morning clothes, I remembered changing in the mornings with my mother.
She used to grow Pohua, a root vegetable that she specialized in growing. She would carry me in a big thatch bag on her back while she tilled, planted, harvested. I would watch her hands unfold those tiny tubers across the clay and pack them in. At days end, I would gaze in awe of how much she could plant and harvest and aspire to do the same. It's been 36 seasons since she passed, but she lives as vividly in my memories as she did in life.
  "I bet you'll plant 1000 today, Liffa"
  "2000!"
  "Hohoho. 600 then."
I never made it to 2000. My childhood attention span would always run out after the first 500 or so and give up. Over the seasons, and especially once I had my own crop to attend, I got quicker with my planting and harvesting. Enough to match my mother. We supplied enough Pohua to provide for the village and some outside villages too, and became pretty well known for it. Once she couldn't work anymore, I tried to take on her portion of the job, but I just couldn't keep up, and our popularity faded. Now Pohua has become an occasional food instead of a staple.
I undid the lights and power rail and took a breath of the earthen walls: I was ready to shoot for 2000 again.
