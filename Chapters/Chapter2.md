After Kip left for work, I descended down to the cellar to dress for the long day of harvest preparation. The earthen smell on the stone walls pervaded the air and turned my nose upward to take it all in. I switched on the overhead power rails, attached a bulb, and opened my wardrobe. Trousers, a rough shirt, and gloves stained with the earth: these were my uniform, my pride, but not my passion. I was one of a few that volunteered my time and my family's land during the humid season to put food on the tables of my home village. If given the chance to do it again I would not, but while I had this role I was planning to do a damn good job of it.
