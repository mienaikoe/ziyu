After Kip left for work, I descended down to the cellar to dress for the long day of harvest preparation. The smell of damp on the stone walls pervaded the air and opened my nostrils in reminiscence. My mother was with me. I switched on the overhead power rails, attached a bulb, and opened my wardrobe. Canvas trousers, a thickly-woven shirt, and gloves stained with clay and chlorophyll. As I changed out of my morning clothes, I remembered mornings with my mother, changing into our work clothes.
She used to grow Pohua, a root vegetable known for its sweet fruity taste. She would carry me in a big thatch bag on her back while she tilled, planted, harvested. I would watch her hands unfold those tiny tubers across the clay and pack them in. At days end, I would gaze in awe of how much she could plant and harvest and aspire to do the same. It's been 6 seasons since she passed, but she lives as vividly in my memories as she did in life.
  "I bet you'll plant 1000 today, Liffa"
  "2000!"
  "Hohoho. 600 then."
My childhood attention span would always get the best of me before I could get close.
I undid the lights and power rail and took a last breath of the earthen basement air. The day was calling.

  "Another day, then," called Tig. She had caught me while working the area of my plot next to hers. Farmer's trousers adorned her, but she was apparently more strict about washing them daily.
  "So life is one big chore to you?"
  "Oh, I enjoy the repetition. Can't get a body like this by talking all day in the city," she joked, both at Mel and her own deteriorating body.
  "When are you three going to have children? It's been several seasons since you married"
  "That's none of your business"
  "I'm just looking out for you. When you can't farm any longer, you'll wish you had made your replacement."
  "I'll be just fine, Tig."
  "Though, I wonder how you'll nurse and farm at the same time. Takes a different sort of mother."
  "Like I said, I'll be fine." The things she said were nothing new, though they always bothered me more than they ought to have.
  We worked side-by-side in silence for a few clicks of the clock, and then she began again in her aggravating way.
  "So how are Mel and Kip?"
  "They are fine."
  "That's all? Just fine?"
  I snapped, "What do want, woman?!"
  "Mind yourself, Lif. What sort of Ofan raises Ã¾u voice to an elder?"
  "They're doing great, okay? Kip has a great start at being a doctor, and Mel is representing this village to the council. Is that what you want to hear?"
  She kept working and went quiet while I sulked at my work in regret.
  "A jealous Ofan never rests."
  I stuck my shovel in the clay and walked back to the house. I had enough for now.

  In chapter 2, we unravel Lif's life and a little bit of her personal
  complexes and suspicions through dialog with others where she seems suspicious
  of the cold but everyone older thinks she's overreacting or still

  Mel and Kip have gone to their respective workplaces.

Over the seasons, and especially once I had my own crop to attend, I got quicker with my planting and harvesting. Enough to match my mother. We supplied enough Pohua to provide for the village and some outside villages too, and became pretty well known for it. Once she couldn't work anymore, I tried to take on her portion of the job, but I just couldn't keep up, and our popularity faded. Now Pohua has become an occasional food instead of a staple.
