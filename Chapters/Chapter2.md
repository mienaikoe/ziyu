  After Kip left for work, I descended down to the cellar to dress for the long day of tuber sowing. The smell of damp on the stone walls pervaded the air and opened my nostrils in reminiscence. My mother was with me. I switched on the overhead power rails, attached a bulb, and opened my wardrobe. Canvas trousers, a thickly-woven shirt, and gloves stained with clay and chlorophyll. As I changed out of my morning clothes, I remembered mornings with my mother, changing into our work clothes.
  She used to grow Pohua, a root vegetable known for its sweet fruity taste. She would carry me in a big thatch bag on her back while she tilled, planted, harvested. I would watch her hands unfold those tiny tubers across the clay and pack them in. At days end, I would gaze in awe of how much she could plant and harvest and aspire to do the same. It's been 6 seasons since she passed, but she lives as vividly in my memories as she did in life.
  "I bet you'll plant 1000 today, Liffa"
  "2000!"
  "Hohoho. 600 then."
  My childhood attention span would always get the best of me before I could get close. I undid the lights and power rail and took a last breath of the earthen basement air. The day was calling.

  "Another day, then," called Tig. She had caught me while working the area of my plot next to hers. The same farmer's trousers adorned her, but she was apparently more strict about washing them daily.
  "Is your life really that mundane?" I asked jokingly.
  "Oh, I enjoy the repetition. Can't get a body like this by talking all day in the city," she jabbed, both at Mel and her own deteriorating body. I changed the subject.
  "It's chilly today, isn't it?"
  "I suppose so. Every season will have a few of these."
  "Yes, but not at this time of the season."
  "Oh you'll get them at all times of the season. This one season we had 4 days of frost right after we sowed. Lost the whole plot and had to start over."
  "That sounds unfortunate, but I think this one is different. It's the middle of the warm season"
  "It's just a cold spell. These things happen. It'll be back to normal soon, you'll see."
  "Sure. We'll see."
  Her answer was unsatisfying, but I went back to working. Perhaps I was overreacting.
  "So when are you three going to have children? It's been several seasons since you married"
  "That's none of your business"
  "I'm just looking out for you. When you can't dig anymore, you'll wish you had a replacement."
  "I'll be just fine"
  "Though, I wonder how you'll raise kids and crops at the same time. Takes a different sort of mother."
  "Like I said, I'll be fine." The things she said were nothing new, though they always bothered me more than they ought to have.
  We worked side-by-side in silence for a few clicks of the clock, and then she began again in her aggravating way.
  "How are Mel and Kip doing? Any new gossip for an old lady?"
  "They are fine."
  "That's all? Just fine?"
  I snapped, "What do want, woman?"
  "Mind yourself, Lif. What sort of Ofan raises hae voice to an elder?"
  "They're doing just fine, okay? Kip is having a great start at the clinic, and Mel is representing this village to the council. Is that what you're looking for?"
  She went quiet and resumed her work while I stared at her, livid.  
  "A jealous Ofan never rests."
  I jabbed my shovel in the clay and stopped myself from yelling something I would regret later. *That's enough for now*.

  My sense of humility or perhaps a feeling of unimportance surfaced as I entered a house that I could never have called home on my own. I don't blame Tig for her perspective. She was born of the same caste my parents came from; taught to accept their roles in life as farmers or parents. If they tried to better themselves and get out of farming, they would be met with endless criticism from their family for burdening everyone with their risk. I like to imagine that Tig tried to branch out once, but would never admit it to a lowly farming Ofan who married up and has no interest in raising children.
  I took my boots and trousers off so as not to make a mess, and took a seat at the table. With a sigh, I took in everything around me as if this were all some dream that I would one day abruptly wake from. My father used to say that "Nothing is promised". And my nather would always respond, "You promised to love us".
  Something felt out of place. *A cup. That's odd. I don't remember getting a cup out*. An uneasy feeling suddenly gripped me and amplified the silence. I left the cup just in case I would need to retrace the scene, and quietly inched my way toward the cellar to get something to defend myself with. *Crap. What if the killer is down there. Killer? You're being paranoid*. After a moment of indecisiveness, I grabbed a long glass bottle from the shelf and proceeded to slowly creep along the wall toward the back of the house.

  In chapter 2, we unravel Lif's life and a little bit of her personal
  complexes and suspicions through dialog with others where she seems suspicious

  Mel and Kip have gone to their respective workplaces.

Over the seasons, and especially once I had my own crop to attend, I got quicker with my planting and harvesting. Enough to match my mother. We supplied enough Pohua to provide for the village and some outside villages too, and became pretty well known for it. Once she couldn't work anymore, I tried to take on her portion of the job, but I just couldn't keep up, and our popularity faded. Now Pohua has become an occasional food instead of a staple.
