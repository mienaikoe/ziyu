After Kip left for work, I descended down to the cellar to dress for the long day of harvest preparation. The smell of damp on the stone walls pervaded the air and opened my nostrils in reminiscence. My mother was with me. I switched on the overhead power rails, attached a bulb, and opened my wardrobe. Trousers, a rough shirt, and gloves stained with clay and chlorophyll.
My mother used to grow Pohua, a root vegetable that she specialized in growing. She would carry me in a big thatch bag on her back while she tilled, planted, harvested. I would watch her hands unfold the tiny tubers into the clay and pack them into the ground. At days end, I would gaze in awe of how much she could do. I still don't think I have her endurance, but I keep trying each year.
