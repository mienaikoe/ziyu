  You cannot hear the first note of a jiyu's song. There is no grand entrance or catchy hook. No meandering conversation between a point and its counter. Each leaf is but the gentlest voice in a choir of wind. In a calm wind, or when it's too chilly the song is inaudible. But as the wind slowly picks up and the sun grows in the warm season, you start to recognize the sound, only it's been there for a quite a while and you can't quite place when exactly it began. At full breeze you are deafened by the sound of every leaf and the complexity of the resounding chords and flourishes.
  It was under this tree that I was born. Among its leaves and stems and branches, I made my first cry to the world and the world sang back to me. My mother used to tell me it was the most beautiful way to hold me in her arms for the first time. I still imagine it sometimes when I come here: laying in her arms after a nap, hidden within the greatest sound in all the world. She would usually sleep longer than me, and I would stare at her hair bobbing in the wind against the pale orange of our the sun.
  The traditions say it is good luck to be born under that tree, but to be born under its song is a blessing unmatched by any other. I've never felt particularly blessed, born a regular maman of an agricultural family. No real talents other than tilling soil or harvesting root vegetables. I once caught the milta that had eaten almost half of our parsnips. We kept her and I named her Atlim, a name so creative that no one else had even thought of it. Perhaps the universe thought that its luck was ill-spent on a dolt like me and revoked my luck license (If you're listening, universe, I've resolved to impress you through my smooth talking and silly walking. I am confident that I will win back your favor).
  Perhaps, though, I had never put my luck to the test. I tried falling in love once, and I got married so I wouldn't have to make that mistake again. I could go to the cities to improve myself, but I hate it there.
