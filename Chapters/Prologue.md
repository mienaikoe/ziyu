You cannot hear the first note of a jiyu's song. There is no grand entrance or catchy hook. No meandering conversation between a point and its counter. Each leaf is but the gentlest voice in a choir of wind. In a calm wind, or when it's too chilly the song is inaudible. But as the wind slowly picks up and the sun grows and warms the day, you start to recognize the sound, only it's been there for a quite a while and you can't quite place when exactly it began. At full breeze you are deafened by the sound of every leaf and the complexity of the resounding chords and flourishes.
It was under this tree that I was born. Among its leaves and stems and branches, I made my first cry to the world and the world sang back to me. My mother used to tell me it was most beautiful to hold me in her arms for the first time in this place. I still imagine it sometimes when I come here: laying in her arms after a nap, hidden within the greatest sound in all the world. She would usually sleep longer than me, and I would stare at her hair bobbing in the wind against the pale orange of our the sun.
The traditions say it is good luck to be born under a jiyu, and to be born under its song is a blessing unmatched by any other. I've never felt particularly blessed, born a regular maman in an agricultural town. No real talents other than tilling soil or harvesting root vegetables. I once caught the milta that had eaten almost half of our parsnips, so I guess I'm quick as well, but that's pretty typical for a Palinian maman. Perhaps it is simply that I have never put my luck to the test. I tried falling in love, and I got married so I wouldn't have to do it again. I go to the city sometimes with Mel, but it's usually to help with something at her work. And we are still too young to have children of our own. I leave my adventures to the dealings of my garden, and my library of books.
This morning's adventure was to come back to my birthplace, a birthday tradition of Palinians. Though my parents have passed, I still feel their presence here whenever I come back. They welcome me as the tree does with its great branch-arms stretched wide toward the sun. "I'm back," I tell them, and they let out a sigh of relief that I have made it another year. I take my place next to its trunk and wait for the song to lift me.
  "Something is wrong," my subconscious began.
  I fought back, "It's fine. It's just a little late," and went back to waiting.
  "...It's not coming. Something is wrong."
  The wind had picked up and the sun was warming the land, but the Jiyu remained silent.
  "It's gone. Why is it gone?"
  I stopped my panicked head with a deep breath. "It's just too cold," I said aloud. "The leaves are too cold to sing."
  The air had barely a chill, but the tree remained silent as I tossed and turned trying to come up with an answer that would settle my mind. None came.
  I stood up and dusted off my trousers, catching a last glimpse of the horizon sun through the leaves. This place felt unkind, as if possessed by some spirit of death, unseen and brooding. My family used to have a saying that I took to heart when I tended to the garden: ***Nature speaks loudest when it is quiet***. It seemed like a simple farmer's saying about root rot or bird migration, but I couldn't shake the feeling that it was made about something far more grave to come.
