## Chapter 9


The forest floor was covered with dried thin leaves and branches that had fallen from the canopy. Kip listened closely for signs of life as he tried his best to quiet his crunching underfoot. This was not a place for Throngia. There were no shrubs to forage, no fruiting clusters in sight, no animals scurrying up and down trees or whistling upon the air. It was unsettlingly silent. He cleared a patch of ground looking for anything that might have fallen, but only tree roots and compacted leaves appeared.

"There was a bonfire when we came in. That must be from the other exiles. They must have food somehow," he said to himself. His memory of where the fire was foggy but he set out in the direction of Ulu, where he presumed the center of the island to be.

He came to a small clearing in the trees where he noticed specific markings on a branch. They were thin rings carved around the branches with an ochre red fill. They resembled a sort of flow tattoo design he had tried before where the vasculature in his skin sheared the lines to make erratic curves that were all aligned to each other. He stopped to study them, running his fingers against the carvings. In the silence and intense concentration, he started to hear a faint static ticking noise as if it were coming from inside his head.

"Are you lost?" A voice suddenly called out.

He turned around to find the child following his footsteps.

"You've been following me?"

"Yes. They know you're here."

"Who?"

"The other exiles. They know the schedule. They wait for you to starve and then come to collect you when you're weak."

"How do you know all this?"

"I've been here three times."

Kip was aghast imagining what this child's life might be like.

"Where are your parents?"

"My nather lives under the light. My mother lives here."

"Lives here? What do you mean?"

"Hae sentence was for 10 ma'to. Thi got through half of it and decided thi didn't want to go back."

"And your father?"

Thi hesitated. "He's the reason my mother is here."

He understood.

Crouching down to hae level, he asked, "What is your name, kaln?"

Thi hesitated again but quickly turned hae attention to something worrisome behind Kip. He turned around quickly with his torch held high and caught the nose of a woman, with a spear on her back as tall as she was. She grunted with fury at the fire, and yanked the torch from Kip's grasp with ease. Kip began to run, but between the child and the darkness, he couldn't find his way and tripped on a root after only a few steps. The woman walked to them slowly, and picked up the child.

"Wan. We haven't seen you here in ages. Run off now to your mother," she said with a peculiar accent.

Wan obeyed, leaving Kip behind.

"As for you, you're a vigorous one. We have a great job for people like you."

Kip tried to stand up, but the woman drew her spear at him and said, "Running is futile. Trust me, nobody here wants you dead."

She picked up the torch and held it closer to his face, "They like their prey alive."
