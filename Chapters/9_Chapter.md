## Chapter 9


The forest floor was covered with dried thin leaves and branches that had fallen from the canopy. Kip listened closely for signs of life as he tried his best to quiet his crunching underfoot. This was not a place for Throngia. There were no shrubs to forage, no fruiting clusters in sight, no animals scurrying up and down trees or whistling upon the air. It was unsettlingly silent. He cleared a patch of ground looking for anything that might have fallen, but only tree roots and compacted leaves appeared.

"There was a bonfire when we came in. That must be from the other exiles. They must have food somehow," he said to himself. His memory of where the fire was foggy but he set out in the direction of Ulu, where he presumed the center of the island to be.

He came to a small clearing in the trees where he noticed specific markings on them. They were composed of thin rings carved around the branches with an ochre red fill. He saw a resemblance to a sort of flow tattoo design he had tried before where the vasculature in his skin sheared the lines to make erratic curves that were all aligned to each other. He stopped to study them, and felt suddenly sleepy when he realized it had happened much to quickly to have been natural. Before he could run from the clearing, he fell to the ground and blacked out.
