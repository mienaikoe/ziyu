## Chapter 9


Set led Kip from behind, with the darkness playing the role of both binding and blindfold. Kip searched through the darkness to spot more of the patterns on tree branches as they approached the fire. The branches and patterns seemed to become much bigger as they went on. *Copper is so rare. What are they doing wrapping it around trees?* As they approached the fire, he could hear the familiar sounds of civilizatiom: wood chopping, steam pipes, but oddly very little conversation. As he got closer he realized almost everyone here was in kanosin withdraw just like his own group. He balked at the thought of what the social hierarchy here might look like. Clearly his new friend wasn't a working class junkie like the rest of them.

The fire was a behemoth of heat eating through 10 logs at once. It would have escaped and eaten the entire village had it not been dug into the ground and surrounded by thick firebrick. The forge and machinist were cleverly situated mere steps away, with its own fire stoked by the much larger one. There were people cooking fish and kelp on the other side simply by putting them directly on the brick and flipping them over occasionally. The smell was intoxicating to Kip and he briefly considered stealing a morsel. Either through experience or observation, Set instinctively said, "Don't even think about it."

At the far side of the fire a tent stood tall and proud, painted with the same luminous ink that was in the woman's skin. Kip could hear the noises of a nearly a thousand people inside of it. Set took his shoulder and said, "In here, you stay with me."

She flipped the tent cover and they entered a new world of blue light. Everyone had luminescence covering their bodies and wore nothing but this luminescence. Some were singing and clapping songs from the mainland, some were dancing to them, and others were in the throws of erotic ecstasy. All were unbothered by the entrance of Set and her capture.

She led him through narrow spaces between people. Some made room and others did not even notice them. As they progressed deeper into the tent, the odor of sweat and bodies became heavier and heavier.

He asked Set, yelling through the noise, "How can you stand this stench?"

"You get used to it," She replied.

They came to the back of the tent, where a maman no more than Kip's age sat on a rug in front of a tent post, smoking something sweet through a long pipe and laughing with others around hae.

Set whispered something in hae ear, and the maman looked Kip up and down with a mischievous smile. Thi motioned to him to join hae on the other side of the tent wall. Set pushed him to go, and he hesitantly went. To his surprise, the other side wasn't the outside, but another smaller tent with just the maman and him. He knew where this was going.

The maman spoke to him with a charming face.

"I'm Lissa. I own this island and all the people on it, including you. If you cooperate with us, all of your fantasies can be fulfilled," thi said with her voice and thoughts trailing off into some other time and place.

"If you choose not to... we have a way to steal all of your fun."

Kip stared at hae, not knowing whether to run or say something.

Lissa changed to a serious face. "We kill you," and back again, "Anyway, just cooperate and we'll all have a great time."

Thi observed him with a feigned frown.

"You seem a bit on-edge. Have a bit of this."

Thi held up the pipe to Kip's nose and encouraged him to take a drag. He took the pipe, but immediately tried to give it back.

"See this is what I'm talking about," said Lissa, pulling out a dagger. Thi swiftly moved behind him and held it to his neck before he could move to escape. Realizing he wasn't going anywhere, he slowly took up the pipe onto his lips, trying his best not to inhale.

"Inhale," thi commanded.

He inhaled a small bit and the smoke triggered his cough reflex almost immediately. He tried to cough without moving forward into the dagger. Lissa lowered the dagger and put it away, saying "There you go. You'll get the hang of it. One more."

He caught his breath and took another drag. This time it was longer and smoother, and he felt his muscles relaxing significantly, almost to the point of being immovable.

"There you go," Lissa said. He could feel hae hands traveling across his skin as if thi had grown another pair. The floor became an ocean of pillows with hae hands as the waves and he was sinking into them.

// all he can think of is Lif in his dream state.
// Lis gives up on him \ can't fuck him while he's thinking about someone else.
