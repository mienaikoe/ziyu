## Chapter 9


Setre led Kip from behind, with the darkness playing the role of both binding and blindfold. Kip searched through the darkness to spot more of the patterns on tree branches as they approached the fire. The branches and patterns seemed to become much bigger as they went on. *Copper is so rare. What are they doing wrapping it around trees?* As they approached the fire, he could hear the familiar sounds of civilization: wood chopping, steam pipes, but oddly very little conversation. As he got closer he realized almost everyone here was in kanosin withdraw just like his own group. He balked at the thought of what the social hierarchy here might look like. Clearly his new friend wasn't a working class junkie like the rest of them.

"Who are these people?" He asked.

"Kano-heads. They're lowlifes who come for their sentence, work until they've recovered, and then leave."

"What about the others?"

"You'll see."

The fire was a behemoth of heat eating through 10 logs at once. It would have escaped and eaten the entire village had it not been dug into the ground and surrounded by thick firebrick. The forge and machinist were cleverly situated mere steps away, with its own fire stoked by the much larger one. There were people cooking fish and kelp on the other side simply by putting them directly on the brick and flipping them over occasionally. The smell made Kip lose all his focus and he briefly considered stealing a morsel. Either through experience or observation, Setre instinctively said, "Don't even think about it."

At the far side of the fire a tent stood tall and proud, painted with the same luminous ink that was in the woman's skin. Kip could hear the noises of a nearly a thousand people inside of it. Setre took his shoulder and said, "In here, you stay with me."

She flipped the tent cover and they entered a new world of blue light. Everyone had luminescence covering their bodies and wore nothing but this luminescence. Some were singing and clapping songs from the mainland, some were dancing to them, and others were in the throws of erotic ecstasy. All were unbothered by the entrance of Setre and her capture.

She led him through narrow spaces between people. Some made room and others did not even notice them. As they progressed deeper into the tent, the odor of sweat and bodies became heavier and heavier.

He asked Setre, yelling through the noise, "How can you stand this stench?"

"You get used to it," She replied.

They came to the back of the tent, where a maman no more than Kip's age sat on a rug in front of a tent post, smoking something sweet through a long pipe and laughing with others around hae.

Setre whispered something in hae ear, and the maman looked Kip up and down with a mischievous smile. Thi motioned to him to join them on the other side of the tent wall. Setre pushed him to go, and he hesitantly went. To his surprise, the other side wasn't the outside, but another smaller tent with soft linens across the floor. He knew where this was going.

The maman spoke to him with a charming face.

"I'm Lissa. I own this island and all the people on it, including you. If you cooperate with us, all of your fantasies will be fulfilled," thi said with hae voice and thoughts trailing off into some other time and place.

"If you choose not to... we have a way to steal all of your fun."

Kip stared at hae, not knowing whether to run or say something.

Setre chimed in with glee, "We hunt you down and kill you."

And Lissa continued, "Anyway, just cooperate and we'll all have a great time."

Thi observed him with a feigned frown.

"You seem a bit on-edge. Have a bit of the spirit."

Thi held up the pipe to Kip's nose and encouraged him to take a drag. He took the pipe, but immediately tried to give it back.

"See this is what I'm talking about," said Lissa, pulling out a dagger. Thi swiftly moved behind him and held it to his neck before he could move to escape. Realizing he wasn't going anywhere, he slowly took up the pipe onto his lips, trying his best not to inhale.

"Inhale," thi commanded.

He inhaled a small bit and the smoke triggered his cough reflex almost immediately. He tried to cough without moving his neck into the dagger, and Lissa lowered it and put it away, saying "There you go. You'll get the hang of it. One more."

He caught his breath and took another drag. This time it was longer and smoother, and he felt his muscles relaxing significantly, almost to the point of being immovable.

"There you go," Lissa said while thi and Setre laid him down on the floor. He could feel their hands traveling across his skin and multiplying to eight, twelve hands. He was feeling an internal tension, like a tangled string being pulled too hard.

"Lif, Mel," he called out.

"Shh," Lissa said, "We are all a family in the darkness."

The floor became an ocean of linens and he was sinking into them. *All of your fantasies.* This was something he had imagined ma'to ago, to trim away all his inhibitions and bathe in carnal desires with strangers. Such things were taboo in Heiko as a corruption of consciousness, especially to those who were bound. But then, everything had come to feel like a corruption of consciousness. He reached out to Lissa to touch hae blue luminating skin and pull hae closer.

The rest faded into the intoxicated night, never to be seen on any of their memories.
