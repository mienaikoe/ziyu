## Chapter 9


Setre led Kip from behind, with the darkness playing the role of both binding and blindfold. Kip searched through the darkness to spot more of the patterns on tree branches as they approached the fire. The branches and patterns seemed to become much bigger as they went on. *Copper is so rare. What are they doing wrapping it around trees?* As they approached the fire, he could hear the familiar sounds of civilization: wood chopping, steam pipes, but oddly very little conversation. As he got closer he realized almost everyone here was in kanosin withdraw just like his own group. He balked at the thought of what the social hierarchy here might look like. Clearly his new friend wasn't a working class junkie like the rest of them.

"Who are these people?" He asked.

"Kano-heads. They're lowlifes who come for their sentence, work until they've recovered, and then leave."

"What about the others?"

"You'll see."

The fire was a behemoth of heat eating through 10 logs at once. It would have escaped and eaten the entire village had it not been dug into the ground and surrounded by thick firebrick. The forge and machinist were cleverly situated mere steps away, with its own fire stoked by the much larger one. There were people cooking fish and kelp on the other side simply by putting them directly on the brick and flipping them over occasionally. The smell made Kip lose all his focus and he briefly considered stealing a morsel. Either through experience or observation, Setre instinctively said, "Don't even think about it."

At the far side of the fire a tent stood tall and proud, painted with the same luminous ink that was in the woman's skin. Kip could hear the noises of a nearly a thousand people inside of it.

Setre took his shoulder and said, "In here, you stay close to me."

He nodded. He didn't really have a choice.

Setre glanced into the tent, and then turned her head back to him. "Also, what is your name and your occupation?"

"Kipnu. I'm a doctor... why do you need to know that?"

She looked him up and down again, surprised.

"I need to call you something when I introduce you."

She flipped the tent cover and they entered a new world of blue light. Everyone had luminescence covering their bodies and wore nothing but this luminescence. Some were smoking some drug he hadn't encountered before, some were singing and dancing songs from the mainland, and others were in the throws of erotic ecstasy. All were unbothered by the entrance of Setre and her capture.

She led him through the narrow spaces between people. Some made room and others did not even notice them. As they progressed deeper into the tent, the air became stifling thick with the odor of smoke and sweat.

He asked Setre, yelling through the noise, "How can you stand this stench?"

"You get used to it," She replied.

They came to the back of the tent, where a maman no more than Kip's age sat on a rug in front of a tent post, smoking something sweet through a long pipe and laughing with others around hae.

Setre whispered something in hae ear, and the maman looked Kip up and down with a mischievous smile. Thi motioned to him to join them on the other side of the tent wall. Setre pushed him to go, and he hesitantly went. To his surprise, the other side wasn't the outside, but another smaller tent with soft linens across the floor. He knew where this was going.

The maman spoke to him with a charming face.

"Hello Kipnu. My name is Lissa. I own this island and all the people on it, including you. If you do what is asked of you, all of your fantasies will be fulfilled," thi said with hae voice and thoughts trailing off into some other time and place.

"If you choose not to... we have a way to steal all of your fun."

Kip stared at hae with cold eyes, nothing he wanted to say would be helpful.

Setre chimed in with glee, "We hunt you down and kill you."

And Lissa continued, "Anyway, just cooperate and we'll all have a great time."

Thi observed him with a feigned frown.

"You seem a bit on-edge. Have a bit of the spirit."

Thi held up the pipe to Kip's nose and encouraged him to take a drag. He took the pipe, but immediately tried to give it back.

"See this is what I'm talking about," said Lissa, pulling out a dagger. Thi swiftly moved behind him and held it to his neck before he could move to escape. Realizing he wasn't going anywhere, he slowly took up the pipe onto his lips, trying his best not to inhale.

"Inhale," thi commanded.

He inhaled a small bit and the smoke triggered his cough reflex almost immediately. He tried to cough without moving his neck into the dagger, and Lissa lowered it and put it away, saying "There you go. You'll get the hang of it. One more."

He caught his breath and took another drag. This time it was longer and smoother, and he felt his muscles relaxing significantly, almost to the point of being immovable. His head was rushing with thoughts and feelings; if he stopped to consider any of them, they would slip away in the next moment.

"There you go," Lissa said while thi and Setre laid him down on the floor. He could feel their hands traveling across his skin and multiplying to eight, twelve hands. He was feeling an internal tension, like a tangled string being pulled too hard.

"Lif...Mel," he called out.

"Shh," Lissa said, "We are all a family in the darkness."

The floor became an ocean of linens and he was sinking into them. *All of your fantasies.* This was something he had imagined ma'to ago, to trim away all his inhibitions and bathe in carnal desires with strangers. Such things were taboo in Heiko as a corruption of consciousness, especially to those who were bound. But then, everything had come to feel like a corruption of consciousness. He reached out to Lissa to touch hae blue luminating skin and pull hae closer.

She said, "Never forget... I own you."

The rest faded into the night, hidden forever from the mind where the luckiest of regretful memories live.

*Where am I?*

Kip opened his eyes and found himself floating alone on an ocean of thick black fluid. The dark of Ulu lie above him, and a faint halo of light surrounded the horizon. He tried to lift himself up, but the ocean held fast. *Is this the afterlife? Have I died? This feels too real to be a dream.* Slowly, the fluid turned into hundred hands and began to pull him down. He tried fighting against them, but they held on tighter. He held his breath while sinking into the abyss until he couldn't hold it any longer. *Drowning would be ok. Ending would be ok.* His lungs let go, and he let the dark flow in, permeating his blood, until he couldn't feel anything.

He woke up again, but this time he was suspended above Palinan with the full brightness of Ara behind him. Lif was in a small metal capsule directly in front of him. Thi was screaming trying to tell him something, but he couldn't hear hae.

"Lif!" he called to hae, but thi couldn't hear him either. He tried to move toward hae, but there was nothing to push against. The heat and light from Ara was suddenly blotted out, and he twisted around to see a giant orb of the black liquid approaching them. It swallowed them both, and Kip tried to grab Lif right as it swallowed him, but thi was lost in the darkness. Kip kept swimming through the dark, reaching for the next place Lif could be, but he was getting nowhere. He lost all feeling before he gave up to the dark again.

He woke up a third time, naked and alone in the small tent he remembered from last night. His clothes were nowhere to be found, and he felt a dull headache behind his right eye. He knew that this wasn't a dream: the pain was too real. His eyes glanced downward at his body and saw a single luminescent blue line going down his chest. He winced at its suggestion, and dropped his head back down.

"Shit, What did I do?" he said to himself. The spectre of guilt began to seep into his bones, carrying with it incessant chills and aches. He was still confused, but he remembered Lissa's and Setre's hands. The hands of warmth he so longed for, were now cold as death in the last remaining memories he had. His body lay lifeless as he struggled to muster the mental strength to move any part of his body, even his breathing. He felt detached from his body like he was still floating in a dream, but he couldn't see the dream unfolding. The darkness still held him in its ocean.

"Kip! Get up!" A voice called to him from the other room. It was Setre.

She burst into the room, in full armor and spear, and didn't hesitate to pull Kip up to his feet. He pushed her away and shouted at her, "Get away from me."

She pulled her spear on him, and he swatted it away, "You threaten my life with your spear. But how do you threaten a man who has lost meaning in his life?"

With a flick of the wrist, she sliced through a fatty part of his thigh, making Kip shout out in pain.

"With a spear," she said.

She pulled out a cloth wrapping from her sling bag and threw it at him.

"Bandage yourself up and come back into the grand yurt. Lissa will speak with you."

"I have nothing to talk with hae about."

"You will do as commanded."

She left the room, leaving the still naked Kip bleeding and bandaging himself. He bandaged the wound the way he had done for many of his patients, but it was decidedly more difficult doing it on himself. Once bandaged, he realized that he was still freezing and without clothing. *This must be some initiation or something.* He stood himself up and walked to the curtains, reaffirming himself before he went into the next room.

The room was full of nearly a hundred people. They all had the same blue luminescent markings as yesterday but they were silent now, staring at him like he was something to eat. *Why is everyone here? What are they looking at me for?*

Lissa and hae crew sat where he entered the tent yesterday, forcing him to walk the width of the tent and be shown to everyone in the crowd.

"Kip. Approach," Lissa said from across the tent. Setre was behind him, ensuring he didn't turn back.

He turned his head, but kept walking, "Setre, why all this ceremony for me?"

"You are healthy, strong, and smart. A very rare combination for people sent to Ulu. Keep moving."

As he approached, the people behind him followed behind him to form an oval. Once he had gotten close enough Setre instructed him to kneel, which he did slowly as it caused him pain in his thigh to do so.

Lissa began the ceremony, "Welcome, Kipnu. Yesterday you were a slave to the light. Today, you become a guardian of the dark. Somewhere in this room, your new tribe stands waiting to welcome you into their embrace."

Kip stood shivering and just wanting to get the ceremony overwith.

"But we all must make sacrifices to have the things we desire. Those who want you must be willing to trade something of their own."

Thi paused again. *Is this an auction?*

"Kipnu. Please tell us who you are."

He stammered out his introduction through bouts of shivering, "I-I am K-Kipnu um Heiko. I am a doctor."

The crowd filled with murmurs before he was done talking.

"I am bound to Liffa and Melna," he shouted over the crowd, but no one heard him.

Lissa gestured to them to quiet down and addressed the crowd, "Now you know who Kipnu is. Let the bidding begin!"

"400 Kanosin!"

"5 slaves!"

The crowd bunched in and crowded Lissa who was receiving bids and telling them to hae scribe. Setre had moved away from Kip and was now forming a perimeter around Lissa. The noise was aggravating Kip's headache, so he crouched down and covered his ears to wait it out. He had never felt this humiliated or powerless before. There was nowhere to run, though he wanted to. There was no solace to take in his conscience, no friend he could turn to. So like a switch, all judgments turned off, all sense of right and wrong had left, his fortress of good will abandoned. He had been broken.
