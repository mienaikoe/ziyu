Kip secretly boards the train, and they both meet up right before going in. Kip gets punishment of going on the rescue mission, Lif gets punishment of Ara instead of Ulu, where she learns how to protect against radiation and low pressure.

## Chapter 4



  The station was just filling up for the next train after the day's first nap. I was feeling sluggish from biking around and skipping lunch and sleep, so I settled for a savory kadja roll from the bakery my parents used to take me to. I ate it squatting and leaning against a tree near the tracks, hiding from the wind and from Kip if he had decided to follow me. *This is the right thing*, I affirmed to myself. *No externalities. No liabilities*. I thought about the crops I had just planted. Whether Mel would ask Tig to work on them. Whether she would kill them out of spite, or replant them in her own field. If this is as important as Jes says, then those crops don't matter in the scheme of things. Heiko would understand.

  The station attendant called for us through a flathorn, "Train to Shaki approaching. All passengers prepare for marshalling."

  I quickly put away my roll and jumped the wall to the marshalling side. The attendant was tall for a Maman with a recent flow tattoo mutating into hundreds of threads of infrared across hae neck. I admired it from afar as I shifted into the line for the 9th car. I had gotten a flow tattoo once, but working in the constant light of Ara made my skin's water vessels flow too quickly, so it just looked like my skin was striped in a brownish color. My parents just laughed and told me about how they had tried it too when they were kids, and had the same results.

  The train came rumbling in with its engines and brakes humming with electrical blood. Thi called again, "Train to Shaki. Stops in Thina, Rudjan Ara, Rudjan Ulu, Yansha, Shaki Harbor, Shaki Central," and we fell into a tighter line against the wall.

  "Excuse me, could you help me into the train?"

  Behind me was a older man with a splinted leg. He looked up me with a smile that I had to return, and I leant my hand to him to climb the steps into the carriage.

  "Thank you, my kaln," he said.

  I laughed, "I haven't been called a kaln in ages."

  "Oh, at my age, everyone is a child."

  *I suppose that's true.*

  The seats were mostly empty but I took one across the carriage from the man - far enough not to creep him out - and put my bag down in the next seat. The sun and wind had grown to its mid-day peak, but the reinforced curtains made them both much more pleasant for a long ride. The man was finding a good spot for his legs as the seats weren't exactly spacious enough for him, but he eventually settled on a position.

  "In all my years of riding trains, they've never built at least one spacious seat for people like me."

  "I imagine it's because none of them are living with your problem," I said.

  "An ounce of empathy is all I ask for. If more people were like you, we would be much better off."

  "Charming a young maman? At your age?"

  "I'm often told that I say too much of what I mean. Some may consider it charming, I suppose."

  "Well, I believe that too many of my generation are afraid to speak, so I'm glad you're still around."

  He chortled, "Charming an old man. At your age?"
  I laughed. It was loud and it was awkward, but I knew he wouldn't mind.
  He began again, "so what's taking you to the capital?"

  I froze a bit, stuttering, but said "My wife works there. Just bringing her something."

  "Ahh. Surprising your wife. I bet she'll be excited."
  "Heh. Yea. I hope she receives it well."
  "A good wife would be happy that you had the thought to brighten her work day."
  "Well we haven't been too happy with each other lately, so I hope you're right."
  "Yes, that will happen from time to time. I still remember a time we were all fighting about what to cook for dinner, and we didn't speak to each other for weeks afterward. It's silly how the small decisions are always the most difficult to agree on."
