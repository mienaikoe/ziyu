Kip secretly boards the train, and they both meet up right before going in. Kip gets punishment of going on the rescue mission, Lif gets punishment of Ara instead of Ulu, where she learns how to protect against radiation and low pressure.

  "Hey Lif! It's been a while," Gom greeted me kindly.
  "Hey Gom, how's the oven treating you?"
  "Oh, just reminding me how hot Ara is whenever I move my arm the wrong way."
  His comedy was welcome for

  <!--We gave them pohua whenever they needed a sweeter taste, and they supplied us with breads for our meals. I had a brief crush on Gom, their daughter, so I would ask to visit them often, but she had moved to Lahfa province to work on mining instead of staying in the family business. The bakery had been passed down to a new family that focused more on lunch items for travelers once the train industry picked up, so they no longer needed Pohua.

    The station was just filling up for the next train after the day's first nap. I was feeling sluggish from running around and skipping lunch and sleep, so I settled for a savory kadja roll from the bakery my parents used to take me to. I ate squatting and leaning against a tree near the tracks, hiding from the wind and from Kip if he had decided to follow me. *This is the right thing*, I affirmed to myself. *No externalities. No liabilities*. I thought about the crops I had just planted. Whether Mel would ask Tig to work on them. Whether she would kill them out of spite, or replant them in her own field. If this is as important as Jes says, then those crops don't matter in the scheme of things. Heiko would understand.
    The station attendant called for us through his flathorn, "Train to Shaki approaching. All passengers prepare for marshalling."
    I quickly put away my roll and jumped the wall to the marshalling side. The attendant was tall for a Maman with a recent flow tattoo mutating into several threads of infrared across hae neck. I admired it from afar as I shifted into the line for the 9th car. I had gotten a flow tattoo once, but working in the constant light of Ara made my skin's water vessels flow too quickly, so it just looked like my skin was striped in a brownish color. My parents just laughed and told me about how they had tried it too when they were kids, and had the same results.
    The train came rumbling in with its engines and brakes humming electric. Thi called again, "Train to Shaki. Stops in Thina, Rudjan Ara, Rudjan Ulu, Yansha, and Shaki."
