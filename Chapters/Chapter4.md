Kip secretly boards the train, and they both meet up right before going in. Kip gets punishment of going on the rescue mission, Lif gets punishment of Ara instead of Ulu, where she learns how to protect against radiation and low pressure.

  "Hey Lif! It's been a while," Gom greeted me kindly.
  "Hey Gom, how's the oven treating you?"
  "Oh, just reminding me how hot Ara is whenever I move my arm the wrong way."

  The station was just filling up for the next train after the day's first nap. I was feeling sluggish from running around and skipping lunch and sleep, so I settled for a savory kadja roll from the bakery my parents used to take me to. We gave them pohua whenever they needed a sweeter taste in pastries, and they supplied us with breads for our meals. I had a brief crush on Gom, their daughter, so I would ask to visit them often, but she had moved to Lahfa province to work on mining instead of carrying the baking torch. The bakery had been passed down to a new family that focused more on lunch items for travelers once the train industry picked up, so they no longer needed Pohua.
  I ate squatting and leaning against a tree near the tracks, hiding from the chilly wind that was alive and well, and Kip if he had decided to follow me. *This is the right thing*, I affirmed to myself. *No externalities. No liabilities*. I thought about the crops I had just planted. Whether Mel would make a deal with Tig to work on them. Whether she would kill them out of spite, or claim them as her own. If this is as important as Jes says, then those crops don't matter in the scheme of things. The village would understand. Heiko would understand.
