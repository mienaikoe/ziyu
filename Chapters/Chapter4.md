Kip secretly boards the train, and they both meet up right before going in. Kip gets punishment of going on the rescue mission, Lif gets punishment of Ara instead of Ulu, where she learns how to protect against radiation and low pressure.

## Chapter 4



  The station was just filling up for the next train after the day's first nap. I was feeling sluggish from biking around and skipping lunch and sleep, so I settled for a savory kadja roll from the bakery my parents used to take me to. I ate it squatting and leaning against a tree near the tracks, hiding from the wind and from Kip if he had decided to follow me. *This is the right thing*, I affirmed to myself. *No externalities. No liabilities*. I thought about the crops I had just planted. Whether Mel would ask Tig to work on them. Whether she would kill them out of spite, or replant them in her own field. If this is as important as Jes says, then those crops don't matter in the scheme of things. Heiko would understand.

  The station attendant called for us through a flathorn, "Train to Shaki approaching. All passengers prepare for marshalling."

  I quickly put away my roll and jumped the wall to the marshalling side. The attendant was tall for a Maman with a recent flow tattoo mutating into hundreds of threads of infrared across hae neck. I admired it from afar as I shifted into the line for the 9th car. I had gotten a flow tattoo once, but working in the constant light of Ara made my skin's water vessels flow too quickly, so it just looked like my skin was striped in a brownish color. My parents just laughed and told me about how they had tried it too when they were kids, and had the same results.

  The train came rumbling in with its engines and brakes humming with electrical blood. Thi called again, "Train to Shaki. Stops in Thina, Rudjan Ara, Rudjan Ulu, Yansha, Shaki Harbor, Shaki Central," and we fell into a tighter line against the wall.

  "Excuse me, could you help me into the train?"

  Behind me was a older man with a splinted leg. He looked up me with a smile that I had to return, and I leant my hand to him to climb the steps into the carriage.

  "Thank you, my kaln," he said.

  I laughed, "I haven't been called a kaln in ages."

  "Oh, at my age, everyone is a child."

  *I suppose that's true.*

  The seats were mostly empty but I took one across the carriage from the man - far enough not to creep him out - and put my bag down in the next seat. The sun and wind had grown to its mid-day peak, but the reinforced curtains made them both much more pleasant for a long ride. The man was finding a good spot for his legs as the seats weren't exactly spacious enough for an extended leg, but he eventually settled on a position.

  "In all my years of riding trains, they've never built at least one spacious seat for people of my condition."

  "Maybe none of them are living with your problem," I said.

  "A sliver of empathy from them and an old man could sit in peace. Instead, a patient sweet maman like you has to bear my complaints."

  "Charming a young maman? At your age?"

  "I'm often told that I say too much of what I mean. Some may consider it charming, I suppose."

  "Well, I believe that too many of my generation are afraid to speak, so I'm glad you're around to set us straight."

  He chortled, "Charming an old man. At your age?"

  I laughed. It was loud and it was awkward, but I knew he wouldn't mind.

  He began again, "so what's taking you to the capital?"

  I froze a bit, stuttering, but said "My wife works there. Just bringing her something."

  "Ahh. Surprising your wife. I bet she'll be excited," he said.

  "Heh. Yea. I hope she receives it well."

  "A good wife would be happy that you thought to brighten her day like that."

  "Well we haven't been too happy with each other lately, so I hope you're right."

  "Yes, that will happen from time to time. I still remember once we were all fighting about a color to paint our kaln's bike. We didn't speak to each other for weeks afterward. We couldn't let it go until some point when we woke up, as if from a daydream."

  "Did you ever have one that you never woke up from?"

  He paused and looked at me as if he had seen a younger version of himself in me.

  "...Perhaps we should stop now."

  "I don't mean to pry into your past, but if there's a shred of advice you can give me, it would be greatly appreciated."

  "I will tell you something that helped me once, long ago. Don't ask a cripple for advice."

  "Funny joke, but I am being sincere. I don't have anyone to ask about this."

  "Can't you ask your parents for advice? I don't like to get into family squabbles like this."

  "My mother died right before I got married, and my remaining parents disbanded after that." I said. I hoped that opening up to him would make him do the same.

  "Oh no. That's terrible..." He said, visibly uncomfortable. I paused for a bit to see if he would follow up with anything.

  He did, "Well you did a splendid job raising yourself. Must be those child-rearing instincts you maman have that got you through it."

  "They aren't instincts. We learn them just like any other skill."

  "Oh but all of you are so good at it."

  "We spend a lot of time doing it. If men and women helped us, I think they would be great at it too," I retorted.

  He sighed, "We all have a place in society."

  I turned forward and stopped talking before I said something I would regret. He returned his head back to the curtain, staring between stitches at bright void of Ara. Like a switch, we returned to being strangers on the train.

  "Yansha! Approaching Yansha!" The conductor barreled in and blurted into the car. I pulled over both of my eyelids and rejoined reality.
  "Yansha! Approaching Yan-," He repeated to the next car as the door closed behind him. *Yansha? I must have missed a few stops.* I sat more upright and glanced at the older man in the next seat, sleeping with his leg on the seat across. The scene through the screen was dark, but I could make out some trees amongst the hills and houses in the distance.
