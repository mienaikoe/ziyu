# Chapter 22

<!-- 

submarine is a smaller portion of the whole.

A bunch of them land and round people up to the station

they form a wall toward the north

the heikoans flee to the south, and Holragi can't catch up. Some are lost by musket.

*Plink... Plink.*

The door above Melna dripped directly onto her head on the short ride to Heiko in a small submarine. Her mind was wandering upon that woman's path. Jumping off of Shinna's boat. Swimming through the kind of cold most Pangum would certainly perish in. She wondered if she made it to shore or if the water turned her spirit into a wave. She deserved to be a tall one, sweeping fishers and kelpers off their feet when they weren't paying attention. They would know her well when she came around. They would listen to her when she was speaking.

Perhaps she was there with her, in the drops of ocean from the broken door of that small submarine. Or perhaps she survived, far away from the water. A whole life waiting for her in the light. One more fulfilling than the suffering she knew so well.

"When we land, we head straight to the conduit," said Fajro, repeating himself. "I'll speak first."

"You're nervous"

"Don't get cheeky," he said. She let it go but he wouldn't. "Holragians don't get nervous," he said.

She paused to look at him closer, to eye the deep fissures and splotches of his face, the marks of a man who had worked hard for the privilege of working harder. 

"You know," she said, "I used to wear paosin patches that Kip used to give me. Worked wonders for my nerves."

"A senator using illegal narcotics. Now that's quite the scandal. Did you ever tell Liffa?"

"It was better thi didn't know."

"What other secrets are wrapped up in that clever head of yours, I wonder."

"Yes," she replied. "I suppose a man of your cleverness might skip deduction and head straight to wonder."

He scoffed, understanding her meaning more than her words, and returned to writing in a small notebook in his hands.

The small craft came to against the sand, minor scraping sounds echoing through the thick metal shell. "We're here," said Fajro, and one of the pilots began turning a knob to unblock the door that had been leaking on Melna. She thanked the pilot, to which thi gave a vacant glance and turned back to hae seat in the front of the cabin. *Must be following orders.* The door lifted with some resistance, and she emerged a few paces from the shore on a beach near Heiko harbor. 

She quickly found that she was not alone. Nearly sixty other ships like theirs had landed on the shore and unleashed their Holragian occupants, all of them armed with guns and covered with zaikara hard feather armor. A mechanical hum added to the commotion as Fajro emerged behind her and quickly joined her. He had a smile on his face as he watched his soldiers storming the city.

"You've certainly brought some friends with you."

"Just cooperate," he said, "and nobody will be hurt."

"You waste your breath with empty promises."

"You really are a stubborn one, Melna. I am a man of my word, and this partnership will be the first of manyâ€“"

"This is an invasion, not a partnership."

"Well, I suppose that's up to you," he said, turning his head toward the city. He held out his hand toward the timelight tower that hung above the train station square, signalling for Melna to walk in front of him, but she refused.

"I will not deliver a speech of surrender at the place of my oath-taking."

"What better place for them to trust you than to be reminded of your authority."

"A Heiko senator carries duty over authority. My duty today will be to ensure their safety in this process, and they will be looking to me to do that." 

"So let them look up while they do."

"No. My people do not look up or down to anyone. I will hear me at the pier."

He tossed up his hands and said, "Suit yourself," then gestured to two soldiers that were standing by. They turned and ran toward the square, seemingly to spread the new orders.

"But the order remains. I speak first," he commanded. "And Remember. What you say and what you do in the next few moments determines the lives of all Heikoans. And my patience is growing thin."

"Yes. Of course," she said, trying her best to hide her true feelings.

A soldier from their submarine shoved her forward and she began walking across the beach toward the entrance of the grand pier. The sand that had always been kind to tread upon now filled her feet with a cold that traveled along the marrow, stiffening her joints with each cold step.

<!-- Melna dies? Gets a mortal wound, ambiguous if death or not. -->
