## Chapter 22

<!--

submersible is a smaller portion of the whole.

A bunch of them land and round people up to the station

they form a wall toward the north

the Heikoi flee to the south, and Holrag can't catch up. Some are lost by musket.

_Plink... Plink._

A steady drip of water counted time on Melna's forehead during the short ride to Heiko in a small submersible. Her mind wandered to the people she'd stumbled upon in her path, all the secrets she'd been told and technology she'd gained, and that mysterious maman who couldn't die. Jumping off of Shinna's boat, swimming in a cold that most Throngia would perish in. She wondered if the ocean fables were true, that in drowning your spirit is infused with the ocean. She imagined the maman swimming through the tallest waves, sweeping fishers and kelpers off their feet when they aren't paying attention. They would know hae well when thi came around. They would fear hae as thi spoke.

Perhaps thi was there with her, in the drops of ocean from the broken door of that small submersible. Or perhaps thi survived, hiding in the space between Heiko and Rudjan; a whole life waiting for hae in the last remnants of the light.

"When we land, we head straight to the conduit," said Fajro, repeating himself. "I'll speak first."

"You're nervous," she observed.

"Don't get cheeky," he said without looking at her.

She paused to look at him closer, peered into the deep fissures and splotches of his face, the marks of a man who had worked hard for the privilege of working harder. And she saw something else.

"When did the paosin stop working."

He immediately shot her a scowl and said, "You'll learn to keep your mouth shut, woman."

"An ex-fidelant using illegal narcotics. Now that's quite the scandal."

"I know my limits. And that's far better than I can say for Heikoi. One giant Paosin den, the lot of you."

"We take care of every one instead of letting them spend the rest of their lives in a haze."

"And how does pandering to the socially inept help anyone?"

She knew the conversation was a dead end, so she held her tongue.

"Those who cannot control their own minds deserve to perish by them," he said as he kept his gaze fixed upon the small window at the front of the craft, where he sat.

"A society that refuses to help its members in need deserves to perish along with them."

"The wicked belong to the soil. The worms would make better use of their bodies."

The hull of their vehicle scraped against the sand as it came to a stop. The crashing of waves and a murmur of the Heikoan accent told her that they'd arrived near the city.

The pilot rose from hae chair and stood in front of Melna, turning a knob to open the leaky door above her. She thanked hae as thi turned back to hae seat, and thi gave a nervous glance of acknowledgement.

"After me," Fajro told her, waving his hand as he stood up and moved just below the opened hatch. A rope with a loop was lowered into the vessel and he placed his good foot into it, using the loop as a sort of stirrup. A soldier pushed Melna toward the hole to get ready for the next rope. She felt an intense wave of anxiety when she thought of showing up with such news and under such circumstances.

She held tightly to the rope and emerged on the top of a metal vessel, just a step from a small pier in the harbor where hundreds of Heikoi ships lay sleeping at their docks. But all along the sand, nearly sixty other ships like theirs had landed on the shore and emptied their Holragi occupants onto the beach; all of them armed with guns and dressed in thick armor made from the feathers of the zaikara bird. The night air was still with the aroma of anomin smoke, telling of the lights she'd seen from afar.

Above her, already on the pier, Fajro had a smile on his face as he watched his soldiers storming the city.

"You've certainly brought some friends with you," she said to him soberly, unbothered by seeing her home overrun.

"Just cooperate," he said, "and no one will come to harm. This partnership will be the first of many–"

"This is an invasion, not a partnership."

"Well now," he said, turning his head toward the city. "I suppose that's up to you."

He held out his hand, pointing toward the road that led to the station square, signalling for Melna to walk in front of him.

"What better place than the place of your oath-taking. They will be reminded of your authority."

"A fidelant holds duty above authority. They will be looking to me for answers."

"So let them be reminded of your importance while they do."

"žah-Fajro, you should like to remember that the Heikoi do not measure the value of a life. I am no more important than the farmer selling hae harvest nor the doctor minding his patients."

He tossed up his hands and said, "Fine. Where is good for you then?"

She smiled as if conjuring some plan in her head. "Here. Where the ocean weathers the sand. I'll speak upon the pier there." She pointed toward a wide, wooden deck that towered over the water below. A broad sloped clearing of stone was set into the sand where several piers adjoined the land, with room for thousands in a crowd.

Fajro gestured to two soldiers and they ran toward the station square.

"But the order remains," he commanded, "I speak first."

"Yes. Of course," she said.

"Remember your place in all this, Melna. The wrong words could cost you everything."

"And the same goes for you," she responded with a tone of confidence. Without looking, she knew that a scowl rested upon his face. She wondered if he knew.

The sand on the beach had always been kind to tread upon but now it filled her feet with the sort of cold that travels along the empty spaces in bones and freezes in the joints. As they approached the larger pier, disparate groups of throngia and saffa began to gather. She watched with anger as the soldiers corralled them with loud orders and cracks in the air. Many were in the first stages of malnourishment, with their eyes sunken and their limbs trembling in the cold.

When the Heikoi saw her, they were aghast at seeing their fidelant dressed in robes amongst hostile company. Some of them stared at her with hostile eyes, not seeing anything that would calm their concerns. Still others held their arms out and cried for her, knowing that she would sooner die than betray them. Her own face flushed with small droplets from the pores in her hydroderm, but she quickly stopped herself; they needed to see her strength to know their own.

From the crowd she spotted Jesse and Thimlu who put their hands on their chests in solidarity with her. She wanted so badly to run to them, to hold their hands in communion and tell them everything she'd learned. But a nod would have to do, she thought. A nod would be enough.

Upon the first few staves of the pier, a small group of soldiers had gathered around a table to set up some strange electrical equipment that had wires running to their small submersible back on the beach. Through the crowd, the soldiers were handing out small devices that resembled listeners.

"The whole world will want to hear what we have to say," said Fajro.

Melna's stare was focused on her people. From her satchel, she produced the wooden listener that Fanla had dropped for her at the gates of Rudjan, and surreptitiously placed it on the ear furthest from Fajro. There was a pattern in the static that she hadn't heard before.

A soldier came up to Fajro and said, "Sir, we are ready for the broadcast."

"Yes," he said, adjusting his coat impatiently. "Yes, let's begin."

He moved to a position in front of the table, with the people of Heiko before him and took a microphone from a table near the equipment. He waited with a patronizing smile as all of the crowd anxiously put the listeners to their ears for the first time. At the back of the crowd, Melna spotted a familiar face meandering through the people to get closer to Melna. She thought she was seeing things, but once she had come close enough, Pomri's smile became unmistakeable. A wide, broken smile beamed across Melna's face for the first time in what felt like an eternity. Without taking her eyes off of Melna, Pomri settled into a pocket of the crowd near the front.

"Good evening. I am Fajro um Holrag. Former fidelant for Holrag and primary benefactor of the Holragi Spacerail. I stand before the people of Heiko today, with your dearest fidelant Melna, to bring great news to both our peoples. We are also broadcasting this over the air to every conduit in the twelve provinces. This announcement will truly be a pivotal moment in the history of our world."

He smiled at the crowd, expecting the sounds of awe and wonder, but there was only one emotion on their minds at that moment: worry. He quickly stopped smiling and continued.

"On behalf of my colleague Melna, I would like to announce that Holrag has uncovered the secrets of the obscura, and we are now planning countermeasures to fight off our mutual enemy."

Some in the crowd grew excited at this news, but most remained skeptical, waiting for Melna to comment before judging its trustworthiness.

"As you know, this enemy is like nothing we've ever seen before. And to fight it requires us to cooperate in radical ways; to pool our resources into a project larger than anything our planet has ever seen. Now, Holrag and Heiko have had our differences, but we knew that we had to work through them, that there was no time to quarrel over details. In a bold act of unity, Melna has pledged the services of Heiko to the Holrag, forging a strong alliance to help us all accomplish this herculean effort in time."

He waited for some sort of excited sound, but the crowd remained silent, trying to fully understand what he was telling them.

"Together, we will build a fortress in the sand: a shelter for all the world's inhabitants where we can wait comfortably until the obscura subsides. There is no greater cause than the survival of our species, and I am immensely proud of all of Heiko for answering the call. I'd now like to invite Melna who will speak about this historic alliance."

He passed the microphone listener to Melna who manufactured the best smile of acceptance she could muster. He walked behind her, standing very close in case she tried anything again. To his right was the operator who he'd berated for acting slowly. He whispered to hae, "Be ready to cut on my signal."

Melna rose the microphone to her mouth and looked at her people. _This will be my last address_, she thought. _Best not to hesitate_.

She began.

"Friends. Heikoi. Pangum of Palinan."

Pomri suddenly stood up and permeated the crowd, slowly weaving in and out of people and whispering something to them. On the listener, the pattern in the static was louder, but she paid no mind to it.

<!-- left off -->

"There's something I've always admired about our spirit. We don't give up in the face of adversity. We cooperate to accomplish a greater good. And most importantly, we sacrifice everything to do what is right. I was asked just a few moments ago to deliver a speech about how we are coming together to create the greatest weapon ever made against our greatest foe. But I want to first talk a bit about why we need this weapon. For years our peoples fought over territory on what little we have of this precious ring of green. Until finally we realized we would all be much better off if we shared our goods with each other and through reasoning and diplomacy, we achieved a lasting peace. This new enemy believes themselves superior to us. We cannot reason with them, for they refuse to communicate. We cannot trade because they would rather take everything that we have. But I want you all to remember this. We will not back down. No matter the circumstances. We will survive this together."

Some in the crowd cheered, and Fajro went to pull the listener away, but Melna stepped away from him and held her arm out to fend him off. By now, the beating hum was much louder and clearer, and she could almost make out the sound "U. Lu".

"Behind you is Ara. It has long been a symbol of life and vitality, but now it is dying and there is little we can do to stop it."

Fajro whispered loudly to her, "Melna, there is no time for this," But she persisted. She knew the plan now. This was her moment.

"As you look to me for guidance, I want you to stand tall and look even further, for I will no longer be with you. Before you, I stand on a pier that harbors ships into the cold, dark sea of Ulu. It has always been a dangerous and unknown place, but I need you to trust me when I tell you that the future of Heiko is waiting for you behind this fog."

"Cut it!" Fajro yelled to the solider, but he was too late, as Melna had shoved the maman away from hae equipment. Fajro reached for her, but she unsheathed a dagger from her robes and used his momentum to pin him against her with the dagger at his neck.

"Run! Run! Run!" Melna yelled into the listener as she slowly backed away down the pier with Fajro in her arms. As if on cue, the crowd immediately rushed into the water as Pomri and the woman subdued soldiers who were trying to hold people back with the aid of a few from the crowd who stayed behind. Three explosions cracked the air and two mamen on the beach fell to the ground, blood and water quickly filling their clothes. A man quickly came to their aid as the rest continued fighting.

Behind her, thunderous horns filled the air as an armada of war boats filled to the brim with glowing blue paddlers appeared from the mist and cut through the water toward the outer line of the blockade. They tossed hooks and ropes onto the boats and poured themselves into the furthest ships of the blockade, taking them with ease. A handful of Holrag soldiers on the coast rushed to their submersibles, returning to protect the bigger ship.

"You've doomed them all," Fajro spoke roughly as she pulled him down the pier. "We could have had something great." Fifty soldiers, all with hand muskets, pointed them at Melna, waiting for a clear shot.

"We still can," she said, finally relieved of her duties. "But not like this."

She could feel the burn on her skin turning raw and opening up to the blood that had gathered underneath. She winced with each step backward, pushed it out of her mind.

"The ones who come after will do what we couldn't. They will learn to temper their differences. They will understand and overcome the obscura. They will be better than we could be."

"They will all die," said Fajro. "You heard Liffa... it is... immovable... impenetrable."

"If you come to a wall, it is far easier to go around it. The obscura must become a part of who we are."

"You know a way?"

"My, how the tables have turned," she smiled, acknowledging how bittersweet this end had become.

"Tell me!" he begged, "I'll bring Liffa back! I'll disperse the blockade! W-Whatever you want."

"No," She responded without pause, "You have forsaken your confidence, and sullied the name of the Fidelity. Your secrets end here."

"Wait!"

With a sudden jab of his elbow he pushed her knife away and twisted out of her chokehold, narrowly missing the blade, and tumbled toward the edge of the pier. Melna saw she had become vulnerable, so she ran toward Fajro amidst the gunfire and jumped off the pier, catching his leg on the way down to pull him under the water with her. The water froze and the salt stung against her newly-opened burns and she screamed out in pain as they fell deeper, but still she held on to Fajro's leg as he kicked against her to surface. She felt a tightness in her side, and then a pain that leaked the warmth out of her body into the water. It didn't matter anymore. She had to finish what she had surrendered herself for. She looked around for Fajro above her and tugged hard on his leg, sending him flailing downard and her up to meet him. Her grip released from his leg and took his arm instead, holding it true and letting her other hand lay the blade to rest upon his neck. It was done.

The soldiers were recovering his body when she last saw his lifeless face staring back at her between the volley of light rays wedging their way between the rafters. In the shallows beneath the pier, not fifty paces away, she lay beneath the sand, clinging to the bullet wound in her side and looking out toward the water. Upon the waves, not too far off, the blue lights of the Guardians of Ulukoma darted with urgency in their new found vessels, fetching children and elders and adults, one after the other, from the icy clutches of the ocean. Ahead of them, the forward ram of Shinna's ship shone brightly as it held a blockade of its own against the Holragi behemoth.

She smiled.

Just before drifting off, she whispered a silent benediction to the people she had never met who shed their fears and risked their lives to save a people they did not know. In her fading consciousness, she felt Kipnu's warm presence wrap around her and through her as the last thought in her mind transpired into the wind.

"Good morning. Liffa."
