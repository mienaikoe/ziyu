# Chapter 22

<!--

submersible is a smaller portion of the whole.

A bunch of them land and round people up to the station

they form a wall toward the north

the heikoans flee to the south, and Holragi can't catch up. Some are lost by musket.

*Plink... Plink.*

The door above Melna dripped directly onto her head on the short ride to Heiko in a small submersible. Her mind was wandering upon that woman's path. Jumping off of Shinna's boat. Swimming through the kind of cold most Pangum would certainly perish in. She wondered if she made it to shore or if the water turned her spirit into a wave. She deserved to be a tall one, sweeping fishers and kelpers off their feet when they weren't paying attention. They would know her well when she came around. They would listen to her when she was speaking.

Perhaps she was there with her, in the drops of ocean from the broken door of that small submersible. Or perhaps she survived, far away from the water. A whole life waiting for her in the light. One more fulfilling than the suffering she knew so well.

"When we land, we head straight to the conduit," said Fajro, repeating himself. "I'll speak first."

"You're nervous," she observed.

"Don't get cheeky," he said without looking at her. "I don't get nervous," he said.

She paused to look at him closer. She peered into the deep fissures and splotches of his face, the marks of a man who had worked hard for the privilege of working harder. And she saw something else.

"When did the Paosin stop working."

He immediately shot her a scowl and said, "You'll learn to keep your mouth shut, woman."

"An ex-senator using illegal narcotics. Now that's quite the scandal."

"You're one to speak. Heiko is practically one giant Paosin den."

"Because we keep track of every one of them instead of sweep them under the rug."

"Oh yea? And how does that help anything?"

She had no time to come up with a response, so he continued.

"Those who cannot control their own minds deserve to perish by them."

"A society that refuses to help its members in need deserves to perish along with them. The sick belong in a hospital."

"The sick belong in the ground. Worms would make better use of their bodies."

The small craft came to against the sand, minor scraping sounds echoing through the thick metal shell. "We're here," said Fajro, and one of the pilots began turning a knob to unblock the door that had been leaking on Melna. She thanked the pilot, to which thi gave a vacant glance and turned back to hae seat in the front of the cabin. The door lifted with some resistance, and she emerged a few paces from the shore on a beach near Heiko harbor.

She quickly found that she was not alone. Nearly sixty other ships like theirs had landed on the shore and unleashed their Holragian occupants, all of them armed with guns and covered with zaikara hard feather armor. A mechanical hum added to the commotion as Fajro emerged behind her and quickly joined her. He had a smile on his face as he watched his soldiers storming the city.

"You've certainly brought some friends with you."

"Just cooperate," he said, "and nobody will be hurt."

"You waste your breath with empty promises."

"You really are a stubborn one, Melna. I am a man of my word, and this partnership will be the first of manyâ€“"

"This is an invasion, not a partnership."

"Well, I suppose that's up to you," he said, turning his head toward the city. He held out his hand toward the timelight tower that hung above the train station square, signalling for Melna to walk in front of him, but she refused.

"I will not deliver a speech of surrender at the place of my oath-taking."

"What better place for them to trust you than to be reminded of your authority."

"A Heiko senator carries duty over authority. My duty today will be to ensure their safety in this process, and they will be looking to me to do that."

"So let them look up while they do."

"No. My people do not look up or down to anyone. I will hear me at the pier."

He tossed up his hands and said, "Suit yourself," then gestured to two soldiers that were standing by. They turned and ran toward the square, seemingly to spread the new orders.

"But the order remains. I speak first," he commanded.

"Yes. Of course," she said, doing her best to hide her feelings.

"Today, you will change the lives of your people forever. Be sure to choose wisely."

A soldier from their submersible shoved her forward and she began walking across the beach toward the point where the sand met one side of the grand pier. The sand that had always been kind to tread upon now filled her feet with cold, traveling along the marrow and the empty spaces in her shins and stiffening her joints with each cold step. She watched with anger as the people of Heiko's city center were summoned from their homes, sometimes forcefully, and gathered at the mouth of the pier. They were visibly malnourished, relying only on new crops that grew under the light of the obscura and what little stockpiles of dried stone fruits had remained of their last shipment from Yansha. Her face flushed with tiny tears from the pores in her hydroderm, but she stopped herself lest Fajro use it against her.

As she approached the pier, the people were aghast at seeing Melna dressed in robes amongst hostile company. Some of them heckled her, calling her "traitor!" and "coward!". But others could see through to what was really happening, and they cried for her. From the crowd she spotted Thimlu, the astronomer, and Jes, the messenger who put their hands on their chests in solidarity with her. She quickly warmed her face and gave them a nod as if to communicate a secret. They did not know the secret she was speaking of, but had a feeling that things were not as simple as they seemed.

Upon the first few staves of the fog-worn pier, a small group of soldiers had gathered around a table to set up some strange electrical equipment that had wires running to their small submersible docked to the pier.

"The whole world will want to hear what we have to say," said Fajro.

Melna's stare was focused on her people. "I want them all to have radios."

"You what?"

"If you want the whole world to hear us then let's start with the people we are addressing."

He hesitated, balking at the idea.

"You've got a loud voice, haven't you?"

"Not in the wind."

He let out a grunt of frustration, "This is why I wanted to do this in the square."

"We do it here. With radios," she commanded.

He stared at her for a moment and then gave an order to a group of soldiers standing near the electrical equipment.

"Any other demands, my queen?"

"Yes. Quit being such a whiny bitch."

"Excuse me?"

"This was your idea. Start acting like it."

A soldier came up to Fajro and said, "Sir, we are ready for the broadcast."

"Yes," he said, still staring at Melna with disdain in his eyes. "Yes, let's begin."

He moved to a position in front of the table, with the people of Heiko before him and took a microphone listener from a table near the equipment. He waited with a patronizing smile as all of the crowd anxiously put the listeners to their ears for the first time. At the back of the crowd, Melna spotted a familiar face meandering through the people to get closer to Melna. She thought she was seeing things, but once Pomri had come close enough, they both silently grinned at each other. Pomri accepted a listener and didn't take her eyes off of Melna even as Fajro began.

"Good evening. I am Fajro um Holragi. Former senator for Holragi and primary benefactor of the space rail project. I stand before the people of Heiko today, with former Heiko senator Melna with great news." *Former?* "We are also broadcasting this over the air to every conduit in the world. This announcement will truly be a pivotal moment in the history of our world."

He smiled at the crowd, expecting looks of awe and wonder, but only receiving the blank stares of worry. He quickly stopped smiling and continued.

"On behalf of my colleague Melna, I would like to announce that Holragi has uncovered the secrets of the obscura, and are now planning a counterattack against them."

Some in the crowd had become joyful at this news, but most remained skeptical, waiting for Melna to comment before judging its trustworthiness.

"As part of this effort, our people must unite to construct a weapon larger than we have ever built. In a pledge of service, Heiko has forged a strong alliance with Holragi. To help us all accomplish this herculean effort in time. I'd like to invite Melna who will now speak about this historic alliance."

"I'd like to call up the people whose advice helped me make this historic decision."

"Pomri, Thimlu, Jesse, Linyu."

"You will lead them into the fog. Do not look back. Do not stop."

<!-- People run, some die, some are captured, most make it to the fog -->
<!-- Melna dies? Gets a mortal wound, ambiguous if death or not. -->
