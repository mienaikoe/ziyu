# Chapter 22

*Plink... Plink.*

The door above Melna dripped directly onto her head on the short ride to Heiko in a cramped submarine. Her mind was wandering upon that woman's path. Jumping off of Shinna's boat. Swimming through the kind of cold most Pangum would certainly perish in. She wondered if she made it to shore or if the water turned her spirit into a wave. She deserved to be a tall one, sweeping fishers and kelpers off their feet when they weren't paying attention. They would know her well when she came around. They would listen to her when she was speaking.

Perhaps she was there with her, in the drops of ocean from the broken door of that small submarine. Or perhaps she survived, far away from the water. A whole life waiting for her in the light. One more fulfilling than the suffering she knew so well.

"When we land, we head straight to the conduit," said Fajro, repeating himself. "I'll speak first."

"You're nervous"

"Don't get cheeky," he said. She let it go but he wouldn't. "Holragians don't get nervous," he said.

She paused to look at him closer, eyeing the deep fissures and splotches of his face, the marks of a man who had worked hard enough to become incapable of stopping. "You know, I used to wear paosin patches that Kip used to give me. Worked wonders for my nerves."

"A senator on illegal paosin patches. Now that's quite the scandal. Did you ever tell Liffa?"

"It was better thi didn't know."

"What other secrets are wrapped up in that clever head of yours, I wonder."

"Yes," she replied. "I suppose a man of your cleverness might skip deduction and head straight to wonder."

He scoffed, understanding her meaning more than her words, and returned to writing in a small notebook in his hands.

The small craft came to against the sand, minor scraping sounds echoing through the thick metal shell. "We're here," said Fajro, and one of the pilots began turning a knob to unblock the door that had been leaking on Melna. She thanked the pilot, to which thi gave a vacant glance and turned back to hae seat in the front of the cabin. *Must be following orders.* The door lifted with some resistance, and she emerged a few paces from the shore on a beach near Heiko harbor. *TODO: describe the beach*

<!-- Melna gives a speech. Commands them to run. -->
<!-- People run, some die, some are captured, most make it to the fog -->
<!-- Melna dies? Gets a mortal wound, ambiguous if death or not. -->
<!-- Heiko explodes, empty -->
