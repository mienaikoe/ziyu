## Chapter 22

<!--

submersible is a smaller portion of the whole.

A bunch of them land and round people up to the station

they form a wall toward the north

the heikoans flee to the south, and Holragi can't catch up. Some are lost by musket.

*Plink... Plink.*

The door above Melna dripped directly onto her head on the short ride to Heiko in a small submersible. Her mind was wandering upon that woman's path. Jumping off of Shinna's boat. Swimming through the kind of cold most Pangum would certainly perish in. She wondered if she made it to shore or if the water turned her spirit into a wave. She deserved to be a tall one, sweeping fishers and kelpers off their feet when they weren't paying attention. They would know her well when she came around. They would listen to her when she was speaking.

Perhaps she was there with her, in the drops of ocean from the broken door of that small submersible. Or perhaps she survived, far away from the water. A whole life waiting for her in the light. One more fulfilling than the suffering she knew so well.

"When we land, we head straight to the conduit," said Fajro, repeating himself. "I'll speak first."

"You're nervous," she observed.

"Don't get cheeky," he said without looking at her. "I don't get nervous," he said.

She paused to look at him closer. She peered into the deep fissures and splotches of his face, the marks of a man who had worked hard for the privilege of working harder. And she saw something else.

"When did the Paosin stop working."

He immediately shot her a scowl and said, "You'll learn to keep your mouth shut, woman."

"An ex-fidelant using illegal narcotics. Now that's quite the scandal."

"You're one to speak. Heiko is practically one giant Paosin den."

"Because we keep track of every one of them instead of sweep them under the rug."

"Oh yea? And how does that help anything?"

She had no time to come up with a response, so he continued.

"Those who cannot control their own minds deserve to perish by them."

"A society that refuses to help its members in need deserves to perish along with them. The sick belong in a hospital."

"The sick belong in the ground. Worms would make better use of their bodies."

The small craft came to against the sand, minor scraping sounds echoing through the thick metal shell. "We're here," said Fajro, and one of the pilots began turning a knob to unblock the door that had been leaking on Melna. She thanked the pilot, to which thi gave a vacant glance and turned back to hae seat in the front of the cabin. The door lifted with some resistance, and she emerged a few paces from the shore on a beach near Heiko harbor.

She quickly found that she was not alone. Nearly sixty other ships like theirs had landed on the shore and unleashed their Holragian occupants, all of them armed with guns and covered with zaikara hard feather armor. A mechanical hum added to the commotion as Fajro emerged behind her and quickly joined her. He had a smile on his face as he watched his soldiers storming the city.

"You've certainly brought some friends with you."

"Just cooperate," he said, "and nobody will be hurt."

"You waste your breath with empty promises."

"You really are a stubborn one, Melna. I am a man of my word, and this partnership will be the first of many–"

"This is an invasion, not a partnership."

"Well, I suppose that's up to you," he said, turning his head toward the city. He held out his hand toward the timelight tower that hung above the train station square, signalling for Melna to walk in front of him, but she refused.

"I will not deliver a speech of surrender at the place of my oath-taking."

"What better place for them to trust you than to be reminded of your authority."

"A Heiko fidelant carries duty over authority. My duty today will be to ensure their safety in this process, and they will be looking to me to do that."

"So let them look up while they do."

"No. My people do not look up or down to anyone. I will hear me at the pier."

He tossed up his hands and said, "Suit yourself," then gestured to two soldiers that were standing by. They turned and ran toward the square, seemingly to spread the new orders.

"But the order remains. I speak first," he commanded.

"Yes. Of course," she said, doing her best to hide her feelings.

"Today, you will change the lives of your people forever. Be sure to choose wisely."

A soldier from their submersible shoved her forward and she began walking across the beach toward the point where the sand met one side of the grand pier. The sand that had always been kind to tread upon now filled her feet with cold, traveling along the marrow and the empty spaces in her shins and stiffening her joints with each step. She watched with anger as the people of Heiko's city center were summoned from their homes, sometimes forcefully, and gathered at the mouth of the pier. They were visibly malnourished, relying only on new crops that grew under the light of the obscura and what little stockpiles of dried stone fruits had remained of their last shipment from Yansha. Her face flushed with tiny tears from the pores in her hydroderm, but she stopped herself lest Fajro use it against her.

As she approached the pier, the people were aghast at seeing Melna dressed in robes amongst hostile company. Some of them heckled her, calling her "traitor!" and "coward!". But others could see through to what was really happening, and they cried for her. From the crowd she spotted Thimlu, the astronomer, and Žesse, the messenger who put their hands on their chests in solidarity with her. She quickly warmed her face and gave them a nod as if to communicate a secret. They did not know the secret she was speaking of, but had a feeling that things were not as simple as they seemed.

Upon the first few staves of the fog-worn pier, a small group of soldiers had gathered around a table to set up some strange electrical equipment that had wires running to their small submersible docked to the pier.

"The whole world will want to hear what we have to say," said Fajro.

Melna's stare was focused on her people. "I want them all to have radios."

"You what?"

"If you want the whole world to hear us then let's start with the people we are addressing."

He hesitated, balking at the idea.

"You've got a loud voice, haven't you?"

"Not in the wind."

He let out a grunt of frustration, "This is why I wanted to do this in the square."

"We do it here. With radios," she commanded.

"Even if I wanted to, we don't have that many-"

"The radios, Fajro."

He stared at her for a moment and then gave an order to a group of soldiers standing near the electrical equipment.

"Any other demands?"

"Yes. Quit whining."

"Excuse me?"

"This was your idea. Start acting like it."

A soldier came up to Fajro and said, "Sir, we are ready for the broadcast."

"Yes," he said, adjusting his coat impatiently. "Yes, let's begin."

He moved to a position in front of the table, with the people of Heiko before him and took a microphone listener from a table near the equipment. He waited with a patronizing smile as all of the crowd anxiously put the listeners to their ears for the first time. At the back of the crowd, Melna spotted a familiar face meandering through the people to get closer to Melna. She thought she was seeing things, but once she had come close enough, Pomri's smile became unmistakeable, and Melna smiled for the first time in a while. She was with another woman, quite strong and dressed in kelp clothing. Melna couldn't help but wonder if she was the person that mysterious boy in Rudjan told her about. They both accepted listeners from a solider and settled into a pocket of the crowd near the center, never taking their eyes off of Melna even as Fajro began.

"Good evening. I am Fajro um Holragi. Former fidelant for Holragi and primary benefactor of the space rail project. I stand before the people of Heiko today, with former Heiko fidelant Melna with great news." *Former?* "We are also broadcasting this over the air to every conduit in the world. This announcement will truly be a pivotal moment in the history of our world."

He smiled at the crowd, expecting looks of awe and wonder, but only receiving the blank stares of worry. He quickly stopped smiling and continued.

"On behalf of my colleague Melna, I would like to announce that Holragi has uncovered the secrets of the obscura, and we are now planning countermeasures."

Some in the crowd had become joyful at this news, but most remained skeptical, waiting for Melna to comment before judging its trustworthiness.

"As part of this effort, the world must unite. To pool our resources into a project larger than anything this planet has ever seen. In an act of unity, Heiko has pledged its service to Holragi," *He wants to enslave all of us* "forging a strong alliance to help us all accomplish this herculean effort in time. Together, we will build a fortress in the sand. It will be a shelter for all the world's inhabitants where we can wait comfortable until the obscura subsides. I'd like to invite Melna who will now speak about this historic alliance."

He passed the microphone listener to Melna who manufactured the best smile of acceptance she could muster.

"You might have told me this earlier," she said to him under her breath.

He replied, "You never would have said yes."

He walked behind her and stood very close in case she tried anything again. Beside him stood one of the soldiers from their submersible who he turned to and whispered into hae ear, "Be ready to cut on my signal."

Melna rose the listener to her mouth and looked at her people. *This will be my last address to them*, she thought. *Best not to hesitate*.

She began.

"Friends. Heikoans. Pangum of Palinan."

She watched as Pomri and the woman both split up into the crowd, slowly passing through the crowd with no apparent destination. They were up to something, and she felt like she might know what.

" There's something I've always admired about our spirit. We don't give up in the face of adversity. We cooperate to accomplish a greater good. And most importantly, we sacrifice everything to do what is right. I was asked just a few moments ago to deliver a speech about how we are coming together to create the greatest weapon ever made against our greatest foe. But I want to first talk a bit about why we need this weapon. For years our peoples fought over territory on what little we have of this precious ring of green. Until finally we realized we would all be much better off if we shared our goods with each other and through reasoning and diplomacy, we achieved a lasting peace. This new enemy believes themselves superior to us. We cannot reason with them, for they refuse to communicate. We cannot trade because they would rather take everything that we have. But I want you all to remember this. We will not back down. No matter the circumstances. We will survive this together."

Some in the crowd cheered, and Fajro went to pull the listener away, but Melna stepped away from him and held her arm out to fend him off.

"Behind you is Ara. It has long been a symbol of life and vitality, but now it is dying and there is little we can do to stop it."

Fajro whispered loudly to her, "Melna, there is no time for this," But she persisted.

"As you look to me for guidance, I want you to stand tall and look further, for I will no longer be with you. Before you, I stand on a pier that harbors ships into the cold, dark sea of Ulu. It has always been a dangerous and unknown place, but I need you to trust me when I tell you that the future of Heiko is waiting for you behind the fog."

"Cut it!" Fajro yelled to the solider, but he was too late, as Melna had shoved the soldier away from hae equipment. Fajro reached for her, but she unsheathed a dagger from her robes and used his momentum to pin him against her with the dagger at his neck.

"Run! Run! Run!" Melna yelled into the listener as she slowly backed away down the pier with Fajro in her arms. As if on cue, the crowd immediately rushed into the water as Pomri and the woman subdued soldiers who were trying to hold people back with the aid of a few from the crowd who stayed behind. Three explosions cracked the air and two mamen on the beach fell to the ground, blood and water quickly filling their clothes. A man quickly came to their aid as the rest continued fighting.

Behind her, thunderous horns filled the air as an armada of war boats filled to the brim with glowing blue paddlers appeared from the mist and cut through the water toward the outer line of the blockade. They tossed hooks and ropes onto the boats and poured themselves into the furthest ships of the blockade, taking them with ease. A handful of Holragi soldiers on the coast rushed to their submersibles, returning to protect the bigger ship.

"You've doomed them all," Fajro spoke roughly as she pulled him down the pier. "We could have had something great." Fifty soldiers, all with hand muskets, pointed them at Melna, waiting for a clear shot.

"We still can," she said, finally relieved of her duties. "But not like this."

She could feel the burn on her skin turning raw and opening up to the blood that had gathered underneath. She winced with each step backward, but pushed it out of her mind.

"Someday, our successors will do what we couldn't. They will learn to temper their differences. They will understand and overcome the obscura. They will be better than we could be."

"They will all die," said Fajro. "You heard Liffa... it is... immovable... impenetrable."

"Some people think they can outrun their problems, only to find that they always catches up. The wise try to outlast it. And they never really succeed, do they? The problem becomes a part of who they are."

"You... know a way?"

"My, how the tables have turned," she smiled, acknowledging how bittersweet this end had become.

"Tell me!" he begged, "I'll bring Liffa back! I'll disperse the blockade! W-Whatever you want."

"No," She responded without pause, "You have forsaken your confidence, and sullied the name of fidelant. Your secrets end here."

"Wait!"

In a sudden move he pushed her knife away and twisted out of her chokehold, narrowly missing the blade, and tumbled toward the edge of the pier. Melna saw she had become vulnerable, so she ran toward Fajro amidst the gunfire and jumped off the pier, catching his leg on the way down to pull him under the water with her. The water froze and the salt stung against her newly-opened burns and she screamed out in pain as they fell deeper, but still she held on to Fajro's leg as he kicked against her to surface. She felt a tightness in her side, and then a pain that leaked the warmth out of her body into the water. It didn't matter anymore. She had to finish what she had surrendered herself for. She looked around for Fajro above her and tugged hard on his leg, sending him flailing downard and her up to meet him. Her grip released from his leg and took his arm instead, holding it true and letting her other hand lay the blade to rest upon his neck. It was done.

The soldiers were recovering his body when she last saw his lifeless face staring back at her between the volley of light rays wedging their way between the rafters. In the shallows beneath the pier, not fifty paces away, she lay beneath the sand, clinging to the bullet wound in her side and looking out toward the water. Upon the waves, not too far off, the blue lights of the Guardians of Ulukoma darted with urgency in their new found vessels, fetching children and elders and adults, one after the other, from the icy clutches of the water. And the forward ram of Shinna's ship shone brightly as it barreled through the few ships still committed to the blockade.

Just before she drifted off, she whispered a silent benediction to the people she had never met who shed their fears and risked their lives to save a people they did not know. She felt Kipnu's warm presence wrap around her as her last thought transpired into the wind, speaking to Liffa under the Ziyu tree.
