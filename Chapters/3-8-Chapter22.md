# Chapter 22

*Plink... Plink.*

The door above Melna dripped directly onto her head on the short ride to Heiko in a cramped submarine. Her mind was wandering upon that woman's path. Jumping off of Shinna's boat. Swimming through the kind of cold most Pangum would certainly perish in. She wondered if she made it to shore or if the water turned her spirit into a wave. She deserved to be a tall one, sweeping fishers and kelpers off their feet when they weren't paying attention. They would know her well when she came around. They would listen to her when she was speaking.

Perhaps she was there with her, in the drops of ocean from the broken door of that small submarine. Or perhaps she survived, far away from the water. A whole life waiting for her in the light. One more fulfilling than the suffering she knew so well.

"When we land, we head straight to the conduit and then the station," said Fajro, repeating himself. "I'll speak first."

"If I didn't know any better, I'd say you're nervous."

"You don't. And I'm not."


<!-- Melna gives a speech. Commands them to run. -->
<!-- People run, some die, some are captured, most make it to the fog -->
<!-- Melna dies? Gets a mortal wound, ambiguous if death or not. -->
<!-- Heiko explodes, empty -->
