## Chapter 23

"Liffa!"

I stood in the darkness and the deafening snow, leaning against a Ziyu that stood watch above the reconstruction of the Great Pavilion. My hand perched firmly over the lever that connected me to hae, sure of its urgency.

"Liffa!" I screamed hysterically into the microphone, but I knew that thi couldn't hear me across such a distance. Holrag had undoubtedly given up on hae, but I wouldn't.

Setre came to me and put a hand on my shoulder, but I was stubborn, shrugged her hand off, and pressed the button, "Liffa, please pick up if you can hear this."

The silence grew but my hand ignored it. Setre said, "That's enough. They'll find us here if you keep that up."

"So let them! We can fight!" I responded.

"You have much to learn, Linyu. Now, stop this nonsense and come sit with the others."

"Why are we just sitting here?!"

She looked at me in a way she reserved for no one else. As if to remind me that she was still my nather, that a good kaln would not take the patience of hae nather for granted.

She tried persuasion. "Lin. What did your mother teach you to do with a problem?"

"Solve it."

"Before that."

"...Understand it."

"And how do you understand a problem you've never seen before?"

I caught her meaning, albeit a little late, but she saw the value in this moment.

Her voice had calmed to a cajole, "By talking to the people around you. Now let's head back and start doing that."

Reluctantly, I nestled the microphone onto a bend in the branches and looked out into the crowd of Heikoans and Ulukomans. They were huddled around small fires dotting wide stone basin where the eternal flame used to dance. A few adults were treating the wounded near a larger fire, making use of its bright light and sanitizing heat. Their spirit reminded me of Kipnu. When I woke from death that night on the beach of Ulukoma and the first thing I saw was his face and the unwavering concern for life.

These were truly strangers in this place. They were displaced and came to us out of necessity. And yet the looks on their faces told me that they still felt uncomfortable around a people they were taught to distrust.

"Setre, we need to talk," said Pomri, approaching. I kept my position behind my nather, so as to avoid being a distraction, but I listened closely at what they had to say.

"Pomri," she spoke her name with pity, empathizing about Melna's loss. But Pomri was focused on her people.

"Heiko has just been wiped away. Half of our people have been captured or killed. Why are we just sitting here?", Pomri asked, incredulous, "We should go back. Look for survivors, recover what's left of our homeland."

She heard Pomri, and wanted to believe her, but she knew the power of the weapon that had been used on Heiko. How unlikely it would have been that anything recognizable would remain. But she couldn't say that to Pomri as much as she wanted to.

"No. It's too dangerous. The Holragi may have returned."

"Why would they do that? They've already finished with us. What could they possibly still want with Heiko now?"

"They will not stop. Not until everyone is under their thumb."

"Then let us prick the thumb with sword and spear," she said with nearly a smile, "until there is no more blood to spill."

Setre let out a sigh, seeing that she wouldn't be able to convince her that easily.

"Look," Pomri said, "Maybe it's not high on your list of priorities right now, but this is for closure. We need to be able to say that we did all we could in the aftermath."

"You already know what I'm going to say."

Pomri cursed the wind and turned away, looking at nothing in particular.

Melna tried persuasion, "Let's give our people some rest for a time. "They've been through a lot."

"Do you think any of us can rest at a time like this? Every idle moment could be a life saved from the rubbleâ€“"

"Or a life lost chasing the dead."

"If even one is alive, it will have been worth it."

They stared at each other intensely, knowing they were not likely to reach an agreement. But Setre had authority with the shipkeepers of Ulukoma, and she would never send them on a suicide mission.

Setre spoke with gravity, as if to lay a blanket upon the conversation, "We're staying here."

Pomri leaned back without breaking eye contact and looked at Setre sardonically.

"I understand," she said coldly. And without hesitation, she walked away and sat back down with a group that had kept space for her beside a fire. I jolted forward to walk with her, but my nather held me back, saying "Don't follow her, Linyu. Her judgment is clouded by anger." But I knew Pomri, had seen her act and heard her think. I knew that her judgment was not clouded, but could do nothing to change my nather's mind.

"Linyu, I need your help," she stooped down and held my head a bit. "Sit on that branch while I speak to the group and watch how people react to what I say."

I nodded in approval, taking up post in my usualy crevasse during talks. She stood upon the lip of the basin and took my hand into hers. The crowd, thousands strong, spared no time in quieting down to listen to what she had to say.

"Alright everyone, it's time we explained to you what's happening."

Her voice was strong, but carried the slightest hint of quiver. Unnoticeable to the crowd, but obvious to anyone who knew her well. *She still doesn't see herself as a leader.*

"You are currently sitting upon the grounds of the Great Pavilion of Ulukoma. You've been brought here by those who call this place home. Not as slaves, but as refugees."

Her eyes darted across the area in an awkward silence, trying to think of what to say.

"I probably don't need to tell you that everything you knew is likely gone. This was not an accident. A man named Fajro has been consolidating the world's navies and engineers. And this was their first move: a coordinated assault by sky and by land meant to force your people into submitting to slavery. Consider yourselves lucky to have a leader as clever and selfless as Melna."

My eyes found Pomri's and peered into them. The fire before her cast glintlights off the water forming on her eyes. Her expression fell into that constellation, fervid and tenacious, taking Setre's words and purifying them in the blinding rage within her.

"This is not the first time the engineers of Holrag have waged war in the name of ambition. Many tribes of Holrag faced the same decision many Ka'to ago. Those who resisted-"

Her voice broke a little but she maintained herself. I squeezed her hand a little harder and she squeezed back.

She cleared her throat, and spoke again. "Ulukoma is a place of rebirth, renewal. You can live out the rest of your days here, fishing, kelping, rebuilding, leaving a legacy to the survivors of the obscura. But to get to that point, we need to take things a day at a time. Right now, we need to figure out how to feed everyone and rebuild shelter from the snow."

She pointed to a group of Ulukomans near her, focusing on a man and a maman, both of them fit enough to hold .

"Kinsho will lead the fishers. Senri, the kelpers. If you are a constructor, come to me."

Kinsho and Senri nodded together in affirmation.

"Okay. Let's not waste any time then. Go!"

"Fishers!" Kinsho called out with a booming voice, and hundreds rose to meet him.

"Kelpers with me! Kelpers!" called Senri with a higher pitch, but just as loud. They walked in opposite directions, drawing eager people away from their grief, their paralysis, leaving only the doctors and the infirm. Pomri and a few from her group stayed with the doctors, helping wherever she could.

My nather's hand led me along toward the snow-covered pillars that would soon be the entrance of the new pavilion. Only a handful of Heikoans had joined her group of Ulukoman builders. I assumed that the rest must have stayed in Heiko, protecting the city they had built. My mind wandered to Melna, seeing her and Fajro fall into the water. Of my nather keeping her ship a safe distance away while Pomri fought off solider after soldier on the shoreline, trying to get to Melna, but being pushed into the water instead.

"This is all we have?" she asked the group.

"Yes ma'am," said a maman. Thi had shell-shocked eyes and was shivering slightly in the cold. "The engineers are bound to protect the city. We are just apprentices."

Melna looked frustrated. *What a ridiculous law*, she could have thought.

"Very well. What do you know how to do?"

"We can quarter saw. Salt seal."

"Trussing? Joints? Crane Pulleys?"

All in the group hesitated, and Melna grew more frustrated. This was basic work in Holrag, they should know this by now.

"Okay. Come with me."

She led them for a few steps to two trusses that had been placed before they had heard news of Heiko, and I saw them off before joining the doctors around the large fire. I know my nather saw me. She always saw me.

Pomri was crouched over an unconscious maman laying on a makeshift bed of salted kelp and preparing to inject kanosin into hae neck near the spinal column. She was visibly  hesitant but an older Ulukoman maman assured her that the drug would work.

"Setre's kaln, I reckon," she greeted me as I approached. "I'm Fanla."

"You know what you're doing."

"A good man taught me for only a short while, but I've had a lot of practice over the past few days."

"Kipnu," I responded.

"Y-Yes," she was surprised.

Her eyes looked closer at me for some sort of answer, and saw my eager face.

"Would you like to help?"

I nodded.

She shifted herself without standing, making way for me to crouch beside her. She took my hand and held it steady against the back of the maman.

"Hold hae body like this so I can make the injection. Steady now."

The needle was as thick as the wires I used for listeners, but the tip was precisely machined and oxidized blue. Shaki titanium working, if I'd ever seen it. She placed it at the base of the maman's neck, angling it to inject toward hae head, and I watched as the glowing blue liquid disappeared into the body of the maman. With a final push, her hand finished and then gently extracted the needle. Some small remnants of the kanosin were pushed into hae hydroderm where they spread across it like a flow tattoo. Instinctively, I spat onto my thumb and pressed it hard against the wound to stop the bleeding. Pomri stared in disbelief.

"You've... done this before?"

"Yes," I said coldly. Pomri understood my tone.

I gently laid the maman back down and took up the syringe for rinsing and sanitation near the fire. Pomri followed me as I moved.

"What is this drug we're giving them?"

"Kanosin," I said, slowly rinsing the syringe in a basin of ocean water. I pulled the plunger out to fill it and pushed it again to empty.

"Why are you using a narcotic on injuries and hypoxia?"

"Because it works."

"Yes, but how?" she implored.

"I stopped the rinsing and walked a few paces to fetch a long monobodied forcep. I placed the syringe into the end and immersed it into the fire. I didn't speak. My mother had taught me to be discerning about who I told; only those those who would use the knowledge well and accept its impossible truth deserved to know. Pomri would only accept what she saw herself.

"I don't know," I said. A practiced lie, but a good one.

I removed the syringe from the fire and looked closely at the tip. A film of char covered it, showing that it had been sanitized. I searched for the basket of syringes I had seen before and spotted it near to an old guardian of Lissa's who was tending to a famished skeleton of a throngia. But before I could move, Pomri took up my free hand and wrapped her own around it.

"Come to Heiko with me," she pleaded under her breath. Her eyes had a fire to them I hadn't seen before: determined and brazen.

I glowered at her, at the ease with which she went behind my nather's back. But she saw that I was old enough to have my own thoughts, knew that I needed closure just as much as she did: a closure that Setre could not be persuaded to allow.

"Mid-day's nap. Find me on the beach where we landed."

*Why did I say that?!*, I thought. But I didn't stop myself. I wasn't bound by regret, only worry for my nather. She nodded back with that same intensity.

Pomri returned to the maman she was monitoring to take hae vitals and ensure thi was warm. With a quick twist, I secured a cover onto the syringe and placed it in the basket with the others, giving a nod to the old guardian. A deep sense of guilt overshadowed my thoughts and drew my eyes toward the pavilion. Impatiently, she darted here and there like a tilmarim in the dark, teaching people how to construct a truss from tarred wooden posts. For the moment I let her fire into me, felt it cleanse the guilt from my heart. Our divergence was inevitable, but I remembered that we had the same goal: to outlast the obscura.
