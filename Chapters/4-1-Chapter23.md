## Chapter 23

"So that's how it happened?"

"I did what I had to"

My nather and I sat in the darkness and the deafening snow, leaning against a Ziyu that stood watch above the reconstruction of the Great Pavilion of Ulukoma. This was the place where she said she found me, unconscious, smoke covering my face.

"And mom?"

Setre sighed and looked down.

"You promised to save hae. Where were you?"

"I had to save you first, Lin. It was–"

"You. Promised." I glared at her, my face much closer to hers than I remember from standing under her before Lissa.

She tried to put a hand on my shoulder, but I was stubborn, shrugged her hand off.

"Linyu, I did what I could. The fire... surprised everyone. We were already engaged by the time-"

"Fuck the fire," I growled and stood up. "My mother was willing to die to restore justice to Ulukoma. But you promised me you would never let it come to that. A promise means 'no matter what'."

"Linyu," she called to me as I stormed behind the ziyu, "stop this nonsense."

I turned and screamed at her, "Everyone I love has died! How can you call my feelings nonsense? Have some fucking empathy!"

She looked at me, speechless, in a sort of way she reserved for no one else. As if to remind me that she was still my nather, that a good kaln would not take her patience for granted. But we both knew the truth. She was my nather, but my mother raised me alone.

I raised the microphone on the ziyu and spoke.

"Liffa. I don't know if you can hear this. I want you to know, that everything is quickly turning to chaos down here. But you are not forgotten. I'm trying to figure out where you'll land so I can get to you. If you can hear this... please send some sort of signal."

The silence and static in my listener grew but my finger lingered on the speaking lever, waiting for a moment of hope. It didn't come.

"That's enough," Setre said. "They'll find us here if you keep that up."

"So let them! We can fight!" I responded. "What good is sitting?!"

She looked at me in a way she reserved for no one else. As if to remind me that she was still my nather, that a good kaln would not take the patience of hae nather for granted.

"Lin. What did your mother teach you to do with a problem?"

"Don't talk to me about my mother."

She paused and looked to the side, softened her voice. "She meant a lot to more than just you, you know."

Still I couldn't look her in the eye, but I felt a small pang of guilt.

"Solve it," I answered her.

"Before that."

"...Understand it."

"And how do you understand a problem you've never seen before?"

I caught her meaning, but late.

Her voice had calmed to a cajole, "By talking to the people around you. We'll never get anywhere fighting, so let's look ahead and try our best."

"You're just looking to shirk your responsibilities. Be honest, you didn't grieve when thi died."

She raised her voice again, "I can't afford to grieve!" It was broken, and it was hurt, and I regretted what I had just said. 

With a loud thud of her spear against the ground, she lifted herself and stormed off toward the crowd, leaving me to my own thoughts. I looked out into the crowd of Heikoi and Ulukomai. They were huddled around small fires dotting wide stone basin where the eternal flame used to dance. A few adults were treating the wounded near a larger fire, making use of its bright light and sanitizing heat. Their spirit reminded me of Kipnu. When I woke from death that night on the beach of Ulukoma and the first thing I saw was his face and the unwavering concern for life. These were truly strangers in this place. They were displaced and came to us out of necessity. And yet the looks on their faces told me that they still felt uncomfortable around a people they were taught to distrust.

"Setre, we need to talk," said Pomri, approaching her. I kept my position by the tree and listened closely.

"Pomri," she spoke her name with a solemn pity, empathizing about Melna's loss, trying to keep her voice from breaking again. But Pomri was focused on her people.

"Heiko has just been wiped away. Half of our people have been captured or killed. Why are we just sitting here?", Pomri asked, incredulous, "We should go back. Look for survivors, recover what's left of our homeland."

She heard Pomri, and wanted to believe her, but she knew the power of the weapon that had been used on Heiko. How unlikely it would have been that anything recognizable would remain. But she couldn't say that to Pomri as much as she wanted to.

"No. It's too dangerous. The Holragi may have returned."

"Why would they do that? They've already finished with us. What could they possibly still want with Heiko now?"

"They will not stop. Not until everyone is under their thumb."

"Then let us prick the thumb," she said, "'til there is no more blood to spill."

Setre let out a sigh, seeing that she wouldn't be able to convince her that easily.

"Setre," Pomri said, "This is for closure. We need to be able to say that we did all we could in the aftermath."

"You already know what I'm going to say."

Pomri cursed the wind and turned away, looking at nothing in particular.

Melna tried to persuade her, "Let's give our people some rest for a time. "They've been through a lot."

"Do you think any of us can rest at a time like this? Every idle moment could be a life saved from the rubble–"

"Or a life lost chasing the dead."

"If even one is alive, it will have been worth it."

They stared at each other intensely, knowing they were not likely to reach an agreement. But Setre had authority with the shipkeepers of Ulukoma, and she would never send them on a suicide mission.

Setre spoke with gravity, as if to lay a blanket upon the conversation, "We're staying here."

Pomri leaned back without breaking eye contact and gave Setre a sardonic look.

"I understand," she said coldly. And without hesitation, she walked away and sat back down with a group that had kept space for her beside a fire. I jolted forward to walk with her, but my nather held me back, saying "Don't follow her, Linyu. Her judgment is clouded by anger." But I knew Pomri, had seen her act and heard her think. I knew that her judgment was not clouded, but could do nothing to change my nather's mind.

Setre moved to stand upon the lip of the fire basin and took a blazing branch from the largest fire. The crowd, thousands strong, spared no time in quieting down to listen to what she had to say.

"Alright everyone, it's time we explained to you what's happening."

Her voice was strong, but carried the slightest hint of quiver. Unnoticeable to the crowd, but obvious to anyone who knew her well. _She still doesn't see herself as a leader._

"You are currently sitting upon the grounds of the Great Pavilion of Ulukoma. You've been brought here by those who call this place home. Not as slaves, but as refugees."

Her eyes darted across the area in an awkward silence, trying to think of what to say.

"I probably don't need to tell you that everything you knew is likely gone. This was not an accident. A man named Fajro has been consolidating the world's sccientists and engineers. And this was their first move: a coordinated assault by sky and by land meant to force your people into submitting to slavery. Consider yourselves lucky to have a leader as clever and selfless as Melna."

My eyes found Pomri's and peered into them. The fire before her cast glintlights off the water forming on her eyes. Her expression fell into that constellation, fervid and tenacious, taking Setre's words and purifying them in the blinding rage within her.

"This is not the first time the engineers of Holrag have waged war in the name of ambition. Many tribes of Holrag faced the same decision many Ka'to ago. Those who resisted-"

Her voice broke a little but she maintained herself. I squeezed her hand a little harder and she squeezed back.

She cleared her throat, and spoke again. "Ulukoma is a place of rebirth, renewal. You can live out the rest of your days here, fishing, kelping, rebuilding, leaving a legacy to the survivors of the obscura. But to get to that point, we need to take things a day at a time. Right now, we need to figure out how to feed everyone and rebuild shelter from the snow."

She pointed to a group of Ulukomai near her, focusing on a man and a maman, both of them fit enough to carry an entire tree between them.

"Kinsho will lead the fishers. Senri, the kelpers. Fanla will continue with the medical team. Rev'i and the other guardians, resume your patrols. If you are a constructor, come to me."

Kinsho and Senri nodded together in affirmation.

"Okay. Let's not waste any time then. Go!"

"Fishers!" Kinsho called out with a booming voice, and hundreds rose to meet him.

"Kelpers with me! Kelpers!" called Senri with a higher pitch, but just as loud. They walked in opposite directions, drawing eager people away from their grief, their paralysis, leaving only the doctors and the infirm. Pomri and a few from her group stayed with the doctors, helping wherever she could.

My nather's hand led me along toward the snow-covered pillars that would soon be the entrance of the new pavilion. Only a handful of Heikoi had joined her group of Ulukomai builders. I assumed that the rest must have stayed in Heiko, protecting the city they had built. My mind wandered to Melna, seeing her and Fajro fall into the water. Of my nather keeping her ship a safe distance away while Pomri fought off solider after soldier on the shoreline, trying to get to Melna, but being pushed into the water instead.

"This is all we have?" she asked the group.

"Yes ma'am," said a maman. Thi had shell-shocked eyes and was shivering slightly in the cold. "The engineers are bound to protect the city. We are just apprentices."

Melna looked frustrated. _What a ridiculous law_, she could have thought.

"Very well. What do you know how to do?"

"We can quarter saw. Salt seal."

"Trussing? Joints? Crane Pulleys?"

All in the group hesitated, and Melna grew more frustrated. This was basic work in Holrag, they should know this by now.

"Okay. Come with me."

She led them for a few steps to two trusses that had been placed before they had heard news of Heiko, and I saw them off before joining the doctors around the large fire. I know my nather saw me. She always saw me.

Pomri was crouched over an unconscious maman laying on a makeshift bed of salted kelp and preparing to inject kanosin into hae neck near the spinal column. She was visibly hesitant but an older Ulukomai woman assured her that the drug would work.

"You know what you're doing," I said to the older woman, observing her movements.

"Kipnu taught me for only a moment, but I've had a lot of practice over the past few days."

Her eyes looked closer at me for some sort of answer, and saw my eager face.

"Would you like to help?"

I nodded.

She shifted herself without standing, making way for me to crouch beside her. She took my hand and held it steady against the back of the maman.

"Hold hae body like this so I can make the injection. Steady now."

The needle was as thick as the wires I used for listeners, but the tip was precisely machined and oxidized blue. Shaki titanium working. She placed it at the base of the maman's neck, angling it to inject toward hae head, and I watched as the blue liquid disappeared into the body of the maman. With a final push, her hand finished and then gently extracted the needle. Some small remnants of kanosin were pushed into hae hydroderm where they glowed and spread across it like a flow tattoo. Instinctively, I spat onto my thumb and pressed it hard against the wound to stop the bleeding. Pomri stared in disbelief.

"You've... done this before?"

"Yes," I said coldly. Pomri understood my tone.

I gently laid the maman back down and took up the syringe for rinsing and sanitation near the fire. Pomri followed me as I moved.

"What is this drug we're giving them?"

"Kanosin," I said, slowly rinsing the syringe in a basin of ocean water. I pulled the plunger out to fill it and pushed it again to empty.

"The narcotic? Why are you using Kanosin on injuries and hypoxia?"

"Because it works."

She gaped, both astonished and deeply horrified. I stopped the rinsing and walked a few paces to fetch a long monobodied forcep, placing the syringe into the end and immersing it into the fire. I didn't speak. My mother had taught me to be discerning about who I told about Kanosin; only those those who would use the knowledge well and accept its truth deserved to know. Pomri would barely accept what she saw herself.

"How does it work?" she implored.

"I don't know," I said. A practiced lie, but a good one.

I removed the syringe from the fire and looked closely at the tip. A film of char covered it, showing that it had been sanitized. I searched for the basket of syringes I had seen before and spotted it near to an old guardian of Lissa's who was tending to a famished skeleton of a throngia. But before I could move, Pomri took up my free hand and wrapped her own around it.

"Come to Heiko with me," she pleaded under her breath. Her eyes had a fire to them I hadn't seen before: determined and brazen.

I glowered at her, at the ease with which she went behind my nather's back. But she saw that I was old enough to have my own thoughts, knew that I needed closure just as much as she did: a closure that Setre could not be persuaded to allow.

"Mid-day's nap. Find me on the beach where we landed."

_Why did I say that?!_, I thought. But I didn't stop myself. I wasn't bound by regret, only worry for my nather. She nodded back with that same intensity.

Pomri returned to the maman she was monitoring to take hae vitals and ensure thi was warm. With a quick twist, I secured a cover onto the syringe and placed it in the basket with the others, giving a nod to the old guardian. A deep sense of guilt overshadowed my thoughts and drew my eyes toward the pavilion. Impatiently, she darted here and there like a tilmarim in the dark, teaching people how to construct a truss from tarred wooden posts. For the moment I let her fire into me, felt it cleanse the guilt from my heart. Our divergence was inevitable, but I remembered that we had the same goal: to outlast the obscura.
