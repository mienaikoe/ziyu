## Chapter 23

"Liffa!"

I stood in the darkness with the snow falling on a Ziyu that rose tall above the ongoing reconstruction of the Great Pavilion. My hand perched firmly over the lever that connected me to hae, sure of it

"Liffa!" I screamed hysterically into the microphone, but I knew that thi could not hear me across such a distance. Holragi had undoubtedly given up on hae, but I couldn't do that.

Setre came to me and put a hand on my shoulder, but I was stubborn, shrugged her hand off, and pressed the button, "Liffa, please pick up if you can hear this."

The silence grew but my hand ignored it. Setre said, "That's enough. They'll find us here if you keep that up."

"So let them! We're ready to fight!"

"You have much to learn, Linyu. Now, stop this nonsense and come sit with the others."

"Why are we just sitting here?!"

She looked at me in a way she reserved for no one else. As if to remind me that she was still my nather, that a good kaln would not take the patience of hae nather for granted.

She tried persuasion. "Lin. What did your mother teach you to do with a problem?"

"Solve it."

"Before that."

"...Understand it."

"And how do you understand a problem you've never seen before?"

I caught her meaning, albeit a little late, but she saw the value in this moment.

Her voice had calmed to a cajole, "By talking to the people around you. Now let's head back and start doing that."

Reluctantly, I nestled the microphone onto a bend in the branches and looked out into the crowd of Heikoans and Ulukomans huddled around small fires dotting the dark stone stage where the eternal flame used to fill our bellies and move our hearts. These were truly strangers in this place. They were displaced and came to us out of necessity. And yet the looks on their faces told me that they felt uncomfortable around a people they were taught to distrust.

"Alright everyone, it's time we explained to you what's happening."

Her voice was strong, but carried just a quiver of unese. Unnoticeable to the crowd, but obvious to me. *She still doesn't see herself a leader*.

"You are currently sitting upon the grounds of the Great Pavilion of Ulukoma. You've been brought here by us who call this place home. Not as slaves, but as refugees."
