## Chapter 23

"Liffa!"

I stood in the darkness and the deafening snow, leaning against a Ziyu that stood watch above the ongoing reconstruction of the Great Pavilion. My hand perched firmly over the lever that connected me to hae, sure of its urgency.

"Liffa!" I screamed hysterically into the microphone, but I knew that thi could not hear me across such a distance. Holrag had undoubtedly given up on hae, but I couldn't do that.

Setre came to me and put a hand on my shoulder, but I was stubborn, shrugged her hand off, and pressed the button, "Liffa, please pick up if you can hear this."

The silence grew but my hand ignored it. Setre said, "That's enough. They'll find us here if you keep that up."

"So let them! We can fight!" I responded.

"You have much to learn, Linyu. Now, stop this nonsense and come sit with the others."

"Why are we just sitting here?!"

She looked at me in a way she reserved for no one else. As if to remind me that she was still my nather, that a good kaln would not take the patience of hae nather for granted.

She tried persuasion. "Lin. What did your mother teach you to do with a problem?"

"Solve it."

"Before that."

"...Understand it."

"And how do you understand a problem you've never seen before?"

I caught her meaning, albeit a little late, but she saw the value in this moment.

Her voice had calmed to a cajole, "By talking to the people around you. Now let's head back and start doing that."

Reluctantly, I nestled the microphone onto a bend in the branches and looked out into the crowd of Heikoans and Ulukomans huddled around small fires dotting the ground surrounding the wide stone basin where the eternal flame used to dance. A few adults were treating the wounded near a larger fire on the basin, making use of its bright light and sanitizing heat. Their spirit reminded me of Kipnu. When I woke up and the first thing I saw was a look of concern on his face.

These were truly strangers in this place. They were displaced and came to us out of necessity. And yet the looks on their faces told me that they still felt uncomfortable around a people they were taught to distrust.

"Setre, we need to talk," said Pomri, approaching. I kept my position behind my nather, so as to avoid being a distraction, but I listened closely at what they had to say.

"Pomri," she spoke her name with pity, empathizing about Melna's loss. But Pomri was focused on her people.

"Heiko has just been wiped away. Half of our people have been captured or killed. Why are we just sitting here?", Pomri asked, incredulous, "We should go back. Look for survivors, recover what's left of our homeland."

She heard Pomri, and wanted to believe her, but she knew the power of the weapon that had been used on Heiko. How unlikely it would have been that anything recognizable would remain. But she couldn't say that to Pomri as much as she wanted to.

"No. It's too dangerous. The Holragi may have returned."

"Why would they do that? They've already finished with us. What could they possibly still want with Heiko now?"

"They will not stop, Pomri. Not until everyone is under their thumb."

"Then let us prick the thumb until there is no more blood to spill."

Setre let out a sigh, seeing that she wouldn't be able to convince her that easily.

"Look," Pomri said, "Maybe it's not high on your list of priorities right now, but this is for closure. We need to be able to say that we did all we could in the aftermath."

"You already know what I'm going to say."

Pomri cursed the wind and turned away, looking at nothing in particular.

Melna tried persuasion, "Let's give our people some rest for a time. "They've been through a lot."

"Do you think any of us can rest at a time like this? Every idle moment could be a life saved from the rubbleâ€“"

"Or a life lost chasing the dead."

"I would be honored to give my life for one of my countrymen."

They stared at each other intensely, knowing they were not likely to reach an agreement. But Setre had control of the ships of Ulukoma, and there was no way she was lending one for a suicide mission.

"We. Stay. Here. Understand?"

Pomri leaned back without breaking eye contact and looked at Setre sardonically.

"Yea. I get it," she said without warmth. And without hesitation, she walked away and sat back down with a group that had kept space for her beside a fire. I jolted to walk with her, but my nather held me back, saying "Don't follow her, Linyu. Her judgment is clouded by anger." But I knew Pomri, had seen her act and heard her think. I knew that her judgment was not clouded, but could do nothing to change my nather's mind.

"Linyu, I need your help," she stooped down and held my head a bit. "Sit on that branch while I speak to the group and watch how people react to what I say."

I nodded in approval, taking up post in my usualy crevasse during talks. She stood upon the lip of the basin and took my hand into hers. The crowd, thousands strong, spared no time in quieting down to listen to what she had to say.

"Alright everyone, it's time we explained to you what's happening."

Her voice was strong, but carried the slightest hint of quiver. Unnoticeable to the crowd, but obvious to anyone who knew her well. *She still doesn't see herself as a leader.*

"You are currently sitting upon the grounds of the Great Pavilion of Ulukoma. You've been brought here by those who call this place home. Not as slaves, but as refugees."

Her eyes darted across the area in an awkward silence, trying to think of what to say.

"I probably don't need to tell you that everything you knew is likely gone. This was not an accident. A man named Fajro has been consolidating the world's navies and engineers. And this was their first move: a coordinated assault by sky and by land meant to force your people into submitting to slavery. Consider yourselves lucky to have a leader as clever and selfless as Melna."

My eyes found Pomri standing near a tree. I peered into her eyes and I could see the fires casting glintlights off the water forming on her eyes. Her expression fell into that constellation, fervid and tenacious, taking Setre's words and purifying them in the blinding light raging within her.

"This is not the first time the engineers of Holrag have waged war in the name of ambition. Many tribes of Holrag faced the same decision many Ka'to ago. Those who resisted-"

Her voice broke a little but she maintained herself. I squeezed her hand a little harder and she squeezed back.

She cleared her throat, and spoke again. "Ulukoma is a place of rebirth, renewal. You can live out the rest of your days here, fishing, kelping, rebuilding, leaving a legacy to the survivors of the obscura. But to get to that point, we need to take it a day at a time. Right now, we need to figure out how to feed everyone."

She pointed to a group of Ulukomans near her, focusing on a man and a maman.

"Kinsho and Senri, could you assemble two crews for this?"

They nodded in affirmation.

"Okay. Let's not waste any time then. Go!"

"Fishers, over here! Fishers!" Kinsho called out as he moved just outside of the circle of fires.

"Kelpers!," called Senri, walking in the opposite direction.

The people matriculated on their own, eager to do something other than sulking in that paralysis stage of grief.

*This would be an excellent time to find Pomri.*

<!-- Linyu gets this idea planted in hae head, and sneaks away with Pomri to go back -->
