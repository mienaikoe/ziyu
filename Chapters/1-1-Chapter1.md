## Chapter 1

_It's quiet. Something is wrong._

_No. It's fine. Just a little late._

_It's never this late._

Ara had lifted from the horizon and begun warming the land. The breeze that it lifted filled my lungs with breath, and my head with worry. But still the tree remained silent. I took a deep breath and examined its bark and branches and leaves, but nothing looked different: it was still the same tree I remembered my mother taking me to.

_It must be the wind. It's too dry right now._

Patiently, I waited for an answer that would settle my mind, some glimpse of a sound I hadn't been listening to close enough. For I moment I thought I could hear my mother's words echoing through through the branches.

"The wind speaks," thi would say. "And the ziyu tells us all its secrets."

"What is it saying?" I must have asked hae a hundred times. My mother would tell me to listen a little closer, that the answer was not something I could hear. I knew that even the silence was a sort of answer, but the trouble was in the question. With an unsettled feeling I stood up and dusted off my trousers, still staring at Ara holding its station through the quiet leaves, and I wondered what trouble might be brewing there.

<!-- human voice -->

"Lovely morning, Liffa."

Startled, I turned around to see my bundwoman, Melna, standing in the light, her hair dancing in time with the leaves.

"How long have you been here?" I asked.

"Just a moment. I figured you would be here when I didn't see you in the cellar."

I stayed silent, still listening for the leaves and my mother's voice.

"You've been gone a while. Breakfast will be ready soon."

"I'll be there in a bit."

She stared at me for a moment, I assume to size up my strange behavior.

"There's a chill in the air," she remarked, "Come in for a bit, and let the breeze settle."

"I'll be right there," I told her, and she gave me a nod before heading back.

My bundman, Kipnu, was standing over the stove, wearing nothing more than his house shorts and a tired face. He looked up and cast a placid smile across his face - the kind that reminded me why I loved him. I walked up to hug and nuzzle him good morning. Melna was squatting at a table in the great room, reading her daily missive.

"Anything new?", I asked her.

"Not particularly. We're still running our typical surplus of fruits. People always request more than they actually need."

Kipnu chortled, looking at me. "Liffa could probably eat the entire surplus by haeself."

"Shame will never keep me from my one true love," I replied with a smile. "Anyway, all the farmers that I know feed their surplus to the saffas."

"I'll pretend I didn't hear that," said Melna.

I stirred at the table, and then rose again to go bother Kipnu who had fallen asleep at the stove. With a gentle nudge, I moved him away and removed the pot from the heat.

"A leaf would be great," I told him as I fetched a spoon.

Melna walked over to us to check on the food. "Let me make sure it's still like my mother used to make," she took out a spoon and dipped it into the pot. "Too thick - add some water"

I pulled some water from the dew column at the center of the great room and returned to add it to the mix little by little, waiting for Melna's approval.

Finally, we sat down to eat.

A moment of quiet went by and I could see Melna's mind had moved onto a deeper thought. She released her pen and sat up in her chair, staring longingly out at the door. I could tell she was thinking about traveling again. The three of us had joined too early before we could roam across the world.

"It's been too long," she said with a longing tone.

Kipnu knew what she was thinking too. "Last time was when we went to the bay to live with the Hunnin for a week," he said. "I'll never forget how bored and hot I was. Who's idea was that again?" He never missed a chance to remind me.

"You're so ungrateful," I defended my choice, "You know we all had fun... doing..."

Melna and Kipnu both cracked a smirk as my voice trailed off, knowing what I really meant.

"There was nothing else to do but each other out there," Kipnu said.

"The fish!" I said. "We caught a fish that one time!"

"That was the fisherman," Melna reminded me.

"Yea, but we were all there to cheer him on," I said. "Anyway, I would gladly do it all again."

And I would. Because I was happy when they were around. It was the apart times, when the waves of loneliness washed upon the cracks of my heart. Those were the moments when I was keenly aware of how wholly inadequate I would always be.

I entered the dressing room as Melna was setting out her fidelant attire so I could help her tie the knots of her complex robes. I spoke not with my voice but with my the cold of my fingers.

She moved to the mirror and I followed her. The growing light of Ara had been shining through the window, and it bounced off the mirror and into my eyes as I walked toward it. I put my arm up to shield the light while she stood just barely in it.

She proceeded to wrap her cape around her shoulders and I took up the tying of her waistbelt behind her. The mauve color of Heiko shined proudly in the daylight. I remembered dying them in pohua, taking every care to ensure that the color was consistent and fast to the cloth, but still I saw all of its imperfections whenever I looked at it. Melna didn't seem to mind.

"This morning, you mentioned the cold air," I spoke hesitantly.

She didn't respond.

"The farmers have a responsibility, you know," I tried again to persuade her, "If a temperature drift is coming, we need to know so we aren't caught by an early-"

"Liffa... we've been over this. If I had evidence of drift, I would tell you."

She was a stone wall of secrets, and I, the climbing vine, would be unsatisfied until I had broken through. I knew that it was unfair for me to keep pushing when I knew she was bound to her duties, but I wasn't letting her go without a promise.

<!-- left off -->

I placed a hand on her bare shoulder, and pleaded, "Look me in the eye. Look at me and tell me you are not keeping secrets from your village. From your bundmaman."

She looked at me through the mirror for a moment, searching for motives in an innocent face.

"I don't have time for this," she said coldly.

I let out a frustrated sigh and fled to the doorway.

Before I could leave, she said, "Liffa..."

I stopped without turning.

"You know I love you."

I left.

Kipnu was going over his schedule of patients in the same spot we had left him. He looked up and took a glance at me, burying his head in the schedule again.

"Melna got you down?"

"How could you tell?"

"Ah you know."

I waited for him to elaborate or offer some advice, but he was too absorbed in the paper to respond. So I stooped at the table with him and a long awkward silence filled the room. Melna came downstairs and looked us over. She had a confused look for a brief moment, but resumed her departure.

"I'm headed to the train."

"Have a good day," he chimed. I stayed silent.

"I'll be back a bit late tonight," she said. "Don't wait up for me."

Late wasn't particularly rare for her, but I wanted to pry.

"Late? What for?" I asked.

"Yansha has been pushing us on this grain resolution."

I looked into her eyes more intently, looking for some hint of deception. She wasn't one to show such things but I knew her better than anyone else. Something was off. I stood up and approached her as she turned to leave the house.

"What are you doing?" She asked. I checked that her cords were tight and robe was creased correctly.

"Whatever it is you'll be arguing today," I said, "I'll be here when you return."

I embraced her as if she was going on a long journey. She was never too fond of touch, but today she raised her arms to reciprocate. "Thank you, Liffa."

Kipnu walked up to us, and she loosened up enough to hug the both of us before opening the door to the outside. He and I watched as she entered the daylight without looking back. Her assistant Pomri stood by with her saffa along the parkway, looking as palatial as always. The two of them together always gave me an uneasy feeling. _How strange for a maman to envy hae woman's assistant_.

"What's going on between you two?" Kipnu asked again.

I held my binding pendant tightly and remembered that marriage was full of difficulties.

"Nothing," I said. "Just a chill in the air."
