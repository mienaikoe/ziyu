## Chapter 1

_It's quiet._

_It's fine. Just a little late._

_It's never this late._

The golden disc of Ara had climbed the horizon when the breeze that it lifted filled my lungs with breath, and my head with worry. The tree that watched over me and my family for generations and sang to us every morning for generations remained silent. I took a deep breath and examined its teeming branches and dancing leaves, but nothing seemed amiss.

_It's the wind. It must be._

I waited patiently for an answer that would settle my mind, some glimpse of a sound that I hadn't been listening to. For I moment I thought I could hear my mother's words echoing through through the branches.

"The wind speaks," thi would say. "And the ziyu tells us all its secrets."

"What is it saying?" I must have asked hae a hundred times. My mother would tell me to listen closely, that the answer was sometimes not a sound, but a vision or a feeling. I knew that even the silence was a sort of answer, but the trouble was in the question. With an unsettled feeling I stood up and dusted off my trousers, still staring at Ara holding its station through the quiet leaves, its beams of light warming the pockets of water in my skin. I wondered if trouble might be brewing in that big ball of fire so far away.

"Lovely morning, isn't it?"

Startled, I turned around to see my bundwoman, Melna, standing in the light, her hair dancing in time with the leaves.

"How long have you been here?" I asked.

"Just a moment. I figured you would be here when I didn't see you in the cellar."

I stayed silent, still listening for the leaves and my mother's voice.

"You've been gone a while. Breakfast will be ready soon."

"I'll be there in a bit."

She stared at me for a moment, I assume to size up my strange behavior.

"There's a chill in the air," she remarked, "Come in for a bit, and let the breeze settle."

"I'll be right there," I told her, and she gave me a nod before heading back.

My bundman, Kipnu, was standing over the stove, wearing nothing more than his house shorts and a tired face. He looked up at me as I entere the room and cast a placid smile across his face - the kind that reminded me why I loved him. I walked up to hug and nuzzle him good morning. Melna was squatting at a table in the great room, reading her daily missive.

"Anything new?", I asked her.

"Not particularly. We're still running our typical surplus of fruits. People always request more than they actually need."

Kipnu chortled, looking at me. "Liffa could probably eat our entire surplus by haeself."

"Your shame will not keep me from my one true love," I replied with a smile. "Anyway, all the farmers that I know feed their surplus to the saffas."

"I'll pretend I didn't hear that," said Melna.

I stirred at the table, and then rose again to go bother Kipnu who had fallen asleep at the stove. With a gentle nudge, I moved him away and removed the pot from the heat.

"Let me make sure it's still like my mother used to make," I said as I took out a spoon of my own and dipped it into the pot. "Too thick - add some water."

Kipnu walked to the great room to pull some water from the dew column and returned to add it to the mix little by little, waiting for my approval. Finally, we sat down to eat.

A moment of quiet went by and I could see Melna's mind had moved onto a deeper thought. She released her pen and sat up in her chair, staring longingly out at the door.

"It's been a moment, hasn't it," she said with a wistful tone. "The three of us had joined too early before we could roam across the world."

"Last time we went somewhere was to the bay to live with the Hunnin for a week," said Kipnu. "I'll never forget how bored and hot I was. Who's idea was that again?" He never missed a chance to remind me.

"You're so ungrateful," I defended my choice, "You know we all had fun... doing..."

Melna and Kipnu both cracked a smirk as my voice trailed off, knowing what I really meant.

Kipnu groaned, "There was nothing else to do out there but–"

"The fish!" I yelled. "We caught a fish that one time!"

"That wasn't us," Melna reminded me.

"It was a group effort! We were all there to cheer on the fisherman," I said. "Anyway, it was beautiful there, and it loosened us up. I would gladly do it all again."

And I would. Because I was happy when they were around. It was the apart times, when the waves of loneliness washed over the cracks in my heart. Those were the moments when I was keenly aware of how wholly inadequate I felt to them.

I entered the dressing room as Melna was setting out her fidelant attire so I could help her tie the knots of her complex robes. I spoke not with my voice but with my the cold of my fingers.

She moved to the mirror and I followed her. The growing light of Ara had been shining through the window, and it bounced off the mirror and into my eyes as I walked toward it. I put my arm up to shield the light while she stood just barely in it.

She proceeded to wrap her cape around her shoulders and I took up the tying of her waistbelt behind her. The mauve color shined proudly in the daylight. I remembered dying them in a vat full of sedepin root, ensuring that the color was consistent and fast to the cloth. But still whenever I held it in my handsd, all I could see was its imperfections. Melna didn't seem to mind.

"This morning, you mentioned the cold air," I spoke hesitantly.

She didn't respond.

"The farmers have a responsibility, you know," I tried again to persuade her, "If a temperature drift is coming, we need to know so we aren't caught by an early-"

"Liffa... we've been over this. If I had evidence of drift, I would tell you."

She was a stone wall of secrets, and I, the climbing vine, would be unsatisfied until I had broken through. It was unfair for me to keep pushing when I knew she was bound to her duties, but I couldn't let her go without a promise

I placed a hand on her bare shoulder, "Look me in the eye," I pleaded. "Look at me and tell me you are not keeping secrets from the people of your province – from me."

She looked at me through the mirror for a moment, searching for motives in an innocent face. "I don't have time for this," she said coldly.

I let out a frustrated sigh and fled to the doorway to stop myself from saying something I'd regret.

"Liffa," she called to me before I could leave. I stopped without turning. "You know that I love you..."

I left.

Kipnu was still sitting in the kitchen, going over his schedule of patients and writing in a notebook. I passed through the great room, heading for the front door and hoping not to catch his eye.

"Your footsteps are rushed" he said, and I stopped, hoping for some wise, logical words to calm me down. "Is something the matter?"

"It's nothing..." I said.

"Melna and her secrets again, is it? Don't take it personally, Liffa. You know that's just how she is."

"For peace and province," I recited the fidelant motto with a troubled smirk.

He sighed, and spoke quietly, "You know we have to support her no matter what. She would crumble under the weight of her duties if not for us."

"I know... And I do," I said. "It's just..." I held my tongue, knowing he wouldn't be convinced. We'd had this conversation before.

Melna came back into the main room and looked at us, holding a pause of silent thought. "I'll be back a bit late tonight," she said. "Don't wait up for me."

"I wish you a good deliberation today," Kipnu chimed as he stood and approached her. "I know you'll do well."

Late wasn't particularly rare for her, but I wanted to pry. "What is it that will be keeping you so late?" I asked and Kipnu shot a glance of disapproval at me.

"Seroa has been pushing us on a grain resolution," she said. "Negotiations are likely to get complicated."

I looked into her eyes more intently, looking for some hint of deception. She wasn't one to show such things but I knew her better than anyone else. Something was off. I stood up and approached her as she turned to leave the house. With gentle hands, I turned her around and checked that her cords were tight and robe was creased correctly.

"Whatever it is you'll be talking about today," I said, "I'll be here when you return."

I embraced her as if she was going on a long journey. She was never too fond of touch, but today she raised her arms to reciprocate. "Thank you... Liffa."

Kipnu joined us, and I felt her body loosen up for a brief moment. I may have had doubts, but trust was the only thing that felt right in the moment.

Kipnu and I held each other close and watched as Melna began along her morning route without looking back. Her assistant Pomri stood with her gray-furred saffa at the side of the road, looking as palatial as always. The two of them together always gave me an uneasy feeling. _How strange a feeling... to envy my own bundwoman's assistant_.

"Something's different about her today," Kipnu said. "What were you two talking about?"

We watched Pomri help her onto the saffa. With a holler, the saffa stood and ferried them off to the train station. I held my binding pendant tightly, remembering that marriage was full of difficulties, and that this was only one.

"It was nothing," I said. "Just a chill in the air."
