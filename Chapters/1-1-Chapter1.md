## Chapter 1

"Lovely morning, Liffa."

Startled, I sat up to see a silhouette of Melna standing in the light, her hair dancing in time with the leaves.

"How long have you been here?" I asked.

"Just a moment. I figured you would be here today."

I stayed silent, still listening for the leaves and my mother's voice.

"You've been gone a while. Breakfast is ready soon."

"I'll be there in a bit."

She stared at me for a moment, I assume to size up my strange behavior.

"There's a chill in the air," she remarked, then turned to walk back home.

Kipnu was at the stove reheating a sweet mash of pohua with his morning face on. His hair resembled the furrowed nest of a bird that took a liking to the most crooked of branches. He looked up, locking his tired eyes to mine, and put on his laziest morning smile which only complimented his hair. I walked up to hug and nuzzle him good morning. Melna was squatting at a table in the great room, reading her daily missive of provincial news.

"Anything new?", I asked her.

"Not particularly. We're still running our typical surplus of fruits. People always request more of them than they actually need."

Kipnu chortled, looking at me. "Liffa here could probably eat the entire surplus herself."

"Sweets are my one joy in life," I replied with a smile. "Shame will never keep me from my one true love. Anyway, all the farmers I know dry-preserve what they don't sell."

"I'll pretend I didn't hear that," said Melna.

I stirred at the table, and then rose again to go bother Kipnu who had fallen asleep at the stove. With a gentle nudge, I moved him away and removed the pot from the focal point.

"A leaf would be great," I told him as I fetched a spoon.

Melna walked over to us to check on the food. "Let me make sure it's still like my mother used to make," she took out a spoon and dipped it into the pot. "Too thick - add some water"

I pulled some water from the dew column at the center of the great room and returned to add it to the mix little by little, waiting for Melna's approval.

Finally, we sat down to eat.

A moment of quiet slurping went by and I could see Melna's mind had moved onto a deeper thought. She released her pen and sat up in her chair, staring longingly out into the sunrise. I could tell she was thinking about traveling again. The three of us had joined too early before we could roam across the world.

"" I chimed at her.

"I am. It's been too long since we've gone anywhere."

Kipnu joined, "Last time was when we went to the North coast to live with the Hunnin for a week. I'll never forget how cold that was. Who's idea was that again?" He never missed a chance to remind me.

I defended my choice, "Hey, we all had fun uh... catching fish."

Melna and Kipnu smiled, knowing what I really meant.

"There was nothing else to do," Kipnu said.

"Yea, but I'd still do it again."

And I would. Because I was happy when they were around.

It was the apart times, when the waves of loneliness washed upon the cracks of my heart. Those were the moments when was keenly aware of how wholly incomplete I would always be.

I entered the dressing room as Melna was putting on her fidelant attire so I could help her tie the knots of her complex robes. I spoke not with my tongues but with my the cold of my fingers.

She moved to the mirror and I followed her. The growing light of Ara had been shining through the window, and it bounced off the mirror and into my eyes as I walked toward it. I put my arm up to shield the light while she stood just barely in it.

She proceeded to wrap her cape around her shoulders and I took up the tying of her waistbelt behind her. The mauve color of Heiko shined proudly in the daylight. I remembered dying them in Pohua, taking every care to ensure that the dye was consistent and fast to the cloth, but still I saw all of its imperfections whenever I looked at it. Melna didn't seem to mind.

"This morning, you mentioned the cold air," I spoke hesitantly.

She didn't respond.

"The farmers have a responsibility, you know," I tried again to persuade her, "If a temperature drift is coming, we need to know so we aren't caught by an early-"

"Liffa... we've been over this. If I had evidence of drift, I would tell you."

She was a stone wall of secrets, and I was unsatisfied until I could break through. But it was unfair of me to keep pushing on it when I knew she was bound to her duties. I wasn't letting her go without a promise.

I placed a hand on her bare shoulder, and pleaded, "Look me in the eye. Look at me and tell me you are not keeping secrets from your village. From your bounds."

She looked at me through the mirror for a moment, searching for motives in an innocent face.

"I don't have time for this," she said coldly.

I let out a frustrated sigh and made my way to the doorway of her room.

Before I could leave, she said, "Liffa..."

I stopped without turning.

"You know I love you."

I left.

Kipnu was going over his schedule of patients in the same spot we had left him. He looked up and took a glance at me, burying his head in the schedule again.

"Melna got you down?"

"How could you tell?"

"Ah you know."

I waited for him to elaborate.

"...Reasons."

_Thanks Kip..._

I mustered up a response, "Don't want to talk about it right now."

He wasn't convinced, but he was more accepting about these things than I was.

"Okay... suit yourself"

I stooped at the table with him and a long awkward silence filled the room while I watched him write notes in his schedule. Melna came downstairs and looked us over. She had a confused look for a brief moment, but resumed her departure.

"I'm headed to the train."

"Have a good day," he chimed. I stayed silent.

"I'll be back a bit late tonight. Don't wait up for me."

Late wasn't particularly rare for her, but I wanted to pry.

"Late? What for?" I asked.

"Yansha has been pushing us on this grain resolution."

I looked in her eyes more intently. Something about her eyes was very out of place. As if she had shut off her heart and it was wallowing in guilt. I stood up and approached her as she turned to leave the house.

"What are you doing?" She asked. I checked that her cords were tight and robe was creased correctly.

"Whatever it is you'll be arguing today, I'm here for you."

I embraced her as if she was going on a long journey. She was never too fond of touch, but today she raised her arms to reciprocate.

"Thank you. Liffa."

Kipnu walked up to us, and she loosened up enough to hug the both of us before opening the door to the outside. He and I watched as she entered the daylight without looking back. Her assistant Pomri, and her saffa stood by along the parkway, looking as palatial as always. The two of them together always gave me an uneasy feeling.

"What's going on between you two?" Kipnu asked again.

I held my binding pendant tightly and remembered that marriage was full of difficulties.

"Nothing," I said. "Just a chill in the air."
