# Part I: Liffa

_You cannot hear the first note of a ziyu's song. There is no grand entrance or catchy hook. No meandering conversation between a point and its counter. Each leaf is a gentle voice in a choir of the wind, finding its voice with the morning breeze. The tree is silent in the night, when the air is still and the stems curl up into themselves. But each morning, the light of Ara grows upon the horizon and awakens the breeze. You start to notice the sound, only it's been there for a while, and you can't place exactly when it began. By the time Ara is full, every leaf is perched and singing, their harmonies intertwined in unimaginable complexity._
