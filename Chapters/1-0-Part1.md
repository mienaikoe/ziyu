&nbsp;

_Love is a great force_

&nbsp;

_It counsels the mind in the law of nature_

_and brings prosperity to the living spirit._

&nbsp;

_It leads us all through trial and mirth_

_and brings us meaning when none remains._

&nbsp;

_But the wicked know as well as the wise_

_that love is vulnerable to corruption;_

_where by twisting and bending its weakest points_

_the mind and the spirit become imprisoned._

&nbsp;

_Love is a great force._
