## Chapter 13

Kipnu was silent on the long walk home, following the perimeter of the island to avoid guardians. Fanla walked next to him, trying in vain to think of something to say. They were both too shocked to think clearly.

"Kipnu," a maman called to him.

It was the young maman who held back his spear with hae words, hae black robes still drenched and arms folded around hae to keep warm. He looked back at hae, and slowed to match hae pace while Fanla kept a watchful eye to the forest, searching for an opening in the canopy where that fallen tree left a gap. The maman seemed to be teetering on malnourished and hae eyes were dark and sunken.

"Yes, Um.."

"Ginnu. Ginnu um Yansha."

Thi spoke slowly, with a slurred tone.

"Ginnu. You're the one joined to Ramne?"

"We're not joined... We're... partners."

He saw a pendant around her neck, but hadn't seen one around Ramne.

"Strange for a partner to leave you behind."

Thi went silent, and changed the subject.

"I want to be rid of him."

"Is that so?" Kipnu asked, unconvinced. "How far are you willing to go to prove it?"

"I will fight with you."

"And you would kill Ramne if it came to that?"

Thi paused, not having thought of that possibility.

"Look," Kipnu said, "I don't blame you for not wanting to hurt someone you care about, Ginnu. But Ramne's not the type to care about anyone. He wouldn't hesitate to kill you if he had to. Nothing but misery follows a man like that."

"He wouldn't. I lead him to the money."

"What do you do for him?"

"I sneak into places, unlock doors, overhear secrets and... other things. I know everything about Yansha."

"Does he pay you well?"

"...none of your business."

"Sounds like he's leading you on."

"We have an arrangement. We're both happy."

"What do you think he'll do the minute someone else comes along? I've heard he betrays the people closest to him when he's found someone better."

Ginnu kept walking with hae head faced forward.

"Kipnu," thi asked, "Why do you care so much about Casra?"

"There's something about hae. In the air thi has about hae."

"Love?"

He sighed. "Not exactly. It's hard to explain."

They arrived at the fallen tree and immediately divided into work teams. Fanla and the other sea-ready people took Casra's fishing nets to the southern shore to catch fish for dinner while the rest stayed behind to build a fire. Kipnu sat watching the twigs catching fire and thinking about what sort of torture Shinna had planned for Casra. Ginnu sat beside him, keeping the distance of a stranger.

"Kipnu," thi started. "I still want to fight."

"Well, you couldn't lift a dagger the way you are now."

"There are many ways to help."

The firewood had been added, and the flame began to take hold.

"Did Casra keep any herbs?" thi asked.

Kipnu recalled the flavors in the stew he had earlier. "A few," he said.

"Show me?"

Kipnu knew to keep a watchful eye on hae, but there didn't seem to be much harm in a few spices.

"Yea, let's go," he said.

He led hae to the hole and watched as thi felt around for the ladder. Thi seemed to have some trouble placing objects in hae eyesight, but finally made it down. He began to climb in, but before he landed his foot upon the ladder he heard footsteps, light and swift in the distance.

"Stay down there. I'll handle this," he told hae.

"Kipnu, we need to talk!," Setre yelled. Most of the others ran and hid in fear, but Kipnu stood his ground, held the stolen spear firmly in one hand and calmed them with the other.

"Setre, what are you doing here?" he asked.

She stopped just short of the range of his spear.

"How could you let this happen?" she asked. Her eyes were glassy, but her face was furious.

"My only kaln..." her lips quivered.

"Setre..." there was nothing to say.

She thrust her spear into the ground with a roar of anger.

"You should be the one in that water right now. The fact that you're standing here and Linyu is dead tells me everything I need to know."

"I nearly died trying to save hae."

"But you fucking didn't!"

She took up her spear again and cut the air clean in two, landing the blade squarely between Kipnu's feet. Her breaths were labored but she wasn't done, so Kipnu took up his spear and defended himself. The bystanders dared not get anywhere near them.

"Setre, stop this."

"I won't stop until you're dead."

She swung at him hard with Kipnu blocking each blow with a great deal of effort, moving him into the dark where she had the upper hand.

"Killing me won't change what's happened."

"Maybe not. But I'll feel a whole lot better."

She backed him onto a root in the ground and he lost his footing, stumbling onto his back. All he could see was the dark of the forest and the thin blue streaks of light on her skin.

"Give me one more reason I shouldn't kill you."

"Linyu had light in hae eyes."

Setre lowered her offense. "Are you certain?" she asked. "No, you're messing with me."

Kipnu didn't know why this intrigued her so much, but he continued.

"It's true. When I dove to pull hae back up, thi had distinctive blue light in hae eyes."

Setre's eyes remained narrow, untrusting of his words, as he tried his best to recall every detail he could remember.

"What has Casra told you about the blue?" she asked him, testing if his story held weight.

"The blue?" He was puzzled by her question, but tried to remember Casra saying something about it.

"It's just a side effect of Kanosin," he said.

"Answer the question."

"Thi said thi was and addict for a long time before Linyu came around."

"What else?"

"Wait. Are you saying you think Casra drugged hae? But that's ridiculous, why would she drown hae own kaln?"

A series of thoughts went into motion in Setre's mind. Her eyes went blank, and her stance weakened to a slow pace around in a circle. Kipnu took the moment to stand back up and fetch his spear.

"Let's talk inside," she said.

"You almost killed me," he protested. "Can we talk about _that_ for a second?"

"I wasn't really going to kill you," she said so soberly that he wasn't sure she was the same person anymore. "It was cathartic just to watch you fear for your life."

She turned away from him and began walking back the way they came, ambling to Casra's old home.

"What the fuck?" he said to himself, and took off after her.

He took the ladder first, remembering that Ginnu was still below.

"Spears off!" he demanded, and she spent another moment looking for an inconspicuous place to stow her spear. Ginnu was nowhere to be found, but had left a lantern on the kitchen table, filled with fresh anomin oil that filled the air with its piney scent. He wondered where thi went, but was glad that the problem had resolved itself.

Setre had leapt from the ledge and landed on the ground of the entryway, bypassing the ladder altogether. Kipnu was hardly surprised by her acrobatic feats anymore. She fetched a cup from the kitchen and filled it with water from a spigot in the wall. The battle had parched his throat, and so he did the same.

Setre spoke to him over the dish cleaning basin.

"Casra has a plan that not even I understand. But what you told me out there sparked an idea in my head. Before you came along, hae plan was to secretly recruit as many of hae old followers as thi could and slowly start a resistance. What thi didn't anticipate was the power of Shinna's spy network to discover them. So thi had to scrap that idea after we spoke today. Instead, thi would have to build an army - far from the influence of Shinna. Thi was afraid that such a big battle would be dangerous for anyone on the island and that's why thi agreed to send you back home with Linyu."

"But, that all went terribly wrong," he said.

"There are things about Kanosin that even the best doctors in Palinan don't know about; things that only a kanosin addict could ever understand. And you mainlanders sent all of them here in hopes that they would never return."

"Kanosin is just a drug. There's not much to know."

"You are terribly mistaken, Kipnu. But you would dismiss me even if I told you. But if what you said is true, then it means they planned for everything to happen this way. Casra saw Ramne and knew that he would inadvertently bring more attention to hae. And thi was right. He came to the pavilion bragging about capturing Casra, and it started a chaotic mess of infighting. That was the first shot fired, but thi's counting on two more to force a bloodless surrender: a small but knowledgeable resistance within Shinna's ranks, and a much larger force made up of the strangers from the shoreline. Thi's gambled it all on me and you to finish the job."

He stood up and faced the wall adjacent to the ladder.

"I just got here yesterday, Setre. How can I lead an army?"

"No, Kipnu. Every person out there followed you here."

"They didn't have a better choice."

"They had the choice of trusting you or trusting Ramne."

He let out a sigh. "And what about our numbers? There are ten times as many people at the pavilion."

Setre smirked and said, "Only a few hundred guardians can actually fight. And half of them are Casra's old tribemates. Besides, we have these."

She pointed to a listener on her ear, a bit old but well taken care of.

"The listeners? The whole invisible wall thing is amazing, but isn't it just a toy."

"Have you ever considered how you could use it in a battle?"

"Well... no."

"Of course not. When Casra first told me about the listeners, I realized they could be used to deliver tactical information quickly and quietly. Messenger saffas are used for slower, more strategic information, but if you need to know where your opponent is weakest or how they're changing their strategy, nothing can beat a listener. You can station people high up in the trees who can see land, and dyour whole army can pin down the guardians and tie them up before anyone can make sense of what has happened."

"That's brilliant. But what if Shinna has them too?"

"As hae best and worst spy, trust me when I say that thi dismissed it just the same way you did when thi found out about it."

<!-- left off -->

He continued his questions, "Okay, so how do we even locate guardians?"

"They all have markings like mine. Impossible to miss in the dark."

"Seems like a major oversight. That's unlike hae."

"The Guardians rely on fear and intimidation. The blue light is so we can see our enemies clearly while they are disoriented by flashes of light."

"But that means you'll look just like the others."

"I'll be elsewhere, looking for Casra."

"Looking for hae?"

"It's rare for us to have a prisoner - most are just drugged and then they obey. But when Casra arrived, Shinna hid hae somewhere I don't know about."

"Where do you suppose they hid?"

"I don't know, but there's not much around besides trees."

"So what should we do? They could come back at any time."

"You have radio. If they come back at a bad time, change your strategy."

He sighed, overwhelmed with responsibility, "You make this sound easy. Maybe you should be there with us. We can find Casra together afterward."

"It's easier than you think. If your team is in danger, call a retreat. If they've already taken the guardians down, then just tell them to hide and wait for one of us. I really need to find Casra - she could be in great danger. I'll have a listener in my ear in case things go very wrong."

Kipnu let out a sigh but Setre didn't give him the time to doubt himself again, "Kipnu, you need to commit this map to memory. When you look down at us from the trees, and see nothing but fire and blue lights, you'll need to imagine this map imprinted in the ground so you can tell your team where to go."

He took the lantern from Setre and studied the ground while she moved to the hay bed where Linyu was fidgeting with a box that Kipnu assumed was a transmitter. For a moment, Setre began to show a softer side, a natherly side, while Kipnu snuck glances at the two, but Linyu didn't share the same warmth that Setre had. He wondered if Setre chose to silently face her regrets or just ignore them altogether. Whichever it was, it got her this far without turning into the disgusting person Ramne had turned into.

"How's that map?" Setre asked.

"I think I've got it."

"Where's the armory?"

"Whoa we're doing a quiz? Uhh directly East of the great fire."

"And the slaves tents?"

"Directly east of that"

"Where are the entrances to the Great Pavilion?"

He smirked and said, "I knew you put those stakes in the drawing for a reason. The whole perimeter is an entrance."

"You are ready," Setre said with a smile. "Now let's go prepare the rest of them. Linyu, go have some dinner with the group. We'll be right behind you."

Once Linyu had left, Setre became very somber.

"There's one more thing we haven't discussed yet."

"Is it about Linyu?"

"No. It's about what happened last night."

Kipnu was listening, but felt a slight panic ensuing.

"Kipnu, I've been thinking... what if I get pregnant from last night?"

Setre struggled to finish the sentence, her sighs unwavering in their interruptions. His arm went to her shoulder and she lifted her own to catch it and hold it. They shared a moment that was not romantic, but placid.

Kipnu swore to her, "Set, if it is true that you're pregnant, and if you decide to keep it. I swear to you that I will do everything to make sure our child will not just have one parent."

Setre refused to cry, but Kipnu didn't have the same mental strength. He leaned into her and took a moment to let out all of what had happened to him as tears on her shoulder. Setre wrapped her arms around him, letting a single tear of understanding fall on his neck.

Once Kipnu had calmed back down, Setre said to him, "Alright. let's get some dinner."

"Yea. Let's go," he said.

When they arrived in the circle the whole group was around the fire, already having eaten their share of fish. Lin had saved three for them, giving two to Setre and one to Kipnu. _Fair_, he thought. The group took turns introducing themselves to everyone while the two of them ate. Some had come as families bound and unbound, and some were individuals who had heard stories of Ulukoma from people they knew. The younger ones only knew that Ulukoma was a mysterious island where prisoners survived in the dark, and decided to throw their lives at it in a panic.

Once they were done, Kipnu asked Linyu to prepare the radio transmitter. He gathered the group into a circle and divided all of the listeners amongst them, giving them first to the healthiest among them. He helped Ginnu hold it in hae tied hands and keep it on hae ear.

"Mamen, men, women. Linyu is about to demonstrate something that will be crucial to our plan. What I've given each of you is called a listener. Casra made them here, and entrusted them to hae kaln and myself. Now, I entrust them to you. Put them up to your ears, and make sure to pass them around to the people around you."

Kipnu sent a nod in Linyu's direction which thi confirmed and moved to the transmitter box, connecting the battery to it with well-worn wires of steel. With a clear of the throat, as hae mother had done, thi began to sing the same song that Casra had sung to Kipnu. He watched as the group slowly began to comprehend what they were hearing, their faces lighting up with awe as they looked back at Kipnu. Casra's presence was filling the air like an invisible spirit of knowledge. He looked back at Linyu who for only a moment cracked a small smile.

Ginnu looked intently toward him without a trace of the doubt thi had before. Thi asked, "How is this possible?"

Kipnu told her, "The wind speaks. And we listen."

<!--
  -- Setre Finds Ginnu
  -->

"How did you get here?" she asked, suspicious of the maman.

Startled, Ginnu shot hae head toward Setre and abruptly closed the herb box. By the time Kipnu had made it down the ladder, Setre had already emptied hae hands and pushed Ginnu toward Kipnu.

"What's this all about?" Kipnu demanded, but Setre ignored him, pulled a modest length of rope from a buttoned loop on the back of her tunic and held it in front of her like a weapon. Ginnu's expression was that of fear as thi kept hae distance from both of them. But thi couldn't escape from Setre, who swiftly grabbed hae wrists and tied them behind hae back.

"Ginnu is a spy. Thi must be silenced," she responded, struggling to keep hae still.

"Always death," Kipnu grumbled to himself, "When does it end."

Setre bound Ginnu's ankles as well and sat hae down near the ladder while Kipnu sat at the table. Ginnu didn't bother to fight; thi was looking at the ground, shaking with fear, tears in hae eyes.

Kipnu pleaded to her, "This is too much. Ginnu's done nothing to sow distrust."

"That is exactly how Shinna's spies work. They make you think they're on your side until they vanish one day and your enemies know everything about you. Thi already knows that I'm here. What else have you told hae?"

"Nothing that the others don't know."

"And what _do_ they know? There might be others."

He sighed and stood up, frustrated. "Look, we'll just leave hae here and come back for hae once Casra's plan is over."

"And then what? Thi lives the rest of hae life as a prisoner? As long as Kanosin exists in this world, theives like hae will do whatever it takes to keep it alive."

Ginnu interrupted her, "I'm trying to escape this madness. Unlike you, Guardian Setre."

Setre moved like a lightning bolt across the room and lifted Ginnu by hae shirt, to which thi made no noise of fear or surprise.

"And unlike you," she said, "I'm trying to stop it."

Kipnu drew her away from Ginnu. "Setre, what's gotten into you?"

Ginnu breathed heavy and sank into the floor. Kipnu felt pity for hae, but Setre was not amused.

Kipnu suggested to the group, "I'll set hae around the fire with the others. When I come back, we'll talk."

"You're better off throwing hae into it."

Kipnu shot her a glare, and then climbed up the ladder, stopping at the top to lift Ginnu up by the shoulders. He carried hae in his arms toward the now roaring fire. The fishing party had just returned with a enough food for everyone, and the smell was filling the air. On a soft patch of ground, he set hae down at a comfortable distance away while the others stared at them in curiosity.

"Why is thi tied up?" asked a maman.

"Nothing. It's Setre."

"Tried to take a swing at her, eh?" the maman asked.

"No nothing like that. I'm worried thi might run away."

"To Ramne, you mean," said a man.

"Yes, to Ramne. Listen, even if Ginnu is planning something, Ramne will want hae back safe and sound. At worst, Ginnu is a bargaining chip, and at best, a skilled informant. If I come back and anything has happened to hae, you will answer to the giant warrior in the house."

They heeded his bluff of a warning, and as he turned he paused to check on Ginnu again.

"Thank you," thi whispered to him through tearful eyes. If this was all an act, it was quite convincing.

Setre was sitting on the bed with a lantern, engrossed in all the random trinkets Linyu kept on a table nearby. She didn't notice Kipnu as he came back in.

"Ginnu won't be going anywhere."

"The minute thi knows what you're up to, thi will run and tell Ramne."

"Look. Thi can't go back to the pavilion, and she can't just stay tied up here in the cold. Leave Ginnu with me."

"Like I left Casra and Linyu with you?"

She sighed and held her head with her hand, a tinge of regret in her expression.

"You better keep your eyes on hae. Thi could be the end of us all."

"I will."
