## Chapter 13


  Lin was silent on the walk home. Kip was walking next to hae, trying in vain to think of comforting things to say, but he held hae hand in the hopes that it would provide some comfort. He tried to meet the people in the group, but there were too many altogether.

  "Kipnu," the woman called to him.

  Her robe had not quite dried yet and she was folding her hands to keep warm on their walk to Casra's safehouse. He looked back at her, and slowed to match her pace.

  "Yes, Um.."

  "Ginnu. Ginnu um Holragi."

  "Ginnu. You're the one bound to Ramne?"

  "We are not bound, we're business partners."

  "And yet he left you behind?"

  She went silent, and changed the subject.

  "I know it may seem strange, that I chose to go with you and not him, but I wanted to tell you that I support your efforts."

  "Is that so?" Kip asked, unconvinced. "How far are you willing to go to prove it?"

  "I cooked for Ramne, I can cook for a hundred. Or I'll fight alongside you."

  "And you would kill Ramne if it came to that?"

  She paused, not having thought of that possibility.

  "I didn't think so," said Kip. "Look, I don't blame you for not wanting to hurt someone you care about, Ginnu. But Ramne is not the kind of man who would hesitate to kill you if he had to. You have to distance yourself from him and anyone else who might try to protect Lissa."

  "He just likes hae for the money. He wouldn't touch me."

	"What do you do for him?"

	"I sell the goods. I know the streets of Yansha like the skin on my knees."

  "You're expendable to him. Just like Casra was when Lissa came along."

	She kept walking with her head faced forward, and a pout on her lips.

	"Kipnu," she asked, "Why do you care so much about Casra? Ram and I have met every tribe leader on this island and no one has ever mentioned your name."

	"There's something here. A key to unlock something bigger than any of us can imagine."

	"Are you high or something?"

	He sighed. "You wouldn't understand."

	They arrived at the fallen tree and immediately divided into work teams. Some of the experienced in the group took Casra's fishing nets to the southern shore to catch fish for dinner while the rest stayed behind to build a fire. Kipnu sat watching the smoldering twigs and thinking about what sort of torture Lissa had planned for Casra.

	"Kipnu?" Linyu broke his silence for the first time since coming home.

	"Linyu!" he said with a smile, and hugged hae. "How are you feeling?"

	"I want to fight."

	"Linyu, it's dangerous out there. Your mother would never forgive me if something happened to you."

	"But mom needs me."

	He held hae hands in his own.

	"You're right, Linyu. But there are many ways to help that don't put your life in danger."

  The firewood had been gathered, and a flame started. Ginnu was itching to build friendships, so she asked them, "Hey you two, did Casra ever keep any spices here?"

  Linyu said, "Yea, plenty."

  "Would you mind showing me?"

  Kip retained some suspicion and said, "Yea, let's go," to make sure she wasn't alone with Linyu.

  He followed behind them and waited until they entered, but before he entered he heard footsteps, hard and fast in the distance.

  "You two go down. I'll handle this," he told them.

	"Kipnu, we need to talk!," Setre yelled. Most of the group members ran and hid in fear, but Kip stood his ground, and held his hand out to tell them it was ok.

	"Setre, what are you doing here?"

  "No time, let's talk in the house"

  "Oh.. uh ok," he said.

  Setre barely jumped off the ladder into the safehouse when she started talking again.

  "Cas' plan is working, but I need you toâ€“... Oh hey Linyu," she said, surprised at seeing hae face in the lantern light.

  Next to Linyu was Ginnu who was rummaging through the herb box with her own lantern, and she asked in a suspicious tone, "How did you get here?"

  Startled, Ginnu shot her head toward Setre and abruptly closed the herb box. Kipnu got off the ladder and set his arm on Setre's shoulder.

  "It's alright," he said, oblivious to the tension in the room. "This is Ginnu. She's with us."

  A long pause punctuated the air, and Setre pierced through it.

	"Get the fuck away from my kaln," she said.

	Ginnu's face was unchanged as she walked closer to them and the ladder. When she got close enough, Setre swiftly grabbed her wrists and held them behind her back.

	Ginnu rebuked her, "Get your hands off me."

	"Lin, get me some rope," said Setre.

	Kip was perplexed, "What's this all about?"

	"Ginnu is one of the spies I was telling you about," she responded, struggling to keep Ginnu still.

	Kip was growing tired of secrets. *How many hidden identities are people keeping on this island?*

	"Everyone has at least one," Setre said, and he suddenly realized that his question hadn't stayed fully in his head.

	Linyu scurried up the ladder and quickly came back with a handfull of strong rope - a thicker variant of the material used for their clothing. Setre first bound Ginnu's wrists, and then hae feet, and then sat her down near the entrance. Ginnu had begun crying and sat still looking ground.

	"Save your tears for Lissa."

	Kip pleaded to her, "You've gone too far, Setre. Ginnu's been nothing but helpful ever since she arrived on this island."

	"This is exactly how Lissa's spies work. She makes you think she's on your side until she steals all your advantages and gives them to Lissa. She already knows that I'm working with you. What have you told her about?"

	"A little about radio. She thought I was crazy."

	"By Ara, are you thick?"

	Kip was getting frustrated with Setre's sensationalism. "Look, we'll just leave her here and come back for her when we've taken the Shadestead."

	"And then what? She's lives the rest of her life as a prisoner? As long as Kanosin exists in this world, she will do whatever it takes to get it."

	Ginnu interrupted her, "You aren't such an angel yourself, Guardian of Ulu. Unlike you I'm trying to be free of the madness that goes on here."

	Setre lifted her by her shirt and she shouted in pain, but Setre maintained her hold and said, "And unlike you, I'm trying to stop it."

	Kip put himself in between them and shouted, "Setre, what's gotten into you? Let's figure this out later. For now, Ginnu, we'll have to keep you tied up. I'm sorry it had to be this way, but Setre is right about the danger you pose."

	Ginnu nodded her head and sank back into herself. Kip felt pity for her, but Setre was not amused.

	He told Setre, "I'll take her to the fire. When I come back, we'll talk."

	"You'd be better off throwing her into it."

	Kip shot her a glare, and then climbed up the ladder, stopping at the top to lift Ginnu up by the shoulders. He carried her in his arms toward the now roaring fire. The fishing party had just returned with a large amount of fish and bluekelp for the group. On a soft patch of ground, he set her down at a comfortable distance away while the others stared at them in curiosity.

	"What's she tied up for?" asked a maman.

	"It's nothing big, but I'd prefer not to say right now."

	"Tried to take a swing at you, did she?" the maman asked.

	"No nothing like that. We just need some privacy right now, and I'm worried she might run away."

	"To Ramne, you mean."

	"Yes, and he might want her back so keeping her here and healthy is a good thing. If I come back and any one of you has taken advantage of her vulnerable position, you will answer to the giant warrior in the house."

	They heeded his bluff of a warning, and as he turned he paused to check on Ginnu again.

	"Thank you," she whispered to him through tearful eyes. If this was all an act, she was quite convincing.

	Setre was drawing of a map on the rocky ground of the safehouse with some charcoal and a lantern, too engrossed to greet Kip as he came back in.

	He squatted down to her level and said the first word, "Setre. When you first arrived, you mentioned that Casra had a plan and that it was working. What did you mean by that?"

	"Casra kept this plan from you because you were completely unexpected. You came out of nowhere, you saved Linyu, and got caught up in this war of secrets. But now when I look at you, leading a band of hundreds, picking up where Casra left; I can tell thi made the right choice to pull you out of Lissa's reach."

	"I would be honored, but I know thi only did it expecting I would help hae. There have been many times when I doubted hae vision and my role in it."

	"You're still here, ready to unseat a sociopathic brute from hae throne in the biggest cartel in Palinan."

	"I guess I can't complain then," he said.

	"So, the plan. Casra had originally intended to be captured by Lissa in an effort to rally hae old followers closer to each other. Lin and I would then start a resistance from this group, and overtake hae. What Casra didn't anticipate was the power of Lissa's spy network to thwart the resistance. Thi had to build an army instead - far from the influences of Lissa, and she started by plucking you straight from under the Shadestead. Thi took a chance that you would be able to lead the army when the time came. So when she saw hundreds of people on the shore, and a greedy Ramne, she didn't run. She's dedicated her whole life to this plan, and now she's gambled it all on you, Kipnu."

	He stood up and faced the wall adjacent to the ladder.

	"I'm just a doctor who got here yesterday, Setre. I will do the best I can, but I really don't know what I'm doing."

	"No, Kipnu. Every person out there followed you here."

	"They didn't have a better choice."

	"They had the choice of trusting you or trusting Ram."

	He let out a sigh. "And what about our numbers? We are outnumbered ten to one."

	Setre smirked and said, "There are only a few hundred who can actually fight. And half of them are Casra's old tribemates. And besides, you have radio."

	"The listeners? The whole invisible wall thing is revolutionary, but those listeners are just toys."

	"Kipnu, have you ever considered how you could use it in a battle."

	"Well... no."

	"Of course the doctor wouldn't have. When Casra first told me about the listeners, I asked hae about whether Lissa could use them against us and thi laughed at me. But then thi realized that they could be used to deliver secrets or convey plans instantly. Messengers are used for strategy, but the listeners can be used for tactics. If you hide up in the trees surveying the Shadestead, your whole army can pin down the guardians and tie them up before anyone can make sense of the inevitable chaos."

	"That's brilliant, but how can I transmit from trees?"

	"You think that big tree out there is the only one Casra made? Thi and Linyu wrapped countless trees when they lived there and Linyu made a small transmitter box that can work with any of them."

	"Linyu?"

	Thi nodded and said, "I like climbing, and mom wanted to know where I was when I did."

	Kip smiled at him, impressed and thinking of Casra.

	He continued his questions, "Okay, so how do we even locate guardians?"

	"They all have markings like mine. Impossible to miss in the dark."

	"Seems like an oversight. That's unlike hae."

	"The Guardians rely on fear and intimidation. The blue light is so we can see our enemies clearly while they see nothing but a flash of light."

	"But that means you'll look just like the others."

	"I'll be out looking for Casra."

	"Looking for hae?"

	"It's rare for us to have a prisoner - most are just drugged and then they obey. But when Casra arrived, Lissa took hae to the East and they haven't been seen since then."

	"Where do you suppose they hid?"

	"I don't know, but there's not much over there besides trees and snow."

	"Snow?"

	"Ah yea there's no snow on the mainland is there? Snow is fun."

	"So what should we do? They could come back at any time."

	"You have radio. If they come back at a bad time, change your strategy."

	He sighed, overwhelmed with responsibility, "You make this sound easy. Maybe you should be there with us. We can find Casra together afterward."

	"It's easier than you think. If your team is in danger, call a retreat. If they've already taken the guardians down, then just tell them to hide and wait for one of us. I really need to find Casra - she could be in great danger. I'll have a listener in my ear in case things go very wrong."

	Kip let out a sigh but Setre didn't give him the time to doubt himself again, "Kipnu, you need to commit this map to memory. When you look down at us from the trees, and see nothing but fire and blue lights, you'll need to imagine this map imprinted in the ground so you can tell your team where to go."

	He took the lantern from Setre and studied the ground while she moved to the hay bed where Linyu was fidgeting with a box that Kip assumed was a transmitter. For a moment, Setre began to show a softer side, a natherly side, while Kip snuck glances at the two, but Linyu didn't share the same warmth that Setre had. He wondered if Setre chose to silently face her regrets or just ignore them altogether. Whichever it was, it got her this far without turning into the disgusting person Ramne had turned into.

	"How's that map?" Setre asked.

	"I think I've got it."

	"Where's the armory?"

	"Whoa we're doing a quiz? Uhh directly East of the great fire."

	"And the slaves tents?"

	"Directly east of that"

	"Where are the entrances to the Great Tent?"

	He smirked and said, "I knew you put those stakes in the drawing for a reason. The whole perimeter is an entrance."

	"You are ready," Setre said with a smile. "Now let's go prepare the rest of them. Linyu, go have some dinner with the group. We'll be right behind you."

	Once Linyu had left, Setre became very somber.

	"There's one more thing we haven't discussed yet."

	"Is it about Linyu?"

	"No. It's about what happened last night."

	Kip was listening, but felt a slight panic ensuing.

	"Kip, I've been thinking... what if I get pregnant from last night?"

	Setre struggled to finish the sentence, her sighs unwavering in their interruptions. His arm went to her shoulder and she lifted her own to catch it and hold it. They shared a moment that was not romantic, but placid.

	Kip swore to her, "Set, if it is true that you're pregnant, and if you decide to keep it. I swear to you that I will do everything to make sure our child will not just have one parent."

	Setre refused to cry, but Kip didn't have the same mental strength. He leaned into her and took a moment to let out all of what had happened to him as tears on her shoulder. Setre wrapped her arms around him, letting a single tear of understanding fall on his neck.

	Once Kip had calmed back down, Setre said to him, "Alright. let's get some dinner."

	"Yea. Let's go," he said.

	When they arrived in the circle the whole group was around the fire, already having eaten their share of fish. Lin had saved three for them, giving two to Setre and one to Kip. *Fair*, he thought. The group took turns introducing themselves to everyone while the two of them ate. Some had come as families bound and unbound, and some were individuals who had heard stories of Ulukoma from people they knew. The younger ones only knew that Ulukoma was a mysterious island where prisoners survived in the dark, and decided to throw their lives at it in a panic.

	Once they were done, Kip asked Linyu to prepare the radio transmitter. He gathered the group into a circle and divided all of the listeners amongst them, giving them first to the healthiest among them.

	"Mamen, men, women. Linyu is about to demonstrate something that will be crucial to our cause tonight. What I've given each of you is called a listener. Casra made them here, and entrusted them to hae kaln and myself. Now, I entrust them to you. Put them up to your ears, and make sure to pass them around to the people around you."

	Kip sent a nod in Linyu's direction which thi confirmed and moved to the transmitter box, connecting the battery to it with well-worn wires of steel. With a clear of the throat, as hae mother had done, thi began to sing the same song that Casra had sung to Kip. He watched as the group slowly began to comprehend what they were hearing, their faces lighting up with awe as they looked back at Kipnu. Casra's presence was filling the air like an invisible spirit of knowledge. He looked back at Linyu who for only a moment cracked a small smile.

	Ginnu paced quickly toward him without a trace of the doubt she had before. She asked, "How is this possible?"

	Kip said, "The wind speaks."

  Setre said, "And Ulu listens."
