## Chapter 13


  Lin was silent on the walk back home. Kip was walking next to hae, trying to think of comforting things to say, but nothing seemed appropriate for the moment.

  "Kipnu," the woman called to him.

  She was clothed in a long black robe that hadn't quite dried yet, folding her hands to keep warm on their walk to Casra's safehouse. He looked back at her, and slowed to match her pace.

  "Yes, Um.."

  "Ginnu. Ginnu um Holragi."

  "Ginnu. You're the one bound to Ramne?"

  "We are not bound, we're business partners."

  "And yet he left you behind?"

  She went silent, and changed the subject.

  "I know it may seem strange, that I chose to go with you and not him, but I wanted to tell you that I support your efforts."

  "Is that so?" Kip asked, unconvinced. "How far are you willing to go to prove it?"

  "I'll make weapons, I'll cook food, I'll fight alongside you."

  "And you would kill Ramne if it came to that?"

  She paused, not having thought of that possibility.

  "I didn't think so," said Kip. "Look, I don't blame you for not wanting to kill someone you care about, Ginnu. Even if he wouldn't hesitate to kill you. If you're going to stick with us, you have to distance yourself with anyone who might try to protect Lissa."

  "He wouldn't protect hae. He just likes hae for the money. Casra would find him a different job."

  "I wouldn't count on it."

  "Do you even know their relationship?"

  "Their hostility was pretty apparent back there."

  "He's Linyu's father."

  "Hah! You expect me to believe that? Casra was bound when thi got here."

  "Everyone here lives a second life. Even Casra."

  Linyu broke hae silence, and said, "It's true. Ram is my father."

  Kip remembered that Casra had told him about hae darker life, but he never thought thi would be with a man like that.
