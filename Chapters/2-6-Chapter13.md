## Chapter 13

Lin was silent on the walk home. Kipnu was walking next to hae, trying in vain to think of comforting things to say, but he held hae hand in the hopes that it would provide some comfort. He tried to meet the people in the group, but there were too many altogether.

"Kipnu," a maman called to him.

It was the young maman who had begged Ramne to stop, hae black robes still drenched and arms folded around hae to keep warm. He looked back at hae, and slowed to match hae pace. Thi seemed a bit too thin to be healthy and hae eyes were dark and sunken.

"Yes, Um.."

"Ginnu. Ginnu um Holrag."

"Ginnu. You're the one joined to Ramne?"

"We're... partners."

He realized the lack of a pendant around her neck.

"Is that why he left you behind?"

Thi went silent, and changed the subject.

"I know it may seem strange, that I chose to go with you and not him, but I really do support your efforts."

"Is that so?" Kipnu asked, unconvinced. "How far are you willing to go to prove it?"

"I will fight alongside you."

"And you would kill Ramne if it came to that?"

Thi paused, not having thought of that possibility.

"Look," Kipnu said, "I don't blame you for not wanting to hurt someone you care about, Ginnu. But Ramne doesn't seem like the kind of man who would hesitate to kill you if he had to. You'll know nothing but misery if you stay with him or anyone else who might try to protect Shinna."

"He just likes hae for the money. He wouldn't touch me."

    "What do you do for him?"

    "I was Ramne's thief. I snuck into places and unlocked doors. I know Rudjan and Yansha like the skin on my knees."

    "Does he pay you well?"

    "That's none of your business."

"Sounds like he has the better end of the deal."

    "We have an arrangement. We're both happy with it."

    "What do you think he'll do the minute someone else comes along? What did he do to Casra when Shinna came along."

    Ginnu kept walking with hae head faced forward, and a pout on hae lips.

    "Kipnu," she asked, "Why do you care so much about Casra? Ramne and I have met every tribe leader on this island and no one has ever mentioned your name."

    "There's something here. A key to something bigger."

    "You high or something?"

    He sighed. "It's hard to explain."

    They arrived at the fallen tree and immediately divided into work teams. Some of the experienced in the group took Casra's fishing nets to the southern shore to catch fish for dinner while the rest stayed behind to build a fire. Kipnu sat watching the smoldering twigs and thinking about what sort of torture Shinna had planned for Casra.

    "Kipnu?" Linyu broke his silence for the first time since coming home.

    "Linyu!" he said with a smile, and hugged hae. "How are you feeling?"

    "I want to fight."

    "Linyu, it's dangerous out there. Your mother would never forgive me if something happened to you."

    "But mom needs me."

    He held hae hands in his own.

    "You're right, Linyu. But there are many ways to help that don't put your life in danger."

The firewood had been gathered, and a flame started. Ginnu was itching to make friends, so she asked them, "Hey you two, did Casra ever keep any herbs here?"

Linyu said, "A few."

"Would you mind showing me?"

Kipnu retained some suspicion and said, "Yea, let's go," to make sure she wasn't alone with Linyu.

He followed behind them and waited until they entered, but before he could climb in he heard footsteps, light and swift in the distance.

"You two go down. I'll handle this," he told them.

    "Kipnu, we need to talk!," Setre yelled. Most of the group members ran and hid in fear, but Kipnu stood his ground, and held his hand out to to calm them.

    "Setre, what are you doing here?" he asked.

"No time, let's talk in the house."

"Oh.. uh ok," he said.

Setre barely jumped off the ladder when she started talking again.

"Cas' plan is working, but I need you toâ€“... Oh hey Linyu," she said, surprised at seeing hae face in the lantern light.

Standing next to Linyu was Ginnu, rummaging through the herb box with hae own lantern, and she asked in a suspicious tone, "How did you get here?"

Startled, Ginnu shot hae head toward Setre and abruptly closed the herb box. Kipnu got off the ladder and set his arm on Setre's shoulder.

"It's alright," he said, oblivious to the tension in the room. "Thi's with us."

She ignored him and forced her way between Ginnu and Linyu.

    "Get out," she commanded.

    Ginnu's face was unchanged as thi walked closer to them and the ladder. When thi got close enough, Setre swiftly grabbed hae wrists and held them behind hae back.

    Ginnu rebuked her, "Get your hands off me."

    "Lin, get me some rope," said Setre.

    "What's this all about?" Kipnu demanded.

    "Ginnu is a spy. Thi must be silenced," she responded, struggling to keep hae still.

    Kipnu was growing tired of death. *How many grudges are people keeping on this island?*

    Linyu scurried up the ladder and quickly came back with a handful of strong rope - a thicker variant of the material used for their clothing. Setre bound Ginnu's wrists and ankles and then sat hae down near the entrance. Ginnu glared at her with teary eyes and sat still looking at the ground.

    "Save your tears."

    Kipnu pleaded to her, "This is too much, Setre. Ginnu's done nothing to sow distrust."

    "This is exactly how Shinna's spies work. They make you think they're on your side until they vanish one day and your enemies know everything about you. Thi already knows that I'm working with you. What have you told hae about?"

    "A little about the listener things. Thi thought I was crazy."

    Setre was incredulous. "By Ara, are you thick?"

    Kipnu was getting frustrated. "Look, we'll just leave hae here and come back for hae when we've taken over."

    "And then what? Thi lives the rest of hae life as a prisoner? As long as Kanosin exists in this world, theives like hae will do whatever it takes to keep it alive."

    Ginnu interrupted her, "I'm trying to escape this madness. Unlike you, Guardian Setre."

    Setre lifted Ginnu by hae shirt, to which hae shouted in pain, but Setre maintained her hold.

    "And unlike you, I'm trying to stop it."

    Kipnu put himself in between them and shouted, "Setre, what's gotten into you?"

    Ginnu breathed heavy and sank into the floor. Kipnu felt pity for hae, but Setre was not amused.

    Kipnu suggested to the group, "I'll set hae around the fire with the others. When I come back, we'll talk."

    "You'd be better off throwing hae into it."

    Kipnu shot her a glare, and then climbed up the ladder, stopping at the top to lift Ginnu up by the shoulders. He carried hae in his arms toward the now roaring fire. The fishing party had just returned with a large amount of fish and bluekelp for the group. On a soft patch of ground, he set hae down at a comfortable distance away while the others stared at them in curiosity.

    "What's thi tied up for?" asked a maman.

    "It's nothing big, but I'd prefer not to say right now."

    "Tried to take a swing at you, did thi?" the maman asked.

    "No nothing like that. We just need some privacy right now, and I'm worried thi might run away."

    "To Ramne, you mean."

    "Yes, to Ramne. Listen, he might want hae back so keeping hae here and healthy is a good thing. If I come back and anything has happened to Ginnu, you will answer to the giant warrior in the house."

    They heeded his bluff of a warning, and as he turned he paused to check on Ginnu again.

    "Thank you," thi whispered to him through tearful eyes. If this was all an act, thi was quite convincing.

    Setre was drawing a map on the ground with some charcoal and a lantern, too engrossed to greet Kipnu as he came back in.

    "What was that about, Setre?"

    "Do you want to win this or not?"

    "Thi doesn't pose a threat to us."

    "The minute thi knows what you're up to, thi will run and tell Ramne."

    "Look. Thi can't go back to the pavilion, and she can't just stay tied up here in the cold. Leave Ginnu with me."

    She sighed. "You better keep your eyes on hae."

    "You know I will."

    He squatted down to her level and reset his focus, "Setre. When you first arrived, you mentioned that Casra had a plan and that it was working. What did you mean by that?"

    "Casra kept this plan from you because you were completely unexpected. You came out of nowhere, you saved Linyu, and got caught up in this war of secrets. But now when I look at you, leading a band of hundreds, picking up where Casra left; I can tell thi made the right choice to pull you out of Shinna's reach."

    "I would be honored, but I know thi only did it expecting I would help hae. There have been many times when I doubted hae vision and my role in it."

    "You're still here, ready to unseat a sociopathic brute from hae throne in the biggest cartel in Palinan."

    "I guess I can't complain then," he said.

    "So, the plan. Casra had originally intended to be captured by Shinna in an effort to rally hae old followers closer to each other. Lin and I would then start a resistance from this group, and overtake hae. What Casra didn't anticipate was the power of Shinna's spy network to thwart the resistance. Thi had to build an army instead - far from the influences of Shinna, and she started by plucking you straight from under the Great Pavilion. Thi took a chance that you would be able to lead the army when the time came. So when she saw hundreds of people on the shore, and a greedy Ramne, she didn't run. She's dedicated her whole life to this plan, and now she's gambled it all on you, Kipnu."

    He stood up and faced the wall adjacent to the ladder.

    "I'm just a doctor who got here yesterday, Setre. I will do the best I can, but I really don't know what I'm doing."

    "No, Kipnu. Every person out there followed you here."

    "They didn't have a better choice."

    "They had the choice of trusting you or trusting Ram."

    He let out a sigh. "And what about our numbers? We are outnumbered ten to one."

    Setre smirked and said, "There are only a few hundred who can actually fight. And half of them are Casra's old tribemates. And besides, you have radio."

    "The listeners? The whole invisible wall thing is revolutionary, but those listeners are just toys."

    "Kipnu, have you ever considered how you could use it in a battle."

    "Well... no."

    "Of course the doctor wouldn't have. When Casra first told me about the listeners, I asked hae about whether Shinna could use them against us and thi laughed at me. But then thi realized that they could be used to deliver secrets or convey plans instantly. Messengers are used for strategy, but the listeners can be used for tactics. If you hide up in the trees surveying the Great Pavilion, your whole army can pin down the guardians and tie them up before anyone can make sense of the inevitable chaos."

    "That's brilliant, but how can I transmit from trees?"

    "You think that big tree out there is the only one Casra made? Thi and Linyu wrapped countless trees when they lived there and Linyu made a small transmitter box that can work with any of them."

    "Linyu?"

    Thi nodded and said, "I like climbing, and mom wanted to know where I was when I did."

    Kipnu smiled at him, impressed and thinking of Casra.

    He continued his questions, "Okay, so how do we even locate guardians?"

    "They all have markings like mine. Impossible to miss in the dark."

    "Seems like a major oversight. That's unlike hae."

    "The Guardians rely on fear and intimidation. The blue light is so we can see our enemies clearly while they are disoriented by flashes of light."

    "But that means you'll look just like the others."

    "I'll be elsewhere, looking for Casra."

    "Looking for hae?"

    "It's rare for us to have a prisoner - most are just drugged and then they obey. But when Casra arrived, Shinna hid hae somewhere I don't know about."

    "Where do you suppose they hid?"

    "I don't know, but there's not much around besides trees."

    "So what should we do? They could come back at any time."

    "You have radio. If they come back at a bad time, change your strategy."

    He sighed, overwhelmed with responsibility, "You make this sound easy. Maybe you should be there with us. We can find Casra together afterward."

    "It's easier than you think. If your team is in danger, call a retreat. If they've already taken the guardians down, then just tell them to hide and wait for one of us. I really need to find Casra - she could be in great danger. I'll have a listener in my ear in case things go very wrong."

    Kipnu let out a sigh but Setre didn't give him the time to doubt himself again, "Kipnu, you need to commit this map to memory. When you look down at us from the trees, and see nothing but fire and blue lights, you'll need to imagine this map imprinted in the ground so you can tell your team where to go."

    He took the lantern from Setre and studied the ground while she moved to the hay bed where Linyu was fidgeting with a box that Kipnu assumed was a transmitter. For a moment, Setre began to show a softer side, a natherly side, while Kipnu snuck glances at the two, but Linyu didn't share the same warmth that Setre had. He wondered if Setre chose to silently face her regrets or just ignore them altogether. Whichever it was, it got her this far without turning into the disgusting person Ramne had turned into.

    "How's that map?" Setre asked.

    "I think I've got it."

    "Where's the armory?"

    "Whoa we're doing a quiz? Uhh directly East of the great fire."

    "And the slaves tents?"

    "Directly east of that"

    "Where are the entrances to the Great Pavilion?"

    He smirked and said, "I knew you put those stakes in the drawing for a reason. The whole perimeter is an entrance."

    "You are ready," Setre said with a smile. "Now let's go prepare the rest of them. Linyu, go have some dinner with the group. We'll be right behind you."

    Once Linyu had left, Setre became very somber.

    "There's one more thing we haven't discussed yet."

    "Is it about Linyu?"

    "No. It's about what happened last night."

    Kipnu was listening, but felt a slight panic ensuing.

    "Kipnu, I've been thinking... what if I get pregnant from last night?"

    Setre struggled to finish the sentence, her sighs unwavering in their interruptions. His arm went to her shoulder and she lifted her own to catch it and hold it. They shared a moment that was not romantic, but placid.

    Kipnu swore to her, "Set, if it is true that you're pregnant, and if you decide to keep it. I swear to you that I will do everything to make sure our child will not just have one parent."

    Setre refused to cry, but Kipnu didn't have the same mental strength. He leaned into her and took a moment to let out all of what had happened to him as tears on her shoulder. Setre wrapped her arms around him, letting a single tear of understanding fall on his neck.

    Once Kipnu had calmed back down, Setre said to him, "Alright. let's get some dinner."

    "Yea. Let's go," he said.

    When they arrived in the circle the whole group was around the fire, already having eaten their share of fish. Lin had saved three for them, giving two to Setre and one to Kipnu. *Fair*, he thought. The group took turns introducing themselves to everyone while the two of them ate. Some had come as families bound and unbound, and some were individuals who had heard stories of Ulukoma from people they knew. The younger ones only knew that Ulukoma was a mysterious island where prisoners survived in the dark, and decided to throw their lives at it in a panic.

    Once they were done, Kipnu asked Linyu to prepare the radio transmitter. He gathered the group into a circle and divided all of the listeners amongst them, giving them first to the healthiest among them. He helped Ginnu hold it in hae tied hands and keep it on hae ear.

    "Mamen, men, women. Linyu is about to demonstrate something that will be crucial to our plan. What I've given each of you is called a listener. Casra made them here, and entrusted them to hae kaln and myself. Now, I entrust them to you. Put them up to your ears, and make sure to pass them around to the people around you."

    Kipnu sent a nod in Linyu's direction which thi confirmed and moved to the transmitter box, connecting the battery to it with well-worn wires of steel. With a clear of the throat, as hae mother had done, thi began to sing the same song that Casra had sung to Kipnu. He watched as the group slowly began to comprehend what they were hearing, their faces lighting up with awe as they looked back at Kipnu. Casra's presence was filling the air like an invisible spirit of knowledge. He looked back at Linyu who for only a moment cracked a small smile.

    Ginnu looked intently toward him without a trace of the doubt thi had before. Thi asked, "How is this possible?"

    Kipnu told her, "The wind speaks. And we listen."
