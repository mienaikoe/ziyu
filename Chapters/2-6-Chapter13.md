## Chapter 13


  Lin was silent on the walk back home. Kip was walking to him, trying to think of things to say to comfort hae, but nothing seemed appropriate for the moment.

  "Kipnu," the woman called to him.

  She was clothed in a long black robe that hadn't quite dried yet, folding her hands to keep warm on their walk to Casra's safehouse. He looked back at her, and slowed to match her pace.

  "Yes? Um.."

  "Ginnu. Ginnu um Holragi."

  "Ginnu. Ramne is your man, right?"

  "We are not bound, but I do work with him, yes."

  "And yet he left you behind?"

  She fell silent, and changed the subject.

  "I know it may seem strange, that I chose to go with you and not my partner, but I wanted to tell you that I support your efforts."

  "Is that so?" Kip asked, unconvinced. "How far are you willing to go, Ginnu um Holragi?"

  "I'll make weapons, I'll cook food, I'll fight alongside you."

  "Would you kill Ramne if it came to that?"

  She paused, not having thought of that possibility.

  "Didn't think so," said Kip. "Look, I don't trust you, Ginnu. And I think I have a good reason not to. If you're going to stick with us, you have to accept the fact that Ramne might try to protect Lissa, and die if there is a battle."

  "He wouldn't protect hae. He just likes hae for the money. Casra would find him a different job."

  "I wouldn't count on it."

  She went silent again, to process what he had just said.
