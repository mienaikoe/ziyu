## Chapter 13


  "Kipnu," the woman called to him.

  She was clothed in a long black robe that hadn't quite dried yet, folding her hands to keep warm on their walk to Casra's safehouse. He looked back at her, and slowed to match her pace.

  "Ramne is your man, right?"

  "We are not bound, but I do work with him, yes."

  "And yet he left you behind?"

  She hesitated then changed the subject, "I wanted to ask about you."

  He faced forward and kept walking, "Oh. What about?"

  "How do you know Casra?"

  "Just met hae yesterday, why?"

  "Do you know about Casra's past?"

  "Yea, thi told me"

  "I mean... the dark parts"

  "I'm not really one for gossip, uh... what was it? Your name."

  "Ginnu. Ginnu um Holragi."

  "Pleased to meet you, Ginnu."

  "Likewise," she said. And let it fade to silence.

  Kip was walking next to Linyu who had been silent and brooding since hae mother was taken. He tried thinking of things to say to comfort hae, but nothing seemed appropriate for the moment. He tried putting his hand on hae shoulder, and thi brushed it off.
