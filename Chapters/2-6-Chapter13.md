## Chapter 13

Kipnu was silent on the long walk home, following the perimeter of the island to avoid guardians. Fanla walked next to him, trying in vain to think of something to say. They were both too shocked to think clearly.

"Kipnu," a maman called to him.

It was the young maman who held back his spear with hae words, hae black robes still drenched and arms folded around hae to keep warm. He looked back at hae, and slowed to match hae pace while Fanla kept a watchful eye to the forest, searching for an opening in the canopy where that fallen tree left a gap. The maman seemed to be teetering on malnourished and hae eyes were dark and sunken.

"Yes, Um.."

"Ginnu. Ginnu um Yansha."

Thi spoke slowly, with a slurred tone.

"Ginnu. You're the one joined to Ramne?"

"We're not joined... We're... partners."

He saw a pendant around her neck, but hadn't seen one around Ramne.

"Strange for a partner to leave you behind."

Thi went silent, and changed the subject.

"I want to be rid of him."

"Is that so?" Kipnu asked, unconvinced. "How far are you willing to go to prove it?"

"I will fight with you."

"And you would kill Ramne if it came to that?"

Thi paused, not having thought of that possibility.

"Look," Kipnu said, "I don't blame you for not wanting to hurt someone you care about, Ginnu. But Ramne's not the type to care about anyone. He wouldn't hesitate to kill you if he had to. Nothing but misery follows a man like that."

"He wouldn't. I lead him to the money."

"What do you do for him?"

"I sneak into places, unlock doors, overhear secrets and... other things. I know everything about Yansha."

"Does he pay you well?"

"...none of your business."

"Sounds like he's leading you on."

"We have an arrangement. We're both happy."

"What do you think he'll do the minute someone else comes along? I've heard he betrays the people closest to him when he's found someone better."

Ginnu kept walking with hae head faced forward.

"Kipnu," thi asked, "Why do you care so much about Casra?"

"There's something about hae. In the air thi has about hae."

"Love?"

He sighed. "Not exactly. It's hard to explain."

They arrived at the fallen tree and immediately divided into work teams. Fanla and the other sea-ready people took Casra's fishing nets to the southern shore to catch fish for dinner while the rest stayed behind to build a fire. Kipnu sat watching the twigs catching fire and thinking about what sort of torture Shinna had planned for Casra. Ginnu sat beside him, keeping the distance of a stranger.

"Kipnu," thi started. "I still want to fight."

"Well, you couldn't lift a dagger the way you are now."

"There are many ways to help."

The firewood had been added, and the flame began to take hold.

"Did Casra keep any herbs?" thi asked.

Kipnu recalled the flavors in the stew he had earlier. "A few," he said.

"Show me?"

Kipnu knew to keep a watchful eye on hae, but there didn't seem to be much harm in a few spices.

"Yea, let's go," he said.

He led hae to the hole and watched as thi felt around for the ladder. Thi seemed to have some trouble placing objects in hae eyesight, but finally made it down. He began to climb in, but before he landed his foot upon the ladder he heard footsteps, light and swift in the distance.

"Stay down there. I'll handle this," he told hae.

"Kipnu, we need to talk!," Setre yelled. Most of the others ran and hid in fear, but Kipnu stood his ground, held the stolen spear firmly in one hand and calmed them with the other.

"Setre, what are you doing here?" he asked.

She stopped just short of the range of his spear.

"How could you let this happen?" she asked. Her eyes were glassy, but her face was furious.

"My only kaln..." her lips quivered.

"Setre..." there was nothing to say.

She thrust her spear into the ground with a roar of anger.

"You should be the one in that water right now. The fact that you're standing here and Linyu is dead tells me everything I need to know."

"I nearly died trying to save hae."

"But you fucking didn't!"

She took up her spear again and cut the air clean in two, landing the blade squarely between Kipnu's feet. Her breaths were labored but she wasn't done, so Kipnu took up his spear and defended himself. The bystanders dared not get anywhere near them.

"Setre, stop this."

"I won't stop until you're dead."

She swung at him hard with Kipnu blocking each blow with a great deal of effort, moving him into the dark where she had the upper hand.

"Killing me won't change what's happened."

"Maybe not. But I'll feel a whole lot better."

She backed him onto a root in the ground and he lost his footing, stumbling onto his back. All he could see was the dark of the forest and the thin blue streaks of light on her skin.

"Give me one more reason I shouldn't kill you."

"Linyu had light in hae eyes."

Setre lowered her offense. "Are you certain?" she asked. "No, you're messing with me."

Kipnu didn't know why this intrigued her so much, but he continued.

"It's true. When I dove to pull hae back up, thi had distinctive blue light in hae eyes."

Setre's eyes remained narrow, untrusting of his words, as he tried his best to recall every detail he could remember.

"What has Casra told you about the blue?" she asked him, testing if his story held weight.

"The blue?" He was puzzled by her question, but tried to remember Casra saying something about it.

"It's just a side effect of Kanosin," he said.

"Answer the question."

"Thi said thi was and addict for a long time before Linyu came around."

"What else?"

"Wait. Are you saying you think Casra drugged hae? But that's ridiculous, why would she drown hae own kaln?"

A series of thoughts went into motion in Setre's mind. Her eyes went blank, and her stance weakened to a slow pace around in a circle. Kipnu took the moment to stand back up and fetch his spear.

"Let's talk inside," she said.

"You almost killed me," he protested. "Can we talk about _that_ for a second?"

"If I wanted to kill you, I would have done that with the first stroke," she said. Her voice was so sober that he wasn't sure he was speaking to the same person. "It was cathartic just to watch you fear for your life."

She turned away from him and began walking back the way they came, ambling to Casra's old home.

"What the fuck?" he said to himself, and took off after her.

He took the ladder first, remembering that Ginnu was still below.

"Spears off!" he demanded, and she spent another moment looking for an inconspicuous place to stow her spear. Ginnu was nowhere to be found, but had left a lantern on the kitchen table, filled with fresh anomin oil that filled the air with its piney scent. He wondered where thi went, but was glad that the problem had resolved itself.

Setre had leapt from the ledge and landed on the ground of the entryway, bypassing the ladder altogether. Kipnu was hardly surprised by her acrobatic feats anymore. She looked around at the place, lamenting the silence of it all before fetching a cup from the kitchen and filling it with water from a spigot in the wall. The battle had parched his throat, and so he did the same.

Setre spoke to him over the dish cleaning basin.

"Casra has a plan that not even I understand. But what you told me out there sparked an idea in my head. Before you came along, hae plan was to secretly recruit as many of hae old followers as thi could and slowly start a resistance. What thi didn't anticipate was the power of Shinna's spy network to discover them. So thi had to scrap that idea after we spoke today. Instead, thi would have to build an army - far from the influence of Shinna. Thi was afraid that such a big battle would be dangerous for anyone on the island and that's why thi agreed to send you back home with Linyu."

"But, that all went terribly wrong," he said.

"There are things about Kanosin that even the best doctors in Palinan don't know about; things that only a kanosin addict could ever understand. And you mainlanders sent all of them here in hopes that they would never return."

"Kanosin is just a drug. There's not much to know."

"You are terribly mistaken, Kipnu. But you would dismiss me even if I told you. But if what you said is true, then it means they planned for everything to happen this way. Casra saw Ramne and knew that he would inadvertently bring more attention to hae. And thi was right. He came to the pavilion bragging about capturing Casra, and it started a chaotic mess of infighting. That was the first shot fired, but thi's counting on two more to force a bloodless surrender: a small but knowledgeable resistance within the guardians, and a much larger force made up of the strangers from the shoreline to emancipate the working class. Thi's gambled it all on me and you to finish the job."

He stood up and faced the wall adjacent to the ladder.

"I just got here yesterday, Setre. How can I lead an army?"

"No, Kipnu. Every person out there followed you here."

"They didn't have a better choice."

"They had the choice of trusting you or trusting Ramne."

He let out a sigh. "And what about our numbers? There are far too many guardians "

Setre smirked and said, "Only a few hundred guardians can actually fight. And half of them are Casra's old tribemates. Besides, we have these."

She pointed to a listener on her ear, a bit old but well taken care of.

"The listeners? The whole invisible wall thing is amazing, but isn't it just a toy."

"Have you ever considered how you could use it in a battle?"

"Well... no."

"Of course not. When Casra first told me about the listeners, I realized they could be used to deliver tactical information quickly and quietly. Messenger saffas are used for slower, more strategic information, but if you need to know where your opponent is weakest or how they're responding to you, nothing can beat a listener. People high up in the trees can see everything, and your force can administer justice - I mean... antikan - before anyone can make sense of what has happened."

"Setre, that's brilliant. But where do we get Antikan."

"The armory on the Ulu side of the central fire. Weapons above, antikan below."

"Below?"

"Hidden basement. You'll find it. One more thing: I'll be looking for Casra while you do all this."

"What do you mean?"

"Once Ramne finally gives Casra away, Shinna will mostly likely take hae somewhere nobody knows about. There's not much around besides trees but with Shinna, there's always another trick."

"What if Shinna's guardians overpower yours?"

"Let's hope your group can handle the weapons you find in the armory."

He didn't like the sound of this, but saw no better option.

"For now, let's find the listeners and head up."

They stood up from their places on the table and started their search. Kipnu took it as an opportunity to find Ginnu, and he started to search for anything he'd missed. Most of the room was filled with small things, no doors or shadows to hide in. But his eye caught sight of a seam in the wall he hadn't seen before. Its edges were smoothed down more than the rest of the clay walls that filled this place. But he dared not dig further, or rouse suspicion from Setre.

"They won't be over there," Setre said as she entered the room. "Linyu knows not to keep things near the hearth. They're probably closer to the small table near the bed."

She stepped quickly toward the table, and rummaged through a crate but found nothing.

"Strange. I would have thought they would be here."

But her eyes spotted a scratch on the floor of the crate, and she took out a dagger to pry it up. It revealed a neat pile of the wooden disks with fastened copper, nearly fifty in number.

"Linyu must have been preparing for this," he said.

"Thi can be quite productive when thi puts hae mind to it."

She picked up the crate, now mustly empty, and moved toward the ladder. But before she lifted the crate out, she paused.

"Did you hear something?" she asked.

"Hear what?" he asked, trying to maintain his composure.

She set the crate down and came back into the room, this time with a watchful eye. She took the lantern that was on the table, and held it up in front of her. Kipnu's mind raced with scenarios and contingencies as he struggled to stop her.

"It was probably a gust of wind or something."

"We're in a forest. There's no wind here."

She came across the same crack, and pulled it back slowly.

"Ginnu. I should have known."

She set the lantern down and pulled Ginnu from the carved-out niche, keeping one hand around hae wrist as thi tried to escape.

"I brought hae here, thi isn't a threat!" Kipnu plead to her, but Setre ignored him and pulled a modest length of rope from a buttoned loop on the back of her tunic and tied them behind hae back. Thi looked at Kipnu with an expression of pure fear.

"Ginnu is a spy. Thi must be silenced," she responded, struggling to keep hae still.

"Always death with you," Kipnu said, "When does it end, Setre?"

Setre led the rope down hae back and around hae ankles and then tossed her next to the ladder.

"This is too much," Kipnu said. "Ginnu's done nothing to sow distrust."

"Thi listened to our entire plan while hiding in the walls!"

"Thi was hiding from you. You were going to call for hae death however you found hae."

Ginnu didn't bother to fight; thi was looked at the ground, shaking with fear, tears in hae eyes.

"This is exactly how Shinna's spies work, Kipnu. They make you think they've changed their ways until they vanish one day and your enemies know everything about you."

He sighed and stood up, frustrated. "Look, we'll just leave hae here and come back for hae once Casra's plan is over."

"And then what? Thi lives the rest of hae life as a prisoner? As long as Kanosin exists in this world, theives like hae will do whatever it takes to keep it alive."

Ginnu finally spoke up, "I'm trying to escape this madness. Unlike you, Guardian Setre."

Setre bolted across the room and in one fluid motion, she lifted Ginnu by the shirt. Ginnu didn't flinch or fight back. Thi was like a ragdoll against the wall.

"And unlike you," she said, "I'm trying to stop it."

With a great deal of effort, Kipnu pulled her away from Ginnu.

"What's gotten into you?" he asked.

Ginnu breathed heavy and sank into the floor, but Setre had the eye of wrath upon her, and she did not pity the maman.

"This fiend could be the end of all of us."

"Let's bring hae back around the fire. We can go over the facts and decide what to do together."

"You're better off throwing hae into it," Setre said, but Kipnu took it as an agreement.

He climbed up the ladder, stopping at the top to lift Ginnu up by the shoulders. He carried hae in his arms while Setre brought the listeners. The fishing party had just returned with a enough fish and kelp for everyone, and the smell of flame-cooked food filling the air. On a soft patch of ground, he set Ginnu down at a comfortable distance away while the others stared at them in curiosity.

"Why is thi tied up?" asked a maman.

"Nothing. It's Setre."

"Tried to take a swing at her, eh?" the maman asked.

"No nothing like that. We're worried thi might run away."

"To Ramne, you mean," said a man.

He looked up at the man he was speaking to. He had the faint glow of kanosin in his eyes - one of the bound. He chose his words carefully, for fear that he was in the presence of other spies he did not know.

"Let's have dinner first, then we'll decide what to do with hae."

Fanla came to them with three fish, wrapped with kelp and cooked over the fire. She gave two to Setre and one to Kipnu. _Fair_, he thought. He broke his fish in two, and fed Ginnu the larger piece, much to Setre's disgust.

Everyone in the group took turns introducing themselves. Some had come as families, others as individuals, but all of the voluntary migrants had come only with the knowledge that Ulukoma was a mysterious island where people lived in the dark, and decided to throw their lives at it in a panic. Kipnu was amused at the irony of people migrating into the darkness to flee from another darkness. But he knew that if he were given the same situation, he would likely have reached the same conclusion.

Once they were done, Setre called for their ears.

"New Ulukomans. We have a matter to discuss - the fate of the spy Ginnu um Yansha."

Kipnu interrupted her, "And we will not suppose hae to be guilty until we can prove hae to be guilty."

"-Can we afford such luxuries in a time of crisis?"

"-And what business do we have staging a coup if we cannot aspire to do better?"

The two of them locked eyes, knowing that they had begun a crucially important debate.

"Why don't you begin, Kipnu," Setre suggested, and Kipnu begrudgingly obliged.

"Ginnu landed here today just like any of us - tossed into the water, fighting for hae life. Thi may have come with Ramne, but that is beside the point, because thi is here with us now. Hae intention is to be done with hae past life - to bury it where it stands, and to kill Ramne if it came to that. Thi's told me this haeself, as Fanla is my witness."

All eyes immediately turned to her, and she blushed with discomfort.

Setre interrupted with arguments of her own, "But consider the sorts of people that run with Ramne: drug peddlers, political informants, and yes, spies. Just like Shinna, he has his own network that runs deep into the hearts of every major city in the mainland. And it ran deep into the cracks of Casra's home, where we found Ginnu mere moments ago. We are the greatest threat to Ramne's supply of Kanosin right now. And he would do anything to stop us."

"Even if thi were spying on us - and might I remind you, that there is no evidence to prove it - Ramne would want hae back safe and sound. Ginnu is adept in skills that he could never possess - skills that make him immensely wealthy. We need to keep Ginnu in case we need to negotiate for Casra's safe return."

Setre glanced at him, as if impressed that she hadn't thought of that possibility.

She said, "Those who favor hae freedom, stand on the left. Those who favor hae captivity, please stay in the middle. And those who favor death, please stand on the right."

The crowd dispersed into a larger blob, and then began to form into amorphous groups. Many stood between the crowds, or outside of them altogether, unable to decide such an important thing in so little time. They talked amongst themselves, moving about as they changed their minds, gradually forming a more concrete set of decisions. Only Fanla abstained in the end, unwilling to decide such a thing.

Ginnu looked up to him as the crowd fell in. "Thank you," thi whispered to him through tearful eyes. If this was all an act, it was quite convincing.

"Don't look," he told hae, eyeing the few who chose death. There was a sort of fear in their eyes that was paired with guilt. They dared not look at them directly. "Nothing good can come from seeing them."

"The people have spoken in favor of captivity" said Setre, and the crowd stayed silent, walking back to their old spots to finish dinner, with a strange air of division among them.

"You heard them," said Setre, sitting down next to him, on the other side of Ginnu.

"I'll make sure thi remains tied. Leave Ginnu with me."

"Like I left Casra and Linyu with you?"

She sighed and held her head with her hand, a tinge of regret in her expression.

"Fanla should be with hae", she said. "She has warmth and strength and no bias toward either of us."

"Sure," he said. "I'll ask her in a bit."

She took a deep breath and stood up, exhaling in a sort of departure sound.

"I have to go soon. The old tribe needs my guidance."

She attached a listener she'd taken from the crate to her ear, made sure it was snug.

"Be ready to start at the fall of Ara," she said pointing to it.

"The fall of Ara?"

"Watch from the treetops. You'll know what I mean."

She set off back into the trees, and Kipnu felt a pang of sadness as she left. Despite her attacks that she insisted were not for murder, and the makeshift court they'd formed, he knew that her heart was in the right place. Perhaps a clearing of the air was needed. Now he knew where they collectively stood: a thoughtful set of people who were unwilling to rush to conclusions.

Before she vanished into the dark again, he fetched a listener from the crate and moved to a tree nearby.

"The wind speaks!" he annunciated into the coil.

He saw her blue light veer to the left and stop near a tree of her own.

"Casra sounds a lot cooler when thi says it," she replied.
