## Chapter 13


  Lin was silent on the walk home. Kip was walking next to hae, trying in vain to think of comforting things to say, but he held hae hand in the hopes that it would provide some comfort. He tried to meet the people in the group, but there were too many altogether.

  "Kipnu," the woman called to him.

  Her robe had not quite dried yet and she was folding her hands to keep warm on their walk to Casra's safehouse. He looked back at her, and slowed to match her pace.

  "Yes, Um.."

  "Ginnu. Ginnu um Holragi."

  "Ginnu. You're the one bound to Ramne?"

  "We are not bound, we're business partners."

  "And yet he left you behind?"

  She went silent, and changed the subject.

  "I know it may seem strange, that I chose to go with you and not him, but I wanted to tell you that I support your efforts."

  "Is that so?" Kip asked, unconvinced. "How far are you willing to go to prove it?"

  "I'll make weapons, I'll cook food, I'll fight alongside you."

  "And you would kill Ramne if it came to that?"

  She paused, not having thought of that possibility.

  "I didn't think so," said Kip. "Look, I don't blame you for not wanting to hurt someone you care about, Ginnu. But Ramne is not the kind of man who would hesitate to kill you if he had to. You have to distance yourself from him and anyone else who might try to protect Lissa."

  "He just likes hae for the money. He wouldn't touch me."

	"What do you do for him?"

	"I sell the goods. I know the streets of Yansha like the skin on my knees."

  "You're expendable to him. Just like Casra was when Lissa came along."

	She kept walking with her head faced forward, and a pout on her lips.

	"Kipnu," she asked, "Why do you care so much about Casra? Ram and I have met every tribe leader on this island and no one has ever mentioned your name."

	"There's something here. A key to unlock something bigger than any of us can imagine."

	"Are you high or something?"

	He sighed. "You'll understand what I mean soon."

	They arrived at the safehouse, and Kip asked Linyu to prepare the radio transmitter. He gathered the group into a circle and divided all of the listeners amongst them, giving them first to the healthiest among them.

	"Mamen, men, women. I've just given you  about to demonstrate something that will help us in our fight. What I've given you is called a listener. Casra made them here, and entrusted them to hae kaln and myself, and now I entrust them to you. Put them up to your ears, and make sure to pass them around to the people around you."

	He walked over to Linyu, who had prepared the transmitter, and thi broke hae silence for the first time since Casra was taken away.

	"Kipnu?"

	"Linyu," he said, and hugged hae. "How are you feeling?"

	"I want to fight."

	"Linyu, it's dangerous out there. Your mother would never forgive me if something happened to you."

	"But mom needs me."

	He held hae hands in his own.

	"You're right, Linyu. But there are many ways to help that don't put your life in danger." He looked at the transmitter and back at hae. "You know the radio better than anyone here. We'll need your help when the time comes, but we also need your help now. Can you show us how this works?"

	Thi affirmed and moved to the transmitter box, connecting the battery to it with well-worn wires of steel. With a clear of the throat, as hae mother had done, thi began to sing the same song that Casra had sung to Kip. He watched as the group slowly began to comprehend what they were hearing, their faces lighting up with awe as they looked back at Kipnu. Casra's presence was filling the air like an invisible spirit of knowledge. He looked back at Linyu who for only a moment cracked a small smile.

	Ginnu paced quickly toward him without a trace of the doubt she had before. She asked, "How is this possible?"

	Kip responded, "It's an invisible wall. And Casra taught us all how to knock on it."

	For dinner, some of the experienced in the group had gone to catch fish on the eastern shore while the rest stayed behind to build a fire and rest for a following shift. Kipnu sat watching the smoldering twigs and planning their approach with Linyu who knew the terrain, and an apprehensive Ginnu who knew the people. Linyu was the first to hear footsteps in the distance, nudging Kip to look toward them. It was Setre.

	"Kipnu, we need tot alk!," she screamed.

	""

	"Ginnu, hide Linyu," he said, and she took hae into the safehouse. Kip grabbed a nearby stick to defend himself with.

	Ramne had donned new luminescent flow tattoos much like the ones on Setre and had changed into reed clothing. But Kip saw that he had the same careless demeanor as he did at the shore.

	"Kipnu, you're quite the talk of the island these days," Ramne said.

	He responded, "Where is Casra?"

	Setre tried to calm them, "Quiet, the both of you. We're here to negotiate."

	Kipnu suddenly felt a twinge of distrust with Setre, but he considered that Setre might be putting on a show

	"Ginnu, can you spare a moment?" Kip called out to her as she was building the fire. She paused to join them and he continued,

	"I want to prevent any bloodshed tomorrow. Do you know of a way to "

  "Do you even know their relationship?"

  "Their hostility was pretty apparent back there."

  "He's Linyu's father."

  "Hah! You expect me to believe that? Casra was bound when thi got here."

  "Everyone here lives a second life. Even Casra."

  Linyu broke hae silence, and said, "It's true. Ram is my father."

  Kip remembered that Casra had told him about hae darker life, but he never thought thi would be with a man like that.
