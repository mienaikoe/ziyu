Kip asked Fajro to stop Lif because he thought Fajro was a good friend of Mel.
Fajro is actually an enemy, and Mel is one of the people he had a shouting match with. He wants to embarass Mel out of vengeance.
Once he realizes the gravity of the situation, and that Pinta has doomed Heiko to die first, he takes pity and reaches out to Lif with an offer.

## Chapter 5


The city was carved from the body a long-dead volcano, curled upward as if the land was an ocean wave. Massive veins of white marble meandered between gray, banded rock, striping through the roads and walls like an unmoving spectre casting shadows through time. Every building faced proudly toward Ara, carefully reflecting every glint of orange and red and infrared. High upon the mountain within the largest vein of marble sat the senate, with its crown, a the gilded halo of the Palinian circle. I imagined being one of the people that carved out their piece of the mountain to call home. *It must have taken ages*.

"Been a while, has it?" Fajro said once we got off.

"Yes. At least a few Ma'To."

"Its beauty never changes."

"Even after years of coming here?"

"Every time, it seems like a distant memory. This city changes you the minute you join the throng. Every day here is another lifetime."

"Let's make this one count."

The base of the city was brightly lit, but shaded by giant mirrors in the distance. They were used to focus Ara's light on pipes of water to deliver steam to all of Shaki. An air of bustle filled the scene with hordes of workers bringing cargo to and from trains; trade scribes in toe trying to keep up.

I helped Fajro walk from the train yard to the easternmost funicular station. It was not terribly distant, but the sluggish pace was wearing thin on the patience of passersby trying to get around us.

"I regret that I am slowing you down," he said, acknowledging his frustration.

"No such talk. These people can afford to slow down a little bit."

"You know, I used to keep pace with the trainfairers before I busted my knee."

"Oh I bet you could run circles around them," I said, trying to lift his spirits a bit.

We rode the funicular up the mountain and toward the Senate. It made several stops along the way, giving us places to stop and take in the beauty of the city from different angles. Compartmentalizing my anxiety was proving to be difficult, but I did so in order to see this beautiful site, possibly for the last time. I did it to remember.

"Senate. Last stop," called the operator.

I helped him off the funicular and he took a seat on the first bench he could find to rest his legs.

"Ah this brings me back. You see that gate? I used to walk through it every day. I would always round the left corner as I entered from the west. And the steam fountain - Oh I loved to perch on the side of that thing and rake my fingers through the cool mist."

"You sound very fond of this place."

"You could say that. Almost all of my waking life was devoted to this. It really made an impression on me."

"Do you ever miss it?"

"Some parts of it. I felt proud of myself, and all the work that we put in to make big advancements. You know, I was a crucial part of the Holragi Space Rail."

"You were a part of that?"

"Yes I was. I deployed hundreds of public works engineers to design it and find the perfect spot for it."

"You must be proud."

"Well, you Easterners usually remind us that the entire reason for going to space was to expand the observer program and that we never reached that end goal."

"But you sent a Palinian to space."

"Not all ideas make it to reality."

I nodded in affirmation.

  smooth walls cut out of a hill, the black iron gates (likely closed right now). I remember following Mel once through the gate when it was closed. Perhaps if I found an assistant... but what are the odds of that? I really didn't think this through.*

"Melna... before you say anything I–"
She took my hand and expressed a gentleness I hadn't expected, "Shh... Liffa... you did the right thing today."
I stared at her, confused, but then I saw relief in her eyes; the kind you get when a secret, having no business being so, has been lifted.
She said, "At first, I was furious. I didn't know what to think when you put the paper in front of me, but as I read it, and heard you, I realized why you came, and that everything else wasn't as important."
"Mel, you aren't..."
"Mad? No. Frustrated? Yes. It's now become difficult to negotiate for Heiko regarding this case. Pinta, a senator from Tintinal convinced the senate that we refrained from presenting our discovery so we could stockpile food and profit on the chaos. She used the letter as evidence. Now they want Heiko to distribute enough food for all Palinians to subsist on for 90 tova."
"But we only stockpile enough for 30 tova."
"I know. Heikoans would be the first to die if we did that."
"What do we do then?"
"Well, I was hoping you would help me figure that out."
My mind jumped to solutions. I had never been tasked to think about crops on such a large scale before.
"Pohua," I interjected.
"...What?"
"Pohua. It can grow under some very harsh conditions. We could surrender the food that we have stockpiled, and then quickly grow Pohua to stock up."
She pulled out a charcoal and paper.
"How long does it take to grow?"
"It grows to maturity around 40 Tova after planting."
"That's too long. What will they eat in the meantime?"
"They can do an early harvest on the crops they're currently growing. They'll likely die from inadequate light before 40 Tova anyway."
She noted down my plans and complimented me, "practical and smart. Thank you."
"What happens now?" I asked.
"Well, they are unlikely to forego sentencing. A magistrate will visit you here tomorrow with whoever wants to plea your case. Then he'll sentence you and take you to wherever that sentence sends you."
"And you'll be there, right?"
"Liffa... if I could–"
"Don't you dare sweeten it."
"The senate has a special session tomorrow about this whole fiasco. I have to be there to negotiate for Heiko. Otherwise, we'll be hung out to dry."
"I understand."
"I'll send a letter to the magistrate in the morning arguing for a lighter sentence."
"Thank you."
"Lif. If I don't see you before your sentencing. Remember that I love you. Wherever you go."
"I know."
"When you come back, I hope we will be ready."
"I hope to be ready as well."
The sound of footsteps approaching caught our ears. The slowness and slight limp made it obvious who it is.
"Fajro, is that you?" I called to him.
Mel looked at me with confused and disdainful eyes. "Fajro?! What is that lecherous milta doing here?" she asked in a hushed tone.
I was surprised that Mel had this reaction to him, and before I could explain, he rounded the corner and their eyes met.
"Fajro. Did you put Liffa up to this?"
"Absolutely not. This was her idea. I just helped her along."
"Well I hope you're happy seeing her locked up like this."
"These are dark times. We need more selfless heroes like Liffa here."
"Surely the untouchable senator would make for a better hero."
*Untouchable?*
"You don't become untouchable by making yourself vulnerable, Mel. You should know that."
I butted in, "I'm guess you two aren't friends then?"
Mel was quick to snatch the conversation, "Never."
"Oh come on Mel. That was so many Ma'to ago. I've just helped your spouse save the world. Why don't we start over."
She didn't even hesitate, "I know your game, Fajro. We're not playing it."
"Goodness. A real steeltongue you are. I actually came to deliver some good news to Liffa."
"Good for hae, or good for you?"
"Would you call skipping Ulu good for hae?"
"There are worse places than Ulu."
