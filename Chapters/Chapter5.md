Kip asked Fajro to stop Lif because he thought Fajro was a good friend of Mel.
Fajro is actually an enemy, and Mel is one of the people he had a shouting match with. He wants to embarass Mel out of vengeance.
Once he realizes the gravity of the situation, and that Pinta has doomed Heiko to die first, he takes pity and reaches out to Lif with an offer.

## Chapter 5


The city was carved from the body a long-dead volcano, curled upward as if the land was an ocean wave. Massive veins of white marble meandered between gray, banded rock, striping through the roads and walls like an unmoving spectre casting shadows through time. Every building faced proudly toward Ara and carefully reflected every glint of orange and red and infrared. High upon the mountain within the largest vein of marble sat the senate, crowned with the gilded halo of the Palinian circle. My eyes forbade belief every time I came to Shaki until I recalled the last time the dream sustained reality.
"Been a while, has it?" Fajro said once we got off.
"Yes. At least a few Ma'To."
"Its beauty never changes."
"Even after years of coming here?"
"Every time, it seems like a distant memory. This city changes you the minute you join the throng. Every day here is another lifetime."
"Let's make this one count."
I helped him walk along



  smooth walls cut out of a hill, the black iron gates (likely closed right now). I remember following Mel once through the gate when it was closed. Perhaps if I found an assistant... but what are the odds of that? I really didn't think this through.*




"Melna... before you say anything I–"
She took my hand and expressed a gentleness I hadn't expected, "Shh... Liffa... you did the right thing today."
I stared at her, confused, but then I saw relief in her eyes; the kind you get when a secret, having no business being so, has been lifted.
She said, "At first, I was furious. I didn't know what to think when you put the paper in front of me, but as I read it, and heard you, I realized why you came, and that everything else wasn't as important."
"Mel, you aren't..."
"Mad? No. Frustrated? Yes. It's now become difficult to negotiate for Heiko regarding this case. Pinta, a senator from Tintinal convinced the senate that we refrained from presenting our discovery so we could stockpile food and profit on the chaos. She used the letter as evidence. Now they want Heiko to distribute enough food for all Palinians to subsist on for 90 tova."
"But we only stockpile enough for 30 tova."
"I know. Heikoans would be the first to die if we did that."
"What do we do then?"
"Well, I was hoping you would help me figure that out."
My mind jumped to solutions. I had never been tasked to think about crops on such a large scale before.
"Pohua," I interjected.
"...What?"
"Pohua. It can grow under some very harsh conditions. We could surrender the food that we have stockpiled, and then quickly grow Pohua to stock up."
She pulled out a charcoal and paper.
"How long does it take to grow?"
"It grows to maturity around 40 Tova after planting."
"That's too long. What will they eat in the meantime?"
"They can do an early harvest on the crops they're currently growing. They'll likely die from inadequate light before 40 Tova anyway."
She noted down my plans and complimented me, "practical and smart. Thank you."
"What happens now?" I asked.
"Well, they are unlikely to forego sentencing. A magistrate will visit you here tomorrow with whoever wants to plea your case. Then he'll sentence you and take you to wherever that sentence sends you."
"And you'll be there, right?"
"Liffa... if I could–"
"Don't you dare sweeten it."
"The senate has a special session tomorrow about this whole fiasco. I have to be there to negotiate for Heiko. Otherwise, we'll be hung out to dry."
"I understand."
"I'll send a letter to the magistrate in the morning arguing for a lighter sentence."
"Thank you."
"Lif. If I don't see you before your sentencing. Remember that I love you. Wherever you go."
"I know."
"When you come back, I hope we will be ready."
