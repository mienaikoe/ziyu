## Chapter 7


*"Do you hear it"*

I paused, listening intently for the sound.

*"The tree... do you hear it?"*

I looked up at my mother's chin, illuminated by the low sun of morning, and then out to the leaves on the tree swaying in the dim light.

*"Nature speaks"*

"In the silence," I finished hae sentence.

Thi held me closer but felt cold and fragile, like oversaturated clay. Thi kept a smile on her face as thi began to disintegrate between my fingers.

*"silence,"* thi whispered, and I could no longer distinguish her voice from the wind.

"Mama, Where are you going?!" I said, bewildered.

*"silence."*

Thi sublimated and coalesced into a cloud and vanished into the tree, turning its bark an earthen orange. The breeze picked up and the song of the Ziyu sang loudly all around me as I lay grasping the roots where my mother last spoke. I listened closer to the sound; closer than before. *Is there a pattern?*

"Good Morning, Liffa."

I woke in startled moans, *am I at home?*

"Sorry Liffa, hope I didn't scare you."

*The darkness. The hard floor. Where am I?*

"I'm the magistrate for your case. They told you I would be here, no?"

It all came back to me and my heart dropped again. I sat up and brushed off my back.

"Yea. They said you would be here tomorrow morning."

"It is tomorrow morning."

*Ohh*

He continued, "I can come back once you're fully awake."

"It's probably best you don't. I would be a mess if I were awake for this."

"Suit yourself."

The magistrate carried a lantern just as yesterday. He wore charcoal gray tightly-woven robes with a white inner layer and a red waist sash of the style of Shaki legalists. His facial expression showed the experience and clarity of at least a Ma'To as an orator.

He cleared his throat, mostly as a warmup, and began in a pronounced and regal tone.

"Liffa Um Heiko, you have been charged with corruption of consciousness and interruption of the senate during its deliberation. Do you understand?"

"I do."

"As a magistrate, it is my duty to uncover the facts surrounding a matter and deliver a just punishment under the law. Do you understand?"

"I do."

"Do you submit to questioning so that Shaki may uncover these facts and root out any lies of the accused."

"I do."

He broke into a more casual tone, "So at this point, I'm just gonna ask you some questions about yesterday, and make sure they check out with what I heard from the other interviews."

I was a bit surprised, but stammered an "Okay" in my sleepy stupor. He hung the lantern up on a hook and produced a paper and charcoal.

"All right. Question one -"

"Wait.. Why are you being so nice to me? I'm a criminal."

"I find these things go smoother when I'm not judging you from my shining pedestal on high. We all do strange stuff. Whether we feel convinced it's the right thing, or a fit of passion compelled us. I'm not here to judge you personally. I'm just here to translate the law."

"Oh. That makes sense."

"So anyway, Question one. What did you barge into the senate for?"

"I had to announce some news."

"It couldn't wait until after deliberation?"

"It was highly urgent; I had to get it out before they locked themselves into a spending decision or adjourned and left for the day."

"Did the senate agree?"

"I'm not sure. I think you'll find many who did."

He finished jotting his notes and then turned the page for the next question.

"Question two. How did you come upon this news?"

"It was hand-delivered to me by our town's messenger."

"Why wasn't the messenger the one to deliver it?"

"He had to maintain the conduit in Heiko."

"And your job?"

"I'm just a farmer. I can skip a day and make it up later."

"Well, not anymore," he said under his breath, and continued.

"So why was it delivered to you?"

"It was intended for Melna, my wife."

"Melna, as in the senator?"

"Yes."

"Ah. I see."

He wrote some more notes and turned the page again.

"So that leads to question 3. How did you get into the deliberation hall in the first place?"

"I was helping a disabled ex-senator who was traveling to the senate."

"My, you certainly walk in high circles. You have a name?"

He stared at me, while I hesitated.

He said, "Come on, Liffa. I've got no intention of nabbing your friend. There's nothing illegal about an ex-senator walking the grounds."

I thought about what Mel said about him. To never trust him. Perhaps the truth would help me more than protecting him would.

"Fajro. He was a senator for Holragi."

"Fajro, eh? That explains why he was so eager to ask about you."

"He asked about me?"

"Yea, you could say that. But we'll talk about that later. You were saying?"

"Oh. Yes, I was helping him walk on account of his injured leg, and he was helping me get to the deliberation hall. He believed in the importance of the news too."

"And how exactly did he help you?"

"He distracted the guards while I... snuck in."

"Ah, that makes sense."

He finished writing and folded the paper into an inner pocket of his robe.

"Ok, I have to get all formal again, now."

He took the lantern in his hand and reassumed his regal pose. It made me nervous even though it seemed silly.

"Liffa Um Heiko, I have gathered as many facts as I could and have reached a conclusion. I find you innocent of corruption of consciousness under the codex of Palinan and absolve you of all accusations of such claim."

I felt a slight relief, but knew the other was inescapable.

"However, the codex of the senate makes clear that any interruption of any kind during deliberation is illegal. For this reason, I find you guilty of interruption of the senate during its deliberation."

The conviction was expected, but it still hurt in an aggravating way. Like a tiny worm latched to my ribcage.

"The sentence shall be a period of three La'To at the shadestead in Ulu. Do you understa-"

The door opened in a rush, and the magistrate paused to see who caused the disturbance. Two lanterns were in view.

"Fajro? What are you doing here?" the magistrate asked.

I was thinking the same thing, but I quickly changed my mind when I saw the other face.

"Kip! You came!" I shouted.

He rushed to me and reached for my face with his free hand. Fajro walked in his slower pace toward us and attempted to bow to the magistrate.

"Oh there isn't any need of that," the magistrate said.

"Pardon my old habits. They've taken a permanent residence with me." He responded.

He reached the other side of Kip and looked closely at me, trying to telegraph something but I did not know what.

"I hope we came in time to defend Liffa," he said.

The magistrate responded, "Well, it's a little bit late, but I'll permit it if you have something to say worth adding."

The magistrate turned to me and asked, "Liffa, do you approve of Fajro's testimony?"

"Only if Kip is allowed to speak as well."

"Yes, that would be fine."

The magistrate took his paper and charcoal out again and turned to Fajro, motioning for him to speak.

Fajro began, "Liffa was helping me walk. I intended to interrupt the senate myself, and unwittingly inspired hae to finish the job when I was stopped by guards."

I was aghast. He was taking the blame? For what?

The magistrate stopped writing and laid his forehead into his hand. "That's quite a thing to admit, Fajro, but Liffa was still the one who actually interrupted the deliberation."

He replied, "I understand. I hope only that you give a lighter sentence in light of my testimony."

"Well, the codex of the senate has pretty clear guidelines on sentencing for interruption. I would be risking my post if I let hae free without punishment."

Kip, turned to the magistrate and pleaded to him, "Please. Lif had every positive intention. Thi doesn't deserve to be thrown to Ulu."

Fajro chimed in, "Perhaps an alternative arrangement can be made. One that is beneficial to both Liffa and all of Palinan."

The magistrate turned to him and paused to hear more.

"If Liffa is inclined, thi could work with me in Holragi on our observational study of the obstruction."

I replied immediately, "I am not inclined."

He pushed back, "Hold on, Liffa, let me finish. You would be working with our engineers to send a spacecraft up and figure out what we're dealing with. It would take no more than a La'To, then you can head back home to Heiko."

I retorted, "And what use would a farmer be to scientists?"

"You would be a fantastic liaison between our engineers and the observers in Heiko, as you've had experience with both the Heiko messenger and their work."

He had a convincing argument, but I remembered what Mel said about him.

"I don't trust you. You could do anything with me and get away with it," I said.

"Sure, you can't trust me. But you also can't trust any of the criminals in Ulu either. If something were to harm the Heiko senator's spouse, the selfless hero-messenger, it would be awful for Holragi and our entire project. You would surely be in safe hands."

Kip added his opinion, "It does sound like a good deal, Lif. One La'To in civilization is much better than whatever you would get in Ulu."

"Three La'To," the magistrate added. "I am convinced that this would be a fitting 'punishment' and that the senate would see more use in applying you to our problems than sending you someplace where you mindlessly twiddle your thumbs in the cold. But I will give you the choice, in respect of your consciousness."

I withdrew from the door and faced the wall. I couldn't think with so many people looking at me. I had never felt so powerless before: my fate was being discussed by a room full of powerful men while I stood in a cell, forced to decide between a miserable experience and an extremely risky one. I listened to the silence and begged for a message, but couldn't hear anything but the pulse in my head and the gentle shifting of clothing behind me.
