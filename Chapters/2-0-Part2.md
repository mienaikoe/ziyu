# Part II: Kipnu

_None shall terminate the flow of the conscious mind_

&nbsp;

_whether their own or another's;_

_whether temporarily or permanently;_

_whether directly or indirectly;_

_whether by force or by accident;_

&nbsp;

_Consciousness is the sacred gift of life._

_To manipulate it is to act contrary to the spirit._

_To squander it is to defy the will of nature._

_To destroy it is to destroy oneself._

&nbsp;
