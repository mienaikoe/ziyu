# Part II: Kipnu

_None shall terminate the flow of consciousness_

_whether their own or another's;_
_whether temporarily or permanently;_
_whether directly or indirectly;_
_whether by force or by accident;_

_Consciousness is the sacred gift of life._
_To manipulate it is to act contrary to the spirit._
_To squander it is to defy the will of the universe._
_To destroy it is to destroy oneself._

- The Code of Consciousness, Philosopher Lanre um Shaki, 17,528th Day after the Fifth Cold
