# Part II: Kipnu

_None shall terminate the flow of the conscious mind;_

&nbsp;

_neither for one's own mind nor that of another,_

_neither with intention nor by a failure to act,_

_neither directly nor inductively,_

_neither by word nor by injury._

&nbsp;

_Consciousness is the sacred gift of life._

_To manipulate it is to be contrary to the spirit._

_To squander it is to defy the will of nature._

_To destroy it is to destroy oneself._

&nbsp;
