## Chapter 6

There was a constant reverberant murmur that filled the hall as a fidelant was talking about her city's proposal for a new academy of arts. I was between two elevated seating areas, so I was hidden from the view of most senators. A few senators glanced at me for a second and returned their view as if nothing had happened. I stopped to notice a faint glow from the walls on the left that got brighter as it grew to become the ceiling. _Thin. The ceiling is thin so it lets in light and isn't heavy._
I was on the Heiko side of the hall so I figured Melna would be somewhere close by. The hall was constructed so that senators would start at the center before going further up to their desks. I would have to do the same, probably bringing a decent amount of attention to myself in the process. Luckily the center area was large so I might get away with it if I stayed quiet and slow. I hesitated, then proceeded with quiet steps along the side of the entryway, keeping my head slightly down. My anxiety rushed in more with every step toward the center of the hall, but I kept my stride by counting my steps. Right as I entered the center area, I turned to the left and kept walking to make it look like I knew where I was going. _The speaker is continuing. Good._ There were steps going upward immediately to my left, so I took them and raised my gaze to look for Melna. I couldn't find her to my right, but I saw the back of her head in the front row on the other side of the entryway. _I chose the wrong side._ I could feel the eyes of the senators locked on me now, and I was drawing attention. I would have to go back to the center again. I would really draw attention then. My pounding heart and ringing ears were deafening and I was picking up my pace to get to Melna as quickly as possible.

"Are you lost?" A different voice interrupted the speaker and addressed me directly. _That must be the mediator._

Every eye turned to me. I turned to Melna and her mouth was agape in disbelief. I had to say something.

"I.. I've come with important news from observers in -"

"It is illegal to interrupt the senate."

"Yes, I know, but -"

"You are in corruption of the Senate. You do not belong here. Leave or you will be forced to leave."

_The mediator was shutting me up, as expected. But I was too far from Melna to get her help._

"Please, allow hae to speak" A familiar voice boomed through the microphone. It was Melna but I had never heard her voice so loudly before.

"On what grounds?!" The mediator challenged her.

"I can vouch for whatever Liffa has to say. Thi comes from Heiko with important news."

"This is ridiculous. The senate cannot be interrupted."

"Mediator, if I may, the speaker from Pikshi was interrupted by your interjection, not by Liffa's footsteps."

The room began to rumble as the mediator paused in shock. I took the pause to move to Melna as quickly as possible.

"Not another step!" The mediator called to me, but I continued.

Melna walked out to receive me with a scowl on her face.

"What are you doing here?!" She whispered loudly.

I stayed silent but showed with my face that I knew what I was doing and needed her trust. She stepped aside and led me to the seat in her aisle with a microphone while she went to her old seat next to it. I dug through my bag and lifted the paper message out, setting it on the desk in front of me. The mediator's anger was apparent, but no one else seemed to be so outraged - just surprised and confused.

As I was preparing what I would say, the door I entered through suddenly opened in a loud thud, and the two guards I had snuck behind entered.

"Pardon us, mediator. An intruder is suspected to be here. Have you seen hae?"

The mediator simply pointed, and the guards began walking toward me. I had to speak now.

"There is a growing object in space obstructing Ara. We have 90 days before it goes dark. We must-"

The senate was in an uproar as Tinpo and Padji came closer to me. Melna yelled, "Stop!" at them, but they ignored her commands. Tinpo grabbed my arms with a the tightest grip I had felt before and thrust me out of my chair and into the walkway. I screamed, "No!" and reached for the paper, but he was stronger than me. Melna quickly grabbed the paper and chased after me. She gripped my hand and said, "Don't worry, I will read your message. I'll come for you after we adjourn." Padji turned around and held Melna back as gently as she could. My last view of the senate was of Melna, in her robes, standing strong as always, with the message grasped firmly in her hand.

My cell was dark and dusty. I was tempted several times to lay down on the dusty floor, but I talked myself out of it each time. The tiniest sounds became loud enough to startle me: a short breeze through the window outside, a beetle stumbling on a rock, even the racing thoughts in my mind made an audible buzz. I was prepared for Ulukoma, but not for the gnawing anxiety and guilt I felt sitting in a cell alone. I wondered in an almost-prayer if the Senate would believe Melna. If they would ridicule her for allowing her jund to break into the Senate and address everyone. And where was Fajro? How did he think this would work? He couldn't have stood there distracting them forever.

A door opened in the next room, waking me from the droning trance of my cell. I heard a female voice start to talk to the watchman. I listened intently through the wall and I thought I heard Melna's voice, but couldn't be sure. They moved to the inner door which opened with a mechanical clink, and footsteps began to ring off the gray stone walls. I stood up to watch them by the lanterns they held to the shadow.

"Liffa, you have a visitor," the watchman said.

I kept looking until their faces came into view. It was Melna.

"Melna... before you say anything I–"

She took my hand and expressed a gentleness I hadn't expected, "Shh... Liffa... you did the right thing today."

The watchman left us to return to his post. I stared at her, confused, but then I saw relief in her eyes; the kind you get when a secret, having no business being so, has been lifted.

She said, "When I saw you here, I was furious. But when you mentioned the observeratory, I realized that you must have come for a good reason, and that everything else we were talking about was not as important. I read the message to the senate and I told them I had been talking with the observers. Some of them believe me, some of them don't."

"Melna, you aren't..."

"Mad? No. I'm just frustrated at the situation now. Your presence has swayed the course of the senate. It's become difficult to negotiate for Heiko. A fidelant from Tintinal accused me of keeping it a secret so we could stockpile and profit on the chaos. Now they want Heiko to distribute enough food for all Throngia to subsist on for 30 days."

"But we only stockpile enough for ourselves for 60 days."

"I know. But we must do this if we are to maintain our position in the senate. We will focus on rebuilding our grain reserves in the steppe."

"And what if the obscura decides to disperse one day while we're stuck out there? We'll all be burned alive."

"And we will have starved to death long before that if we don't."

You can't let them push us around like that!"

"Liffa... It's not that easy."

"Just tell them no!"

"It would risk a war at a time when none of us can afford that."

I pounded on the bars and paced back into my cell. Frustrated would be an understatement.

"These are the people who protect our civilization from destroying each other? A bunch of people playing games with every Throngian to see what they can get?"

"Liffa... It's complicated."

I paced again, my cell feeling smaller than it had before. I didn't let her see that I was fighting countless compulsions to rattle the bars and scream at the top of my lungs. But my mind gave up and pushed me deeper into a depressive mess.

"So... what happens to me now?" I asked in a cracked voice.

"Well, they are unlikely to forego sentencing. A magistrate will visit you tomorrow with whoever wants to plea your case. Then he'll sentence you and take you to wherever that sentence sends you."

"And you'll be there, right?"

"Liffa... if I could–"

"Don't you dare sweeten it."

She sighed and glanced to the side. "The senate has a special session tomorrow about the obstruction. I have to be there to negotiate for Heiko. Otherwise, we'll be hung out to dry."

"I understand," I said, taking a step back.

"I'll get Kipnu to come. And I'll send a letter to the magistrate in the morning arguing for a lighter sentence."

"Thank you."

"Liffa. If I don't see you before you leave. Remember that I love you. Wherever you go."

I hadn't thought of that possibility. "I know, Melna. I know."

"All of us are responsible for each other. I want it to feel like home as much as possible when you do come back."

"And I promise to bring my whole self back as well."

"You had better, Liffa."

The door opened again and the sound of broken footsteps caught our ears. They were slow, and intimated a slight limp that made his presence obvious.

"Fajro, what are you doing here?" I called to him.

Melna looked at me with confused and disdainful eyes. "Fajro?! What is that lecherous milta doing here?" she asked in a hushed tone.

I was surprised that Melna had this reaction to him, and before I could explain, he rounded the corner and their eyes met.

"Did you put Liffa up to this?" she asked.

"Absolutely not. This was Liffa's idea."

"I apologize if I seem doubtful, but this is not the sort of idea thi would think of."

"Melna, these are dark times. Thi knows it. Now we all know it. We need more selfless heroes like hae who transcend the law and the bureacracy to do what cannot wait."

"Surely the untouchable ex-fidelant would make for a better hero."

_Untouchable?_

He scoffed. "You don't become untouchable by bringing attention to yourself, Melna. You know that."

I butted in, "I'm guessing you two have met?"

Melna was quick to snatch the response, "Regrettably, yes."

"Melna, surely you're joking. Let our squabbles stay in the past where they belong."

"I know your game, Fajro." She didn't hesitate. "We're not playing it."

Fajro leaned back with a serious face now, "Melna, we can agree to disagree, but we will get nowhere pointing fingers at each other. The fact of the matter is that we are now in a battle for our lives against an unknown enemy. We must do everything that we can to come together, understand this threat, and fight it back as quickly as we can."

Melna paused to let his words die in the corners of the room.

"You have no business being here," she said. "This decision is between me and Liffa, so I'll ask you once nicely to leave."

"You're being ridiculous Melna, I only–"

"Get out."

He stared at her for a moment, with the same unfazed and perceptive look he always had, and then slowly turned around, slinging a glance my way.

"We'll talk later," he said to me.

Melna turned back to me, and said, "Another lie."

When he had finally closed the door on his way out, Melna came in closer to me and asked me under her breath, "How did you meet Fajro?"

"I met him on the train here. I couldn't have done this without his help."

"Of course. Listen to me, Liffa, that man will do anything it takes to force his will and gain power. He tricked the entire senate into a bad trade deal. Heiko and Shaki were stuck donating food and freshwater to some shady mining project in exchange for a rail network. Then when he retired, it was clear that his company used our resources as leverage against the tribes of Holrag just to make his stupid space rail."

"I didn't know..." I said.

"Fajro is a conniving, manipulative bastard. Do not listen to anything he says."

"But then why would he help me?"

"To embarrass me and lower my status in the Senate. Or perhaps there's some other angle, but whatever it is you stay away from whatever he's offering, no matter how good he makes it sound. Do you understand?"

"I understand."

Her free hand was holding hard on my shoulder now, and she saw that I was uncomfortable, so she slowly rose her head again and calmed down.

"Good," she said. "I'm sorry I can't be at your hearing tomorrow. I'll send a message to Kipnu to see if he can come instead. Meanwhile you should get some rest."

I felt scared and alone again. "Where are you going?"

"I'm sorry. I have to prepare for tomorrow's session."

"Stay with me. Just for one more minute."

She looked at me for a bit, then hung her lantern on a cell bar and held me through the bars. They smelled like piss and felt like rust, but I didnt mind. I chose this woman and she chose me.

"I love you, Liffa. Kipnu would say it too if he were here."

"I know. You're here."

I lifted my head and gazed at her through the bars.

"I love you too."

She smiled, lost in the moment as well.

"I know."
