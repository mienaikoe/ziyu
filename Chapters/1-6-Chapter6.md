## Chapter 6

There was a constant reverberant murmur that filled the hall as a fidelant spoke to them - something about her province's proposal for a new academy of arts. I was nestled in a walkway between two elevated seating areas, so I was hidden from the view of most fidelants. A few at the opposite end of the hall glanced at me for a second, then returned their view as if nothing had happened.

As I ventured further, I noticed a faint glow from a wall to the left, where Ara shone through the entryway and onto this giant orb. A precise map of the world appeared in shades on the wall with an inverse orientation, as if looking down from the sky. I observed and inferred more and more and finally mapped out a route. Typically, people would enter from these walkways into the center before going further up to their desks, and luckily I was on the eastern portion of the hall, so I assumed that Melna sat nearby. I would still have to walk into that center circle, probably bringing a decent amount of attention to myself in the process, but it was large so I might get away with it if I stayed quiet and slow.

I hesitated, then proceeded with quiet steps along the side of the entryway, keeping my head slightly down. With every step toward the center of the hall, my hearts rushed with anxiety, but I counted my steps to remain calm. Once I entered the center area, I picked a side – _left_ – and immediately rounded the marble wall and started walking up the steps to make it look like I knew where I was going. _The speaker isn't stopping. I'm almost in the clear._ About halfway up, I lowered myself and raised my gaze to look for Melna. She didn't appear to me immediately, but then I spotted the side of her face in the front row on the opposite side of the entryway. _I chose the wrong side._ I picked up my pace to get to Melna as quickly as possible.

"Are you lost?" A different voice interrupted the speaker and addressed me directly. Her voice sounded so close that it felt as if it were coming from the inside of my head.

The eyes of the fidelants were locked upon me now, shocked at my mere presence. My pounding hearts and ringing ears were deafening. I looked toward the center of the room where a lantern illuminated the face of a scornful woman. She looked back at me, emotionless, cold, intolerant. I had to say something.

"I.. I've come with important news from observers in–"

"It is illegal to interrupt the senate."

"Yes, I know, but I–"

"You are in corruption of the Senate. You do not belong here. Leave or you will be forced to leave."

_The mediator was shutting me up, as expected. But I was too far from Melna to get her help._

"Your piety, if I may," Melna's voice boomed through the hall and commanded the attention of all in the room. "Please allow hae to speak."

But the mediator was not convinced. "On what grounds?" she challenged.

"I can vouch for whatever thi has to say. Liffa comes from Heiko with important news."

A murmur filled the room, followed by a raised hand of the mediator for all to remain quiet.

"Did you plan for this interruption, Melna?"

"Of course not, your piety. But some news is too–"

"Nothing. Shall. Interrupt. This. Council!"

"Your piety, if I may," called another from the far end of the room. "The speaker from Pikshi was interrupted by your interjection, not by this maman's movements."

The room began to rumble as the mediator paused in shock. I took the pause to move to Melna as quickly as possible.

"Not another step!" The mediator called to me, but I continued.

Melna walked out from her desk to receive me, and cast me a scowl of disappointment.

"What are you doing here?!" She whispered loudly.

I stayed silent but showed with my face that I knew what I was doing and needed her trust. With much trepidation, she stepped aside for me to walk down the desk aisle to her seat while she sat beside me. I spared no time digging through my bag for the paper message and set it on the desk in front of me. The mediator's anger was apparent, but no one else seemed to be outraged – just surprised and confused.

As I was preparing to speak, the door I entered through suddenly opened in a loud thud, and the two guards I had snuck behind entered.

"Pardon us, mediator. An intruder is suspected to be here. Have you seen hae?"

The mediator simply pointed, and the guards began walking toward me. I had to speak now before the guards arrived.

"There is a growing object in space obstructing Ara. We have five days before it goes dark. We must-"

The senate was in an uproar as Tinpo and Padji came closer to me. Melna yelled, "Stop!" at them, but they ignored her commands. Tinpo grabbed my arms behind me and locked them with the tightest grip I had felt before, and he thrust me out of my chair and into the walkway. "No!" I screamed and wrested one of my hands free. I reached for the paper, but his hand came quickly down upon mine and locked it in twice as hard. Melna quickly grabbed the paper and chased after me. She said, "I'll finish your message, Liffa. And I'll find you after we adjourn." Padji turned around and held Melna back as gently as she could. My last view of the senate was of Melna, in her robes, standing strong as always, with that small paper slip grasped firmly in her hand.

The holding area was dark save for a lantern on a distant wall. The tiniest sounds became loud enough to startle me: a short breeze through the window outside, the family of miltas scurrying about in search of food. Even the racing thoughts in my mind made a cacophonous buzz. I was tempted several times to lie on the dusty floor, but I knew that I wouldn't be able to bathe for a long time.

I had prepared myself for Ulukoma, but not for the gnawing anxiety of sitting in a cell alone. The time was strewn together like a trance or a prayer, and I wondered if this silent time was meant to break the prisoner's perception of right and wrong before they were even spoken to. I wondered if the Senate would believe Melna. If they would ridicule her for allowing her jund to break into the Senate and say such ridiculous things. And where was the man who helped me? My accomplice? How did he think this would work? He couldn't have stood there distracting them forever.

A door opened in the next room, waking me from the drone of the cell. I heard a female voice start to talk to the watchman and I listened intently through the wall. It might have been Melna's voice, but I couldn't be sure. The voices moved to the inner door which opened with a mechanical clink, and footsteps began to ring off the gray stone walls. I stood up to see their faces, glowing by the lanterns they held to see me.

"Liffa, you have a visitor," the watchman said.

I kept looking until their faces came into view. It was Melna after all.

I held a hand through the only gap in the wall and I plead to her, "Melna... before you say anything I–"

"Shh...," She took my hands and calmed me with her gentle voice, "Liffa... you did the right thing today."

The watchman left us to return to his post. I stared at her, confused, but then I looked into her eyes. There was a sort of relief there: the kind you get when a great weight of anguish has been liberated from the spirit.

She said, "When I saw you here, I was furious. But when you mentioned the observatory, I realized that you must have been sent by Thimlu and that everything else the senate was deliberating was irrelevant. I read the message to the senate and I told them I had been talking with the observers. Some of them believed me, but others did not."

"Melna, you aren't..."

"Angry at you? No. I'm angry at the senate. The message has swayed its course and it's become difficult to negotiate for Heiko. A fidelant from Holrag accused me of keeping all of this a secret so we could stockpile and profit on the chaos. Now they want Heiko to distribute enough food for all of Palinan to subsist on for 20 days."

"But we only stockpile enough for ourselves for 60 days. And what about their own stockpiles?"

"I know. But we must do this if we are to maintain our position in the senate. We will focus on rebuilding our grain reserves in the steppe."

"The steppe?" I scoffed. "Melna, you can't grow anything out there it's too hot."

"Things will begin to cool quickly. We can no longer grow in the same places. We must keep up with the obscura and move to warmer places."

"And what if the obscura decides to disperse one day while we're stuck out there?"

"We will have starved to death long before that if we don't start growing there."

"No! You can't let them push us around like this!"

"It's not that easy."

"Just refuse their demand!"

"It would risk a war at a time when we can't afford that."

I pounded on the walls and I retreated back into my cell, my arms throbbing from the pain I'd just caused them. Through the ringing in my ears, I heard the heavy beating of my hearts counting each moment as it passed in the depths of this wretched city.

"This senate... These are the people who protect our civilization from destroying each other? A bunch of angry men and women making bets with their people?"

"Liffa... It's complicated."

I paced again. This cell seemed smaller than it was before. I didn't let her see that I was fighting countless compulsions to rattle the door and scream at the top of my lungs. But my mind gave up and pushed me deeper into a depressive mess.

"So... what happens to me now?" I asked in a cracked voice.

"Well, they are unlikely to forego sentencing. A magistrate will visit you tomorrow with whoever wants to plea your case. Then he'll sentence you and take you to wherever that sentence sends you."

"And you'll be there, right?"

"Liffa... if I could–"

"Don't you dare twist your words on me."

She sighed and glanced to the side. "The senate has a special session tomorrow about the obscura. I have to be there to negotiate for Heiko. Otherwise, we'll be hung out to dry."

I took a step back and sighed. "I understand," I said.

"I'll get Kipnu to come. And I'll send a letter to the magistrate in the morning arguing for a lighter sentence."

"Thank you."

"Liffa. If I don't see you before you leave. Remember that I love you. Wherever you go."

I hadn't considered that this might be the last time I see her for a while. "I know your love. I know."

"The three of us are responsible for each other," she said. "I'll be fighting for home to feel like home. So you'll have something to look forward to when you come back."

"And I promise to bring my whole self back as well."

"Promise me, Liffa–"

The door opened again and the sound of broken footsteps caught our ears. They were slow, and intimated a slight limp that made his presence obvious.

"Fajro, what are you doing here?" I called to him.

Melna looked at me with confused and disdainful eyes. "Fajro?! What is that lecherous milta doing here?" she asked in a hushed tone.

I was surprised at Melna's reaction. Before I could explain, he rounded the corner and their eyes met.

"Did you put Liffa up to this?" she asked.

"Absolutely not. This was Liffa's idea."

"My apologies if I seem doubtful, but this is not the sort of idea thi would think of."

"Melna, these are dark times. Thi knows it. Now we all know it. We need more selfless heroes like hae who transcend the law and the bureacracy to do the things that we cannot wait for."

"Surely the untouchable ex-fidelant would make for a better hero."

_Untouchable?_

He scoffed. "You don't become untouchable by bringing attention to yourself, Melna. You know that."

I butted in, "I'm guessing you two have met?"

Melna was quick to snatch the response, "Regrettably, yes."

"Surely you're joking, Melna. Let our squabbles stay in the past where they belong."

"I know your game, Fajro." She didn't hesitate. "We're not playing it."

Fajro leaned back with a serious face now, "We can agree to disagree, but we will get nowhere pointing fingers at each other. The fact of the matter is that we are now in a battle for our lives against an unknown enemy. We must do everything that we can to come together, understand this threat, and fight it back as quickly as we can."

Melna paused to let his words die in the corners of the room.

"You have no business being here," she said. "This decision is between me and Liffa, so I'll ask you once nicely to leave."

"You're being ridiculous Melna, I only–"

"Get out."

He stared at her for a moment, with the same unfazed and perceptive look he always had, and then slowly turned around, slinging a glance my way.

"We'll talk later," he said to me.

Melna turned back to me, and said, "Another lie."

When he had finally closed the door on his way out, Melna came in closer to me and asked me under her breath, "How did you meet Fajro?"

"I met him on the train here. I couldn't have done this without his help."

"Of course. Listen to me, Liffa, that man will do anything it takes to force his will and gain power. He tricked the entire senate into a bad trade deal back when I was a junior fidelant. Heiko and Shaki were stuck donating food and freshwater to some shady mining project in exchange for a rail network. Then when he retired, it was clear that his company used our resources as leverage against the tribes of Holrag just to make his stupid space rail."

"I didn't know..." I said.

"Fajro's words may be sweet, but he is a conniving, manipulative bastard. Do not listen to anything he says."

"But then why would he help me?"

"To embarrass me and lower my status in the Senate. Or perhaps he's working some other angle with the senate. Whatever it is you stay away from whatever he's offering, no matter how good he makes it sound. Do you understand?"

"I understand."

Her free hand was holding hard on my shoulder now, and she saw that I was uncomfortable, so she slowly rose her head again and calmed down.

"Good," she said. "I'm sorry I can't be at your hearing tomorrow. I'll send a message to Kipnu to see if he can come instead. Meanwhile you should get some rest."

I felt scared and alone again. "Where are you going?"

"I'm sorry. I have to prepare for tomorrow's session."

"Stay with me. Just for one more minute."

She looked at me for a bit, then hung her lantern on a hook in the wall and held my hand through the hole. This place smelled like piss and rust, but I didn't mind. I chose this woman and she chose me.

"I love you, Liffa. Kipnu would say it too if he were here."

"I know. You're here."

I lifted my head and gazed at her through the hole in the wall.

"I love you too."
