## Chapter 6

Nestled in a walkway between two elevated seating areas, I stood in the shadows, observing all that took place in that grand hall. There was a constant reverberant murmur that filled the hall as a fidelant spoke. I would have thought the speaker was Melna if not for her Shakii dialect and the distinct lack of conviction in her voice. Perhaps that conviction was what Fajro was referring to when he mentioned the spice in Melna's words.

To my right was a faint glow, where the mirrors outside had been focusing their light. The senate insignia appeared again upon that wall, in hills and grooves of thicker and thinner marble that played with the light. I took a step forward to see more but I stopped as a pair of eyes at the opposite end of the hall glanced in my direction. The man perused the walkway with his eyes while I dared not move, certain that movement would give me away before a sight of my face at that distant. After a moment he returned his eyes to the speaker as if he'd seen nothing. I would have to find a more subtle way to approach.

I presumed that Melna sat nearby, as the Heiko division of the senate was behind me as I'd come through the door. I looked for the fidelants among all of the attendants I could see: the scriveners in their loose brown robes, the judges in well-cut deep black kelp, and the horde of bureacrats in undyed white famba that faded into the marble. The fidelants were unlike the others in their colorful robes, sitting closest to the center. I surmised that Melna would be sitting in that inner circle, at the end of this walkway and that I would have to enter that circle myself, attracting all of the senate's attention.

I mustered some strength, then proceeded with quiet steps along the side of the walkway, keeping my head low and my eyes forward. My hearts rushed with anxiety as I counted every step toward the center of the hall. I could see some people beginning to focus on me one-by-one, but the speaker didn't stop, so I wasn't about to either. Once I'd cleared the marble wall I immediately rounded it and looked for Melna, but all that I saw was an empty seat. I looked up toward the speaker, who had begun to take on more of her traits until my eyes finally accepted that Melna was the one who was speaking. I'd misheard my own bundwoman, and now I was thirty paces further than I needed to be.

"Are you lost?" A different woman interrupted Melna and addressed me directly, sounding as if it were coming from the inside of my own head. Every gaze was locked upon me now, and my pounding hearts and ringing ears were deafening. I looked toward the brighter side of the room where a lantern illuminated the face of a scornful woman. She looked back at me, emotionless, cold, intolerant.

I struggled to begin, "I... I've come with important news from–"

"Your mere presence corrupts the senate," she said, her voice overpowering mine with ease. "Leave or you will be forced to leave."

I glanced at Melna, wondering if I could reach her before someone stopped me, But she spoke before I could do it.

"Your piety, mediator Tamna, if I may," Melna's voice boomed through the hall and commanded the attention of all in the room. "Please allow hae to speak."

But the mediator was not convinced. "You're risking corruption by lending your voice to this maman," she challenged.

"I assume responsibility for whatever thi has to say," said Melna with a calm voice. "Liffa comes from Heiko with important news for all of us to hear."

A murmur filled the room with whispers and muffled conversation, but the mediator raised her hand and the room went quiet again.

"Why couldn't you announce this news yourself?" Tamna questioned Melna. "Am I to believe you were so unprepared that you had a... maman... enter the senate illegally to deliver a message?"

"Your piety," said Melna calmly. "The matter is not of preparedness but of timing. Liffa's presence here speaks to the importance of–"

"Nothing is more important than the law!" Her voiced boomed and reverberated off of every wall and took its time to settle back into silence.

An older judge from across the room stood up and cleared his throat. "Your piety, if I may... The senate was interrupted by your interjection, not by this maman's walking. Let hae deliver the message. The guards and magistrates can handle the rest."

The room began to rumble with voices as the mediator paused in shock. I took the distraction to move to Melna as quickly as possible. "Not another step!" The mediator roared at me, but I continued in spite of her command.

Melna stepped down from the speaking pedastal and cast me a scowl of disappointment. "What are you doing here?!" She whispered with a strained air.

The words that came to my mind were inadequate to explain but the determined look on my face showed to her that I needed her trust. With cold shaking hands, I dug through my bag for the paper message and set it into her hand. She opened it up and perused the drawings before beginning to read. She neared the end and raised her eyes from the paper to stop herself from reading. With her face flushed red, she looked out at the the senate thrown into chaos and for the first time I saw a look on her face I had never seen before. For the first time since I had known her, she was uncertain. It was an expression I'd have preferred never to have seen on the woman I loved, but I was proud to be with her in this moment, to hold her hand, to give her something that she could be sure of.

From the corner of my eye I noticed the door that I'd come through suddenly open, and the two heavily-clad guards I had snuck past entered the senate.

Padji, the one who was not Fajro's nephew walked to the center of the room and looked around. "Fidelants, judges, and renowned mediator," she said. "We apologize for the interruption, but we suspect that an intruder has infiltrated the senate. Has anyone seen a maman walking about?"

The mediator pointed at me with a smug grin on her face, and the senate erupted in a clamor. I felt the room getting bigger, and me getting smaller, fading into the dark wall behind me.

"Stop!" Melna yelled at the guards. "Thi is here at my request!" But they ignored her command.

Tinpo grabbed my arms and twisted me around, locking them behind me with a grip that was just shy of breaking my wrists. With a sharp thrust, he pulled me off of the wall and back into the empty center. Melna was walking at my side arguing for my freedom, her words filled to the brim with the fire I remembered. I wrested one of my hands free to reach for hers, but Tinpo's arm came quickly down upon mine and pinned it against my body.

"I will tell them what you came here to say," she said. "And I'll come find you after we adjourn." Padji turned around and held Melna back as gently as she could.

As we went through the door, I looked over my shoulder and told her that I loved her, or at least I believe that I did. But I'll always remember what she looked like in that moment, with her face full of determination and a small paper slip grasped firmly in her hand.
