## Chapter 8

The creaky wooden ship to Ulukoma looked like it was made by a generation no longer living. It was patched up with scrap boards and rusted nails that were raised from the boards they were meant to hold tightly to the beams below. Despite its mostly ramshackle shape the ship cut swiftly through the water under the power of an electric motor that hummed and rattled every plank and nail on the deck they stood upon. Kipnu was used to saffas and trains, not this ever-rocking monstrosity, but he took solace in knowing they would arrive shortly. He might have believed that he deserved to be on that ship if he thought about it long enough.

The captain was a tall, muscular woman by the name of Nanta, or at least that's what he overheard the Shaki guard call her when he was taken aboard. The rest of the crew were rather unkempt men and women with stippled faces and miserable expressions. The ship's "cargo" – as the crew called them – was a handful exiles like him, their hands all bound with rope in front of them as they sat down in a line on the right side of the deck. Kipnu observed their expressions, watched all of them staring blankly into their own minds. Some were afraid and others were simply resigned. And others had the blue haze in their eyes: a sign of kanosin withdrawal. He hadn't seen many cases, but Kipnu knew it when he saw it.

One peculiar guest caught his eye: a kaln with unbound hands (or was thi still a fully grown maman? He wondered if he wasn't the only one confused about hae age). Thi was standing at the bow, dressed in thick black kelp and peering out on the dark horizon. Thi was too young to work the ship, much less be made a prisoner of Ulukoma. What thi was doing there, Kipnu couldn't be sure, but he knew that something was off about hae. It felt as if no one else on the ship could see hae except for him.

The land behind them had disappeared by the time he noticed a dark silhouette before them: an island full of tall trees and nothing visible save for the sand along the shoreline illuminated by the reddish hue of Ara low on the horizon. The dusk of the sky made everything feel like evening, but Kipnu knew that the day was still at its peak.

"Ballast!" called the captain, and all the crew rushed to the left side of the ship to wrap their wrists in bit of rope they'd prepared. Kipnu felt the ship begin to tilt to the right. "Turn!" cried the captain again as she pulled a steel lever on her left. The ship lurched violently to the left and began to roll onto its side. The others tried desperately to hold onto the railing, onto each other, but their hands were in no position to catch anything. One by one, they began to fall into the water as the ship continued to tip further and further. Kipnu tried to jam two fingers into a niche he'd found in the deck, but the gap was too small for his fingers to find a solid place to grasp. A large wave bared its breast before them and bore the weight of the ship on its back, creaking the deck beneath them. Kipnu knew the crash would wrest the last of his strength so with his last moments there he looked up at the captain as she smirked back at him and he vowed never to forget her face. With a boom the ship hit the water and his fingers released their grip on the deck. For a moment he was helpless, hanging in the air with nowhere to go but down. But as down is the most insistent of directions, his body met with the dark ocean below him.

The cold water pierced his skin and covered his whole body with a feeling of needles.The shock disoriented him, scattered his sense of direction across the waves, but he remembered to hold his breath and let it come to him. Bubbles of air began trickling and fluttering across his face from his right cheek to the left. _Floating up_, he thought. And with a sequence of kicks and jerking motions, he set his head upright and found the surface.

Kipnu breathed in the cool air and warmed his face with his exhales. He looked around and saw a sea of terrified faces struggling to stay afloat.

"On your back!" A voice called over the water. "Use your feet!". It was the strange kaln from the bow, treading on the waves and giving directions. Kipnu wanted to help but he knew that the kaln was in a far better place to do that - he had to focus on keeping himself afloat. "This way!" the kaln called to them again from further away. Thi was leading them to the shore.

The cold in his skin turned to a dull pain as Kipnu fought to keep his head above the water and follow the kaln's voice. The waves were small but unrelentless, as if they would pull him out to sea if he didn't stop pushing. But he trusted his mind; he'd trained himself to think clearly in situations like this. His resolve to live and the rousing voice of a kaln were all he needed to stay alive.

<!-- In medical training he was taught to repeat a phrase to keep himself calm; _Apathy kills. Agility cures._ -->

"Where the waves begin to break, you can stand," said the kaln. Thi was waiting on the shallows, pulling people out of the water. "If you still have strength, come to me."

With his toes pointing toward the ground, Kipnu could barely touch the pebbles below him but it was enough to stop and catch his breath while he pushed closer to the shore. The air struck his already-freezing body, but he carried on until he was close enough to get the kaln's attention. "Hey!" he yelled with his arms held high, hoping to catch the attention of the kaln. Thi noticed and spared not a moment running toward him. With quick movements, thi reached for Kipnu's wrists and cut each length of vinegrass with a small dagger that barely fit into his hands. The blade was smell, but effective in such deft hands.

"Go help the others," the kaln said and Kipnu nodded in assent.

He spotted a maman struggling in the water some twenty paces away, looking as though hae muscles were seizing in the cold. A surge of urgency rushed through him, as he jumped back into the depths with his arms now free to move his body where it needed to be. By the time he'd reached hae spot in the water, thi had become cataleptic and unresponsive to his calls. Without a thought, Kipnu latched hae chest under his arm, making sure thi was still above water. Thi looked at him with glazed eyes, confused and disoriented and no longer human. He knew that thi was close to hae last moments of consciouness, so he had to act fast. "Come on. Stay awake, kid," he said, and he started pulling hae back with all the strength that his body could manage. A wave overtook his head and filled his nose with that cold salty brine. And one after another, the waves crested over them with every pace they gained toward the land.

Suddenly a hand pulled him forward, then another, and another until he felt a certain gravity toward the air, toward the land that only a team ten-strong could muster. They lifted hae body out of the water and laid hae out on the sand, waiting eagerly as Kipnu searched for signs of life. "No... no no," he said out loud, pleading with the sluggish heartbeats and shallow breaths trickling slowly under his fingers.

He quickly moved onto the ground and lifted the maman onto his own body, hae cold skin feeling like the ocean. In a cross-armed gesture, he set his arms in front of hae chest and pulled down, repeating at a steady pace to encourage hae hearts. By now his whole body was exhausted, but he knew he could endure it – there was no other option.

The others gathered around to watch what was happening when the mysterious kaln, hae voice as confident as ever, called out over the crowd. "We need kindling for a fire," thi said. "Everyone, to the forest. Find some dry pieces of wood."

The group sprung into action running toward the treeline while the kaln started digging a shallow chasm in the sand - a place for the fire, Kipnu surmised. He was still with the maman, pushing on hae hearts and warming hae up. Suddenly, he felt a writhing and a cough as the maman rolled onto hae side and took a sharp breath of air. "That's it," he said, as thi breathed. "You're on land now. You're safe."

Thi looked at him with kanosin-blue eyes, dazed and shivering but slowly regaining consciousness. "You... your arms are warm," thi said. Kipnu smiled, happy to see hae mind coming back to hae. He cajoled hae back into his arms to calm hae shivers, hoping not to give any misleading signals with his warmth.

Soon people came trickling in, placing small twigs and branches in the recess the kaln built to form a cone-like shape. After the cone was sufficiently built, the kaln produced a firestarter and a dry notebook from a peculiar bag at hae waist. Thi took the firestarter in hae hand and turned its spinning magnetic rotor. After a seemingly calculated moment, thi pushed a lever to expose the hot center pole and pressed it to firmly the paper which began to darken and smolder. A crowd began forming around hae to shield the fledgling fire from the chilly breeze. Thi gently breathed onto the paper until smoke started to appear, then added a strange moss that smoldered even brighter, and finally a small flame alighted from hae hands. With careuly acuity, thi moved it to the bottom of the pile of sticks they had built and the flame grew bigger. The crowd hollered at the sight: a hint of warmth to come. Carefully, Kipnu helped the maman toward the newly forming fire and they sat down in front of it. He could feel that hae shivers had slowed and hae cognition was returning, and for the first time since leaving Heiko, he felt some bit of relief.

"I'm Kipnu," he said.

An anxious pause in the air between them. "G-Ginnu," thi finally said with a tremor in hae voice.

"I was afraid you wouldn't make it," he said.

Thi laughed between shivers in a resigned sort of way. "Wouldn't be the f-first time someone said that". He wasn't sure what thi meant, but thought it best not to pry.

Everyone was huddled closely around the fire now, squatting and staring at the only warmth in this place. He caught sight of the kaln, now warming haeself by the fire, and wondered at who thi was. How could a kid know so much about this place? Where did thi come from?

He looked over at Ginnu and saw hae already asleep next to him. Many of the others had started to do the same. "A moment's nap couldn't hurt", he said to himself. With heavy eyes he laid himself down at Ginnu's feet and let go of his thoughts for a short rest.

---

Kipnu awoke in the darkness, cold from the distant Ara at the end of the day. Night was strangely dark here, with clouds forming above them and the light of Ara barely peeking over the horizon. The fire had died and his woven clothes were still holding fast to a few patches of dampness where the cool breeze had a bitter edge. His belly grumbled, wanting for any morsel of food he could find. Slowly, he rose again and looked around in the dark. Ginnu was sound asleep, breathing heavily with hae back to the sand. But the kaln seemed to be missing from where thi had been sitting before.

Out of habit or concern, he wasn't sure, but he whispered to Ginnu, "I'll be right back," and stood up to go searching for the kaln.

He moved to the remnants of fire, seeking some manner of fire to light his path. A few forgotten branches that had been reserved for stoking the fire had been left in the sand so he gathered all but a few thin sticks and added them to the embers in hopes that they might light. With the thinner ones and a bit of thick vinegrass cloth from his coat, he fashioned a makeshift torch and lit it from the embers of the fire. _This ought to last me,_ he thought. _Thi couldn't have gone far_.

With the little bit of light from his torch he traced the area, taking care to watch where he tread. He spotted an opening in the treeline, the ground around it littered with fragmented leaves and the distinctly tannic aroma of dampened anomin leaves. He hesitated, looking around for a more promising clue but nothing was certain to him in this unfamiliar place. So he took a step and let his feet lead him further into the dark.

The canopy was thick with leaves and branches that danced against the dark blue sky above, leaving very little light for him to see with. This was not a place for people: there were no fruits to forage, no animals scurrying up and down the trees or whistling upon the air. It was unsettlingly silent. The stories of Ulukoma that he heard in passing had painted a picture of a rough-built village of even rougher people. He'd never heard mention of trees really, much less an entire forest. But now that he'd seen the place with his own eyes, it seemed to him that the entire island was covered in them. Perhaps the stories were made more grandiose by hyperbole, as most stories are. Or perhaps there was more to this island that was yet to be discovered.

Kipnu listened closely for signs of life as he walked along the path, attempting to quiet his rustling, muddy footsteps. He came to a small clearing where he noticed a peculiar ornament mounted to the trunk of a tree. It was made of thin strands of copper spun repeatedly into a ring the size of his hand, and oxidized to a dull green patina. A metallic bead was suspended at the center by thin threads loosely tied to the outer ring. He stopped to study it, running his hands and fingers against the wires, imagining all the strange things it might be used for.

"Are you lost?" A voice suddenly called out.

He turned around to find the mysterious kaln behind him.

"You've been following me?" Kipnu asked.

"Yes," thi said, "They know you're here."

"Who?"

"The ones who live here. They know the schedule. They wait for you to starve and then come to collect you when you're weak."

"How do you know all this?"

"This is my home."

Kipnu was aghast imagining what this child's life might be like.

"Where are your parents?" he asked.

But the kaln hesitated to answer.

"Please," he pleaded. "I have no reason to–"

Kipnu saw the kaln shift hae gaze and widen hae eyes at something behind him. He flung himself around with his torch held high and nearly hit the nose of a woman. She was dressed in a thick coat of black kelp, her skin covered with luminescent blue markings. She grunted at the torch and quickly flicked a wooden pole to remove it from Kipnu's hand.

He began to run, but he didn't notice a simple tree root at his feet that tripped his feet and he tumbled onto the ground with a clumsy thud. The woman ran after the kaln, but Kipnu grabbed her ankles to stop her. She too stumbled to the ground with her pole beside her, but in an instant she freed herself from Kipnu's grasp and was back on her feet searching for the child. Much to her chagrin, the darkness and the leaves had veiled the path around them. With a frustrated huff she ambled toward Kipnu, crushing the light from his makeshift torch under her bare foot.

"How do you know Linyu?!" she demanded. Her arm was pinning him to the ground with insuperable force. Kipnu was silent, shocked by the deathly gaze of this strange woman. The glowing patterns of her skin filled his eyes and illuminated her own. He tried to wrestle free, but she held the pole tightly against his neck to stop him.

"Don't run," she said. "The others won't be so forgiving. Besides, nobody here wants you dead." She leaned in closer to his face and smirked at him. "We like our prey alive."
