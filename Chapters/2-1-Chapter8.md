## Chapter 8

The ship to Ulukoma looked like it was made by a generation of Throngia no longer living, and instead of being repaired correctly it was patched up with scrap boards and rusted nails. Despite its mostly ramshackle shape, it adorned a pair of thick, electrical risers built to press tightly against the rails above. Kipnu was used to saffas and trains, not this ever-rocking monstrosity. But the trip wasn't long, and he might have believed he deserved such a punishment if he thought about it long enough.

The captain was a tall, muscular woman by the name of Nanta, or at least that's what he overheard the escort call her. The ship had only a few exiles like him aboard, but each was accompanied by an armed escort. Most of them seemed mentally detached and he wondered what each had been sent for. At the end of the line of exiles was a kaln, somewhere on the verge of being an adult. Thi had faint blue eyes that stared into space: a sign of kanosin withdraw. He hoped that one of the others was a parent.

 _These people need medical help. Ulu will only make them worse._

The ship had sailed until the land behind them had disappeared, and before them was a large island full of tall trees and an aroma of smoked fish in the air. The dusk of the sky made everything feel like the end of the day, but Kipnu knew that Ara had only just begun to recede. Kipnu's escort shoved him into a line along the side of the boat with the others. All of their arms were still tied together and the ship was still quite a ways from shore.

"Ballast!" called the captain, and all of the escorts and crew members braced themselves against the ship. All of a sudden the ship unlatched from the electrical rails and started to lurch sideways. The others around him tried desparately to hold onto the floor or each other, but it had all been oiled and polished specifically for them to fall off it. Kipnu looked up at the escorts. They chuckled as they watched the kaln try to jam two fingers into a niche in the deck. He tried to help, but he couldn't gather the footing to get closer, and thi slipped and tumbled into the water before he could reach the kaln's hands. His own feet started slipping and he looked up again, vowing never to forget those faces.

The cold water pierced his skin and disoriented him. For a moment, direction was irrelevant, but he remembered to hold his breath so that physics could do the rest. _Up is to the left_, he realized and then kicked his feet to set his head upright and surface. Everyone who had been dumped into the water struggled to stay afloat. He knew he didn't have the strength to help them - he had to swim.

"On your back! Use your feet!" cried a maman. Thi was speaking to the kaln, but all in the group adjusted to hae direction.

The cold turned into numbness as he kept his head above water and kicked his hardest toward the shore. The current was moving against him; it would surely push him back if he stopped, but his efforts were focused on getting to shore, and he had purged his mind of all other worries in order to survive. He felt a tug at his leg in the middle of an exhale and his body went under while another person clambered over his submerged back, leaving him disoriented and deprived of oxygen. He panicked and flailed around in the water until his feet touched something solid. _The water isn't so deep here_, he thought. _I must be close_. He dug his toes into the pebble bed and pushed himself back toward his goal. He made it to standing depth and stopped to catch his breath while he looked for other people make it ashore. He spotted the young maman and hae mother, struggling together quite a ways out. It looked as though the kaln's muscles were seizing in the cold and hae mother didnt have the strength to pull both of them. A surge of urgency rushed through him, and he jumped back into the depths with his arms still bound in front of him. He had swam nearly 30 paces before he reached them. The kaln was unresponsive and hae mother was dazed, trying hae best to move both of their bodies to shore, but not making much progress. Without a thought, Kipnu latched the kaln's head under his arms, making sure thi was above water. He told the maman,

"I'll get hae back. Focus on yourself."

Thi looked at him with glazed over eyes, confused and disoriented, but Kipnu saw that the kaln had nearly become unconscious, so he had to move.

"Come on. Stay awake, kid," he said, and he pushed the water with all his legs could push. Kipnu saw hae mother follow him, as if instinct had taken over.

They got ashore, and Kipnu searched for a pulse.

"Shit. No no no," he said. "Don't die. You're too young for that."

He quickly moved onto the ground and lifted the kaln onto his own body. Hae skin had gone cold. In a cross-armed gesture, he set his arms in front of hae chest and rapidlly pulled down at a steady pace. The others gathered around them to watch what was happening.

"The fire. We have to get hae to the fire," called a man from the crowd.

"That's thousands of paces away," said a woman.

"Well this isn't working," the man responded.

Kipnu butted in between pulses, "Everyone, gather kindling, from the forest. We'll start, a fire here."

Those who were able sprung into action while the kaln's mother lifted haeself out of the water and rushed over to Kipnu, still pushing on the child's hearts.

Thi said, "I'm a doctor from Shaki. I can take over if you're tired."

Kipnu responded between pushes. "Shouldn't...stop". Thi understood and started digging a pit in the pebbles near the two to construct a fire. The others had started to bring small twigs and place them in the pit, orienting them to form a cone. Suddenly, a cough was heard and everyone turned to find the child moving.

"Linyu!" said the maman, and thi immediately pulled hae from Kipnu and laid hae on hae side.

Kipnu remained still on his back, catching his breath from all the commotion that had just occurred.

A woman in the crowd produced a hot tip and a still-dry notebook from a peculiar bag at her waist. She took the tip in her shaking hands and revved it up while pressing it into the paper while the people crowded around to shield her from the wind. The woman breathed gently onto the fire until embers and smoke started to appear. The crowd hollered at the smell: a hint of warmth to come. The maman carefully moved the child toward where the kindling was placed and set hae down on hae lap. The others started bring small dry leaves to the woman who was making good progress on smoldering paper.

Kipnu had finally caught his breath and moved toward the maman and hae child.

"I'm Kipnu," he said to the maman.

The child murmured, "m-m-mh," but hae mother calmed hae down.

"Casra," thi said abruptly, but warmly.

Casra kept hae arms and legs wrapped around the child while the smolders turned to flames and then to fire and slowly their shivers settled. The whole group was huddled closely around the fire now, napping or huddled to regain their strength.

"Colder than I thought it would be," said Casra, trying to make small talk.

Kipnu paused, wondering if he should mention the obscura.

Thi changed the subject, "Where did you learn to do that?"

"Learn to do...?"

"Hypothermic chest compressions. That's not a common thing to know."

"I'm a doctor. From Heiko."

Casra laughed, "Two doctors in Ulukoma. What are the odds?"

He smiled to himself - he was pondering the same thing.

"So..." he asked, "How did you wind up here?"

"If you don't mind, I'd prefer to ask you first."

"Yes... of course." he said, embarassed.

"No it's not that I think you're a bad person, I justâ€“"

"I get it. I'm a strange man in Ulukoma. And you have a kaln to look after. I'll give you the unfiltered version. There was this guy who wanted to send my jundmaman to space."

Casra laughed until thi noticed that Kipnu wasn't.

"You're not joking about that?" thi asked.

He continued, "So I get angry, and pin him against a wall, and I tell him, politely, to fuck off. Magistrate walks in, sentences me on the spot."

"Oh. That... must be a long story," thi said.

"No, that's basically it."

Kipnu felt a sense of longing for Liffa and Melna, and he wondered when he would see them again.

"So how about you?" he asked. "Hope it's a bit less complicated."

"It's...well I suppose it's a story best told somewhere more quiet."

"Sure."

Casra noticed that Kipnu was getting sleepy. Thi whispered to him, "Hey, why don't you rest. We're safe out here on the beach."

He nodded and lied down next to the two of them, taking one last glance at the kaln to check his breathing, and drifted off to sleep. Casra looked at him admiringly, as if to wonder how such a good heart could be sent to such a miserable place. But thi remembered that all hearts have a dark side, including her own.

---

Kipnu woke up in the darkness, cold from the lack of a fire and clothes that were still a bit damp. _What time of day is it? Can hardly tell in the eternal twilight here_. His belly grumbled and told him it had been at least a va'la since he ate. Slowly, he rose his cold and aching back to an upright position, and then noticed that Casra and the child were gone. _Where would they have run off to in this darkness? I need to find them._ He moved to the fire and searched for a flame to rekindle from, and then took some thicker branches from the pile to re-stoke the fire, saving a handful of thinner ones for his makeshift torch. The darkness was something he had anticipated, but he had never planned for the difficulties of surviving in the wild. The stories of Ulukoma had always painted to him a picture of a large prison, not a lawless forest island. But now wasn't the time to be frustrated about the past; he carried the light into the towering forest, determined to uncover its mysteries and secure nourishment for his new group.

The forest floor was covered with dried thin leaves and branches that had fallen from the canopy. Kipnu listened closely for signs of life as he tried his best to quiet his crunching underfoot. This was not a place for Throngia. There were no shrubs to forage, no fruiting clusters in sight, no animals scurrying up and down trees or whistling upon the air. It was unsettlingly silent. He cleared a patch of ground looking for anything that might have fallen, but only roots and compacted leaves appeared.

"There was a bonfire when we came in. That must be from the other exiles. They must have food somehow," he said to himself. His memory of where the fire was foggy but he set out in the direction of Ulu, where he presumed the center of the island to be.

He came to a small clearing in the trees where he noticed a peculiar wrapping on one of them. It was made of thin rings of copper running around the trunk, forming a spiral, and oxidized to a sea green patina by the salt water in the air. On the top end of the spiral, the copper straightened out and stretched up the tree further than he could see. It looked to be for some strange tool that he couldn't fathom. He stopped to study them, running his hands and fingers against the wires, imagining all the strange things it might be used for.

"Are you lost?" A voice suddenly called out.

He turned around to find the child following his footsteps.

"You've been following me?"

"Yes. They know you're here."

"Who?"

"The other exiles. They know the schedule. They wait for you to starve and then come to collect you when you're weak."

"How do you know all this?"

"This isn't my first time here."

Kipnu was aghast imagining what this child's life might be like.

"Where are your parents?"

"My father lives on the mainland. My nather lives here, and my mother..."

"Lives here? What do you mean?"

Kipnu was confused, but then noticed that the kaln had been staring wide-eyed at something behind him. Kipnu turned around quickly with his torch held high and caught the nose of a woman dressed in a robe of feathers and thin woven reeds, covered with blue luminescent flow tattoos. In her left hand was a wooden spear as tall as she was. She grunted with fury at the fire, and yanked the torch from Kipnu's grasp with ease. Kipnu and the child began to run, but Kipnu struggled to see in the dark and tripped on a root after only a few steps. The woman ran after the child, but in a last ditch effort to save hae Kipnu grabbed the woman's legs and toppled her to the ground along with the torch. Her body twisted in an instant, wrestling free from Kipnu's grasp, and she jumped forward to search for the child but the darkness and leaves had veiled hae path. The woman stood frustrated for a few moments before turning her attention back to Kipnu. She walked toward him with a furious look on her face, crushing the torch under her bare foot.

She grabbed him by the shirt and demanded, "What do you know of Linyu?!"

Kipnu remained silent in shock. The luminescent ink in her skin was reflecting off of Kipnu's terrified face and illuminating her own. Kipnu tried to wrestle free, but Setre drew her spear close to his neck.

"Running is futile. Trust me, nobody here wants you dead."

She leaned in closer to his face and smirked at him.

"They like their slaves alive."
