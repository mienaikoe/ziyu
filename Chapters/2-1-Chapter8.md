## Chapter 8

The creaky wooden ship to Ulukoma looked like it was made by a generation no longer living. It was patched up with scrap boards and rusted nails that were raised from the boards they were meant to hold tightly to the beams below. Despite its mostly ramshackle shape the ship cut swiftly through the water under the power of an electric motor that hummed and rattled every plank and nail on the deck they stood upon. Kipnu was used to saffas and trains, not this ever-rocking monstrosity, but he took solace in knowing they would arrive shortly. He might have believed that he deserved to be on that ship if he thought about it long enough.

The captain was a tall, muscular woman by the name of Nanta, or at least that's what he overheard the Shaki guard call her when he was taken aboard. The rest of the crew were rather unkempt men and women with stippled faces and miserable expressions. The ship's "cargo" – as the crew called them – was a handful exiles like him, their hands all bound with rope in front of them as they sat down in a line on the right side of the deck. Kipnu observed their expressions, watched all of them staring blankly into their own minds. Some were afraid and others were simply resigned. One peculiar guest caught his eye: a kaln with unbound hands (or was thi still a fully grown maman? He wondered if he wasn't the only one confused about hae age). Thi was standing at the bow, dressed in thick black kelp and peering out on the dark horizon. A faint blueish pattern shown on hae back. Some sort of marking made in kanosin? Kipnu couldn't be sure. But he knew that something was off about hae, as if no one else on the ship could see hae except for him.

The land behind them had disappeared by the time he noticed a dark silhouette before them: an island full of tall trees and nothing visible save for the sand along the shoreline illuminated by the reddish hue of Ara low on the horizon. The dusk of the sky made everything feel like evening, but Kipnu knew that the day was still at its peak.

"Ballast!" called the captain, and all the crew rushed to the left side of the ship to wrap their wrists in bit of rope they'd prepared. Kipnu felt the ship begin to tilt to the right. "Turn!" cried the captain again as she pulled a steel lever on her left. The ship lurched violently to the left and began to roll onto its side. The others tried desperately to hold onto the railing, onto each other, but their hands were in no position to catch anything. One by one, they began to fall into the water as the ship continued to tip further and further. Kipnu tried to jam two fingers into a niche he'd found in the deck, but the gap was too small for his fingers to find a solid place to grasp. A large wave bared its breast before them and bore the weight of the ship on its back, creaking the deck beneath them. Kipnu knew the crash would wrest the last of his strength so with his last moments there he looked up at the captain as she smirked back at him and he vowed never to forget her face. With a boom the ship hit the water and his fingers released their grip on the deck. For a moment he was helpless, hanging in the air with nowhere to go but down. But as down is the most insistent of directions, his body met with the dark ocean below him.

The cold water pierced his skin and covered his whole body with a feeling of needles.The shock disoriented him, scattered his sense of direction across the waves, but he remembered to hold his breath and let it come to him. Bubbles of air began trickling across his face as they fluttered to his left. _That is where up is_, he thought. With a sequence of kicks and jerking motions, he set his head upright and found the surface.

"On your back!" A voice called to them. "Use your feet!". It was the strange kaln from the bow, treading water and calling out to the group as they struggled to stay afloat. Kipnu wanted to help them all, but he knew he could never help while his hands bound - he had to keep himself afloat and listen to the kaln. "This way!" the kaln called to them again from further away. Thi seemed to know the way to land.

The cold froze his skin numb as Kipnu did all he could to keep his head above the water as he followed the kaln's voice. The waves felt as if they would push him under if he stopped kicking. But he knew he wouldn't stop unless he gave up on himself. He trusted the mind he had trained to do nothing but think in critical situations like this.

He felt a tug at his leg in the middle of an exhale and his body went under while another person clambered over his submerged back, leaving him disoriented and deprived of oxygen. He panicked and flailed around in the water until his feet touched something solid. _The water isn't so deep here_, he thought. _I must be close_. He dug his toes into the pebble bed and pushed himself back toward his goal. He made it to standing depth and stopped to catch his breath while he looked for other people make it ashore. He spotted the young maman and hae mother, struggling together quite a ways out. It looked as though the kaln's muscles were seizing in the cold and hae mother didnt have the strength to pull both of them. A surge of urgency rushed through him, and he jumped back into the depths with his arms still bound in front of him. He had swam nearly 30 paces before he reached them. The kaln was unresponsive and hae mother was dazed, trying hae best to move both of their bodies to shore, but not making much progress. Without a thought, Kipnu latched the kaln's head under his arms, making sure thi was above water. He told the maman,

"I'll get hae back. Focus on yourself."

Thi looked at him with glazed over eyes, confused and disoriented, but Kipnu saw that the kaln had nearly become unconscious, so he had to move.

"Come on. Stay awake, kid," he said, and he pushed the water with all his legs could push. Kipnu saw hae mother follow him, as if instinct had taken over.

They got ashore, and Kipnu searched for a pulse.

"Shit. No no no," he said. "Don't die. You're too young for that."

He quickly moved onto the ground and lifted the kaln onto his own body. Hae skin had gone cold. In a cross-armed gesture, he set his arms in front of hae chest and rapidly pulled down at a steady pace. The others gathered around them to watch what was happening.

"The fire. We have to get hae to the fire," called a man from the crowd.

"That's thousands of paces away," said a woman.

"Well this isn't working," the man responded.

Kipnu butted in between pulses, "Everyone, gather kindling, from the forest. We'll start a fire here."

Those who were able sprung into action while the kaln's mother lifted haeself out of the water and rushed over to Kipnu, still pushing on the child's hearts.

Thi said, "I'm a doctor from Shaki. I can take over if you're tired."

Kipnu responded between pushes. "Shouldn't...stop". Thi understood and started digging a pit in the pebbles near the two to construct a fire. The others had started to bring small twigs and place them in the pit, orienting them to form a cone. Suddenly, a cough was heard and everyone turned to find the child moving.

"Linyu!" said the maman, and thi immediately pulled hae from Kipnu and laid hae on hae side.

Kipnu remained still on his back, catching his breath from all the commotion that had just occurred.

A woman in the crowd produced a firestarter and a still-dry notebook from a peculiar bag at her waist. She took the tip in her shaking hands and revved it up while pressing it into the paper while the people crowded around to shield her from the wind. The woman breathed gently onto the fire until embers and smoke started to appear. The crowd hollered at the smell: a hint of warmth to come. The maman carefully moved the child toward where the kindling was placed and set hae down on hae lap. The others started bring small dry leaves to the woman who was making good progress on smoldering paper.

Kipnu had finally caught his breath and moved toward the maman and hae child.

"I'm Kipnu," he said to the maman.

The child murmured, "m-m-mh," but hae mother calmed hae down.

"Casra," thi said abruptly, but warmly.

"It's a miracle your kaln made it. Thi's resilient."

Casra nodded in quiet agreement and kept hae arms and legs wrapped around the child while thi watched the smolders turned to flames and then fire. Slowly their shivers settled and their wet clothes dried. The whole group was huddled closely around the fire now, squatting and staring at the only light in this place.

"Colder than I thought it would be," said Casra, trying to make small talk.

Kipnu paused, wondering if he should mention the obscura.

Thi changed the subject, "Where did you learn to do that?"

"Learn to do...?"

"Hypothermic chest compressions. That's not a common thing to know."

"I'm a doctor. From Heiko."

Casra laughed, "Two doctors in Ulukoma. What are the odds?"

He smiled to himself - he was pondering the same thing.

"So..." he asked, "How did you wind up here?"

Thi hesitated. "If you don't mind, I'd prefer to ask you first."

"Yes... of course." he said, embarassed.

"No it's not that I think you're a bad person, I just–"

"I get it. I'm a strange man in Ulukoma. And you have a kaln to look after. I'll give you the unfiltered version. There was this guy who wanted to send my jundmaman to space."

Casra laughed until thi noticed that Kipnu wasn't.

"You're not joking about that, are you?" thi asked.

He continued, "I got angry... and I pinned him against a wall. Told him, politely, that he'd made a big mistake."

"Oh. That... must be a long story," thi said.

"No, that's basically it."

Kipnu felt a sense of longing for Liffa and Melna, and he wondered when he would see them again.

"So how about you?" he asked. "Hope it's a bit less complicated."

"It's...well I suppose it's a story best told elsewhere."

"Sure."

Casra noticed that Kipnu was getting sleepy. Thi whispered to him, "Hey, why don't you rest. We're safe out here on the beach."

He nodded and lied down next to the two of them, taking one last glance at the kaln to check his breathing, and drifted off to sleep. Casra looked at him admiringly, as if to wonder how such a good heart could be sent to such a miserable place. But thi remembered that all people have a dark side, including herself.

---

Kipnu woke up in the darkness, cold from the death of the fire and his woven clothes holdnig fast to the damp. His belly grumbled and told him it had been at least a va'la since he ate. Slowly, he rose his aching back to an upright position, and then noticed that Casra and the child were gone. _Where would they have run off to in this darkness? I need to find them._ He moved to the fire and searched for a flame to rekindle from. He found some branches that were reserved for re-stoking the fire, and added the thicker ones to the fire, while he fashioned a handful of thinner ones into a makeshift torch. With the little bit of light from his torch, he followed the imprints of their feet until they disappeared at the treeline where thin leaves littered the ground and gave off a bittersweet aroma.

The darkness of the beach was something he had anticipated, but the forest was of an entirely different class. The canopy was thick with leaves and branches, leaving very little light for ground-dwellers like him. He would have to track and plan his path: something he was wholly unprepared for. The stories of Ulukoma had painted a picture of a sprawling shanty town, with scarcely a mention of trees. But now was the time to focus; he carried the light into the towering forest, determined to find his new friends.

Kipnu listened closely for signs of life as he attempted to quiet his rustling footsteps. This was not a place for people. There were no shrubs to forage, no fruiting clusters in sight, no animals scurrying up and down trees or whistling upon the air. It was unsettlingly silent. He cleared a patch of ground looking for anything that might have fallen, but only roots and compacted leaves appeared.

"There was smoke when we came in. That must be from the other exiles. They must have food somehow," he said to himself. His understanding of Ulukoma was hazy at best but he set out in the direction of Ulu, where he presumed the center of the island to be.

There was a small clearing in the trees where he noticed a peculiar ornament on one of them. It was made of thin rings of copper, forming a spiral, and oxidized to a sea green patina by the salt water in the air. On the top end of the spiral, the metal straightened out and entered the tree's trunk. It looked to be some strange tool that he couldn't fathom. He stopped to study them, running his hands and fingers against the wires, imagining all the strange things it might be used for.

"Are you lost?" A voice suddenly called out.

He turned around to find the child following his footsteps.

"You've been following me?" Kipnu asked.

"Yes," thi said, "They know you're here."

"Who?"

"The other exiles. They know the schedule. They wait for you to starve and then come to collect you when you're weak."

"How do you know all this?"

"This is my home."

Kipnu was aghast imagining what this child's life might be like.

"Where is your mother?" he asked.

"My mother is waiting."

"Waiting for what?"

Kipnu looked into Linyu's eyes for answers, then noticed that the kaln had been staring wide-eyed at something behind him. Kipnu flung himself around with his torch held high and caught the nose of a woman. She was dressed in a thick coat of black kelp, her skin covered with luminescent blue markings. She grunted at the torch and quickly flicked a wooden pole to remove it from Kipnu's hand.

He began to run, but he didn't notice a simple tree root at his feet that tumbled him onto the ground. The woman ran after Linyu, but Kipnu grabbed her ankles in an attempt to save hae. She stumbled to the ground with her pole beside her, but in an instant she freed herself from Kipnu's grasp and was back on her feet searching for the child. But much to her chagrin, the darkness and the leaves had veiled hae path. With a frustrated huff she ambled toward Kipnu, crushing the makeshift torch under her bare foot.

"How do you know Linyu?!" she demanded. Her arm was pinning him to the ground. Kipnu remained silent in shock. The luminescent glow of her skin filled his eyes and illuminating her own. He tried to wrestle free, but she held the pole tightly against his neck to stop him.

"Don't run," she said. "The other guardians won't be so forgiving. Besides, nobody here wants you dead." She leaned in closer to his face and smirked at him. "We like our prey alive."
