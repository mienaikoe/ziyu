## Chapter 8

The creaky wooden ship to Ulukoma looked like it was made by a generation no longer living. It was patched up with scrap boards and rusted nails that were raised from the boards they were meant to hold tightly to the beams below. Despite its mostly ramshackle shape the ship cut swiftly through the water under the power of an electric motor that hummed and rattled every plank and nail on the deck they stood upon. Kipnu was used to saffas and trains, not this ever-rocking monstrosity, but he took solace in knowing they would arrive shortly. He might have believed that he deserved to be on that ship if he thought about it long enough.

The captain was a tall, muscular woman by the name of Nanta, or at least that's what he overheard the Shaki guard call her when he was taken aboard. The rest of the crew were rather unkempt men and women with stippled faces and miserable expressions. The ship's "cargo" – as the crew called them – was a handful exiles like him, their hands all bound with rope in front of them as they sat down in a line on the right side of the deck. Kipnu observed their expressions, watched all of them staring blankly into their own minds. Some were afraid and others were simply resigned. And others had the blue haze in their eyes: a sign of kanosin withdrawal. He hadn't seen many cases, but Kipnu knew it when he saw it.

One peculiar guest caught his eye: a kaln with unbound hands (or was thi still a fully grown maman? He wondered if he wasn't the only one confused about hae age). Thi was standing at the bow, dressed in thick black kelp and peering out on the dark horizon. Thi was too young to work the ship, much less be made a prisoner of Ulukoma. What thi was doing there, Kipnu couldn't be sure, but he knew that something was off about hae. It felt as if no one else on the ship could see hae except for him.

The land behind them had disappeared by the time he noticed a dark silhouette before them: an island full of tall trees and nothing visible save for the sand along the shoreline illuminated by the reddish hue of Ara low on the horizon. The dusk of the sky made everything feel like evening, but Kipnu knew that the day was still at its peak.

"Ballast!" called the captain, and all the crew rushed to the left side of the ship to wrap their wrists in bit of rope they'd prepared. Kipnu felt the ship begin to tilt to the right. "Turn!" cried the captain again as she pulled a steel lever on her left. The ship lurched violently to the left and began to roll onto its side. The others tried desperately to hold onto the railing, onto each other, but their hands were in no position to catch anything. One by one, they began to fall into the water as the ship continued to tip further and further. Kipnu tried to jam two fingers into a niche he'd found in the deck, but the gap was too small for his fingers to find a solid place to grasp. A large wave bared its breast before them and bore the weight of the ship on its back, creaking the deck beneath them. Kipnu knew the crash would wrest the last of his strength so with his last moments there he looked up at the captain as she smirked back at him and he vowed never to forget her face. With a boom the ship hit the water and his fingers released their grip on the deck. For a moment he was helpless, hanging in the air with nowhere to go but down. But as down is the most insistent of directions, his body met with the dark ocean below him.

The cold water pierced his skin and covered his whole body with a feeling of needles.The shock disoriented him, scattered his sense of direction across the waves, but he remembered to hold his breath and let it come to him. Bubbles of air began trickling and fluttering across his face from his right cheek to the left. _Floating up_, he thought. And with a sequence of kicks and jerking motions, he set his head upright and found the surface.

Kipnu breathed in the cool air and warmed his face with his exhales. He looked around and saw a sea of terrified faces struggling to stay afloat.

"On your back!" A voice called over the water. "Use your feet!". It was the strange kaln from the bow, treading on the waves and giving directions. Kipnu wanted to help but he knew that the kaln was in a far better place to do that - he had to focus on keeping himself afloat. "This way!" the kaln called to them again from further away. Thi was leading them to the shore.

The cold in his skin turned to a dull pain as Kipnu fought to keep his head above the water and follow the kaln's voice. The waves were small but unrelentless, as if they would pull him out to sea if he didn't stop pushing. But he trusted his mind; he'd trained himself to think clearly in situations like this. His resolve to live and the rousing voice of a kaln were all he needed to stay alive.

<!-- In medical training he was taught to repeat a phrase to keep himself calm; _Apathy kills. Agility cures._ -->

"Where the waves begin to break, you can stand," said the kaln. Thi was waiting on the shallows, pulling people out of the water. "If you still have strength, come to me."

With his toes pointing toward the ground, Kipnu could barely touch the pebbles below him but it was enough to stop and catch his breath while he pushed closer to the shore. The air struck his already-freezing body, but he carried on until he was close enough to get the kaln's attention. "Hey!" he yelled with his arms held high, hoping to catch the attention of the kaln. Thi noticed and spared not a moment running toward him. With quick movements, thi reached for Kipnu's wrists and cut each length of vinegrass with a small dagger that barely fit into his hands. The blade was smell, but effective in such deft hands.

"Go help the others," the kaln said and Kipnu nodded in assent.

He spotted a maman struggling in the water some twenty paces away, looking as though hae muscles were seizing in the cold. A surge of urgency rushed through him, as he jumped back into the depths with his arms now free to move his body where it needed to be. By the time he'd reached hae spot in the water, thi had become cataleptic and unresponsive to his calls. Without a thought, Kipnu latched hae chest under his arm, making sure thi was still above water. Thi looked at him with glazed eyes, confused and disoriented and no longer human. He knew that thi was close to hae last moments of consciouness, so he had to act fast. "Come on. Stay awake, kid," he said, and he started pulling hae back with all the strength that his body could manage. A wave overtook his head and filled his nose with that cold salty brine. And one after another, the waves crested over them with every pace they gained toward the land.

Suddenly a hand pulled him forward, then another, and another until he felt a certain gravity toward the air, toward the land that only a team ten-strong could muster. They lifted hae body out of the water and laid hae out on the sand, waiting eagerly as Kipnu searched for a pulse. "No no no don't die," he pleaded with the heartbeats trickling slowly under his fingers.

He quickly moved onto the ground and lifted the maman onto his own body, hae cold skin feeling like the ocean. In a cross-armed gesture, he set his arms in front of hae chest and pulled down, repeating at a steady pace to encourage hae hearts. By now his whole body was exhausted, but he knew he could endure it – he had to.

The others gathered around to watch what was happening when the mysterious kaln, hae voice as confident as ever, called out over the crowd. "Everyone, gather kindling, from the forest," thi said. "The maman needs warmth, and so do we."

The group sprung into action running toward the treeline while Kipnu remained with the maman, still pushing on hae hearts and warming hae up. Suddenly, he felt a writhing and a cough as the maman rolled onto hae side and took a sharp breath of air.

"That's it," he said. "You're here, you're safe."

Thi looked at him with kanosin eyes, dazed but slowly regaining consciousness. "You... your arms... warm," thi said, hae strength slowly coming back. Kipnu smiled and cajoled hae back into his arms to rest and warm up.

A few who stayed behind started digging a pit in the sand, and soon people came trickling in, adding small twigs and branches to form a cone-like shape in the wood. The kaln produced a firestarter and a still-dry notebook from a peculiar bag at hae waist. Thi took the tip in hae hands and revved it up while pressing it to the paper, a crowd forming around hae to shield the flame from the light wind. Gently, thi breathed onto the paper until embers and smoke started to appear, and finally a small flame alighted from hae hands and thi moved it to the pile of wood they had built. The crowd hollered at the sight: a hint of warmth to come. Carefully, Kipnu moved the maman toward the newly forming fire and and set hae upright in front of it.

<!-- left off -->
<!-- maman is Ginnu, Linyu is the commanding maman -->

Kipnu had finally caught his breath and moved toward the maman and hae child.

"I'm Kipnu," he said to the maman.

The child murmured, "m-m-mh," but hae mother calmed hae down.

"Casra," thi said abruptly, but warmly.

"It's a miracle your kaln made it. Thi's resilient."

Casra nodded in quiet agreement and kept hae arms and legs wrapped around the child while thi watched the smolders turned to flames and then fire. Slowly their shivers settled and their wet clothes dried. The whole group was huddled closely around the fire now, squatting and staring at the only light in this place.

"Colder than I thought it would be," said Casra, trying to make small talk.

Kipnu paused, wondering if he should mention the obscura.

Thi changed the subject, "Where did you learn to do that?"

"Learn to do...?"

"Hypothermic chest compressions. That's not a common thing to know."

"I'm a doctor. From Heiko."

Casra laughed, "Two doctors in Ulukoma. What are the odds?"

He smiled to himself - he was pondering the same thing.

"So..." he asked, "How did you wind up here?"

Thi hesitated. "If you don't mind, I'd prefer to ask you first."

"Yes... of course." he said, embarassed.

"No it's not that I think you're a bad person, I just–"

"I get it. I'm a strange man in Ulukoma. And you have a kaln to look after. I'll give you the unfiltered version. There was this guy who wanted to send my jundmaman to space."

Casra laughed until thi noticed that Kipnu wasn't.

"You're not joking about that, are you?" thi asked.

He continued, "I got angry... and I pinned him against a wall. Told him, politely, that he'd made a big mistake."

"Oh. That... must be a long story," thi said.

"No, that's basically it."

Kipnu felt a sense of longing for Liffa and Melna, and he wondered when he would see them again.

"So how about you?" he asked. "Hope it's a bit less complicated."

"It's...well I suppose it's a story best told elsewhere."

"Sure."

Casra noticed that Kipnu was getting sleepy. Thi whispered to him, "Hey, why don't you rest. We're safe out here on the beach."

He nodded and lied down next to the two of them, taking one last glance at the kaln to check his breathing, and drifted off to sleep. Casra looked at him admiringly, as if to wonder how such a good heart could be sent to such a miserable place. But thi remembered that all people have a dark side, including herself.

Kipnu woke up in the darkness, cold from the death of the fire and his woven clothes holdnig fast to the damp. His belly grumbled and told him it had been at least a va'la since he ate. Slowly, he rose his aching back to an upright position, and then noticed that Casra and the child were gone. _Where would they have run off to in this darkness? I need to find them._ He moved to the fire and searched for a flame to rekindle from. He found some branches that were reserved for re-stoking the fire, and added the thicker ones to the fire, while he fashioned a handful of thinner ones into a makeshift torch. With the little bit of light from his torch, he followed the imprints of their feet until they disappeared at the treeline where thin leaves littered the ground and gave off a bittersweet aroma.

The darkness of the beach was something he had anticipated, but the forest was of an entirely different class. The canopy was thick with leaves and branches, leaving very little light for ground-dwellers like him. He would have to track and plan his path: something he was wholly unprepared for. The stories of Ulukoma had painted a picture of a sprawling shanty town, with scarcely a mention of trees. But now was the time to focus; he carried the light into the towering forest, determined to find his new friends.

Kipnu listened closely for signs of life as he attempted to quiet his rustling footsteps. This was not a place for people. There were no shrubs to forage, no fruiting clusters in sight, no animals scurrying up and down trees or whistling upon the air. It was unsettlingly silent. He cleared a patch of ground looking for anything that might have fallen, but only roots and compacted leaves appeared.

"There was smoke when we came in. That must be from the other exiles. They must have food somehow," he said to himself. His understanding of Ulukoma was hazy at best but he set out in the direction of Ulu, where he presumed the center of the island to be.

There was a small clearing in the trees where he noticed a peculiar ornament on one of them. It was made of thin rings of copper, forming a spiral, and oxidized to a sea green patina by the salt water in the air. On the top end of the spiral, the metal straightened out and entered the tree's trunk. It looked to be some strange tool that he couldn't fathom. He stopped to study them, running his hands and fingers against the wires, imagining all the strange things it might be used for.

"Are you lost?" A voice suddenly called out.

He turned around to find the child following his footsteps.

"You've been following me?" Kipnu asked.

"Yes," thi said, "They know you're here."

"Who?"

"The other exiles. They know the schedule. They wait for you to starve and then come to collect you when you're weak."

"How do you know all this?"

"This is my home."

Kipnu was aghast imagining what this child's life might be like.

"Where is your mother?" he asked.

"My mother is waiting."

"Waiting for what?"

Kipnu looked into Linyu's eyes for answers, then noticed that the kaln had been staring wide-eyed at something behind him. Kipnu flung himself around with his torch held high and caught the nose of a woman. She was dressed in a thick coat of black kelp, her skin covered with luminescent blue markings. She grunted at the torch and quickly flicked a wooden pole to remove it from Kipnu's hand.

He began to run, but he didn't notice a simple tree root at his feet that tumbled him onto the ground. The woman ran after Linyu, but Kipnu grabbed her ankles in an attempt to save hae. She stumbled to the ground with her pole beside her, but in an instant she freed herself from Kipnu's grasp and was back on her feet searching for the child. But much to her chagrin, the darkness and the leaves had veiled hae path. With a frustrated huff she ambled toward Kipnu, crushing the makeshift torch under her bare foot.

"How do you know Linyu?!" she demanded. Her arm was pinning him to the ground. Kipnu remained silent in shock. The luminescent glow of her skin filled his eyes and illuminating her own. He tried to wrestle free, but she held the pole tightly against his neck to stop him.

"Don't run," she said. "The other guardians won't be so forgiving. Besides, nobody here wants you dead." She leaned in closer to his face and smirked at him. "We like our prey alive."
