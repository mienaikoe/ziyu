# Epilogue

It was hot again. And my body was shaken with fear.

"This is Liffa um Heiko. If anyone can hear me, I'm landing Lao 2-ka Ulu Ulukoma. Lao 2-ka. Ulu. Ulukoma. I need assistance."

There was no response.

"This is Liffa um Heiko. If-"

I yelled, "Dammit!" letting all of my frustration fall onto the instrument panel before me. The fire out the window was bright orange-yellow, and the vehicle shook violently. My back hadn't felt a squeezing like this before. I struggled with my entire body to stay in position, for surely I would hurt myself if I slipped down now.

"It's too late. I gotta ditch the antenna."

I lifted one small lever and closed another, and a metal rod unlatched itself from the capsule.

"Just survive, Liffa. One problem at a time."

I remembered the protocol from the first two slowdown burns. The red lever for red flames. Yellow lever when you see yellow. I had done those already. Maintain rotation with the silver knob. I had been so focused on getting contact that I didn't notice the capsule was spinning slowly. I moved the knob one way, and the capsule started rotating more. A nudge the other way, and it slowed. Slowly, the rotation stabilized as I read the dial above me, but my head felt like it was still spinning and my vision began to-

The flames fizzled out, and the squeezing feeling relaxed. I regained my thoughts an looked outside. It was dark everywhere save for the lanterns of cities. Only the thinnest glints of Ara peered through the obscura and threw their shadows onto the land.

"First chutes. 'Pink like the sky,' they said. Assholes..."

I pulled the knob and heard the pressurized air send the chutes out. I braced for their strong pull just before they fully unraveled and began to slow my descent. 

I had a moment to look out the porthole again and saw the thousand lantern lights of Rudjan below me. I wondered at them. If they had seen me making a mess of their sky. If they knew who I was, or if they just assumed I was another weapon of Holrag raining down upon Ulukoma. I figured that I was lucky they spared me such a mission.

"Second chutes at one lao'ka. 'Black like the ocean'."

I braced again and felt the tug of the chutes slow me down. Above me, I saw my airspeed dial begin to fall and rest at a low speed, and felt happy to at least know that I could feel the ocean beneath me before I passed. 

I held my anticipation for the splashdown, "Any moment now..."

But instead, I felt a hard, jarring *thud*. The capsule had stopped.

*What?*

I listened to the silence, and heard wind for the first time in what felt like a lifetime. A tear of bittersweet joy came to my eye as I sat in my seat, tightly nestled by the invisible tug of Palinan, my home. I wouldn't dare open the door until my mind had settled from this terrible ordeal.

*Footsteps. Someone heard me!* 

I unbuckled myself from the seat, and tried to raise myself out of it, but everything suddenly went sideways.

*What the fuck is happening to me?*

"Aye. Liffa?" called an unfamiliiar maman voice through the capsule walls.

*Who the...*

"Yes?" I screamed to be heard. "I'm Liffa. Who are you?"

"Nevermind that, we've come to get rescue you."

"Oh?!"

I heard some small thuds of something hitting the ground. And some muffled laughter.

*Where did I land?*

"Is something funny?" I asked.

"You'd think it were," said the voice, as it came right up against my metal house. There was some rapping and tugging against the door I had come in on, but it wouldn't budge.

"Little help?" thi said.

"Uh... sure," I said. I mustered up the strength to lift myself, slowly this time, and twist the latch of the door open. It made a loud *kachunk* as the seal was broken and fresh cool air filled my lungs. I did not know relief until I took such a breath.

The maman and a few others lifted me out and carefully wrapped me in three giant coats before laying me down. I looked around and realized that we were surrounded by ice. The ocean had frozen solid in the time I was gone.

The maman held a waterbag and a lantern to me, and I took a drink eagerly. Thi had broad shoulders and wore ruddy black kelp clothing all over hae body as if thi had found it and cut it haeself. The others all had lanterns to light their faces. They all looked to be from different places, but their clothes were the same.

"What a strange ship," thi said, staring at the charred remains of my three-day home. "No wonder you crashed. There's no rudder - couldn't steer."

I smiled for the first time in a long time, and looked deeply into the maman's eyes.

"Thank you... um?"

Thi said hae name with a smile. 

"Shinna."
