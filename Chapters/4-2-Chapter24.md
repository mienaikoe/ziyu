## Chapter 24

<!--
In this chapter, Pomri and Linyu set out in a small paddleboat for Heiko.

They don't have fog blocking them, but they are in the dark because of the obscura.

They also can't see underwater ships, like what Holrag would have. So the Holragi can spy on them and follow them to see what they're up to, maybe follow them back to Ulukoma to have a surprise attack in which they have to lock the door on Setre. The prologue illustrates a bloodied Setre, guilty for not helping Melna, paddling out to Liffa to save hae from a sinking capsule.

Anyway, tangent, this chapter shows them finding Laen-Laen and Pomri's saffa, Yub-yub, and Ginnu who can now see, but is exhausted and cold and doesn't know who thi is. However, thi knows the secret of the armory.

They would go straight back, but they are captured by Ramne <- Too Much Capturing!

They are driven into the desert

  "Are you afraid?"

  "No," she said. Her breathing was broken up by gentle strokes of a two-sided paddle. I tried my best to add my effort behind her, but Pomri's height and strength eclipsed my own. The smell of the ocean reminded me of Kipnu, and then of Melna.

  "What if we find her?"

  "Who?"

  "Melna."

  Pomri paused, distracted by the pain of the thought.

  "That's what we're here for isn't it?"

  My silence spoke in agreement. 
  
  After the shoreline of Ulukoma was barely visible, Pomri called for a break and I happily took my paddle into the boat. Soreness had crept into my arms and taken my breath while Pomri seemed hardly winded.

  "You ought to be stronger than me," she said, taking a drink from her canteen, "I'm nearly your nather's age."

  I finished catching my breath and my words and responded, I've never had great stamina."

  "Spend too much time with your wires."

  I was annoyed but didn't take it seriously. She meant well.

  My eyes wandered off toward the horizon to our right. There were faint signs of life in the distance, the ten thousand lantern boats of Rudjan calling before Ara, and nothing but shadows in twilight to the south. 

  "It's so dark," I said, looking for an answer.

  She paused to let the reality of it sink in. 

  "When Iâ€“," her voice cracked.

  "When I heard the boom... All I could think of was Melna. No one else mattered to me...in that moment."

  *What is she saying?*

  "Love is weird," I said, trying to break the awkward topic.

  "And now she's gone."

  "We don't know that. We're here to find out."

  "Right..." her words drifted, "Right."

  

  "Yes," she said, handing her canteen to me, "We've gone pretty far south, but I think this is far enough. We can turn toward the land here."
