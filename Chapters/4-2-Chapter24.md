## Chapter 24

<!--
In this chapter, Pomri and Linyu set out in a small paddleboat for Heiko.

They don't have fog blocking them, but they are in the dark because of the obscura.

They also can't see underwater ships, like what Holrag would have. So the Holragi can spy on them and follow them to see what they're up to, maybe follow them back to Ulukoma to have a surprise attack in which they have to lock the door on Setre. The prologue illustrates a bloodied Setre, guilty for not helping Melna, paddling out to Liffa to save hae from a sinking capsule.

Anyway, tangent, this chapter shows them finding Laen-Laen and Pomri's saffa, Yub-yub, and Ginnu who can now see, but is exhausted and cold and doesn't know who thi is. However, thi knows the secret of the armory.

They also need to discover Ramne's connection to Holrag

They would go straight back, but they are captured by Ramne <- Too Much Capturing!

Holragi is digging shelter in Heiko, because they need shelter from the coming nova that will send the Obscura to far off places.

They are driven into the desert

  "Are you worried?"

  "No," she said. Her breaths were punctuated by gentle strokes of a two-sided paddle. I tried my best to add my effort behind her, but Pomri's height and strength eclipsed my own. With each of her strokes I could feel the boat inch ahead and new air fill my lungs.

  "What if we find her?"

  Pomri paused, distracted.

  "That's what we're here for isn't it?"

  I let my silence agree.

  There was a guilt I carried onto the boat, made me turn around and look back to the shoreline of Ulukoma as it sank under waves and horizon. I did not long for my nather, but the waves made me miss that home.

  Presently, Kipnu came to my mind, then Melna. I imagined them side by side in the water, their eyes open, unmoving. Their spirits reached out, draped in water. They played in our wake, climbed the hull, hung from our paddles. But the gaze turned something inside of me. Those vacant eyes, peering into the void from their pale frightened faces, the water covering them just so. And at once I was among them in that viscous ether-ocean, bubbles and froth tickling my skin, my body unmoving and my eyes locked into that same vacant stare.

  "Oy! Kaln! Are you paddling?"

  "Sorry," I said hurriedly, and snapped out of my trance.

  We paddled until a sliver of the remaining light of Ara peeked through the horizon, then Pomri called for a break and I happily took my paddle into the boat.

  "You ought to be stronger than me," she said, hardly winded, "I'm nearly your nather's age."

  I finished catching my wits and responded, "I've never had great stamina."

  "Spend too much time with those wires."

  I was annoyed but I didn't take it seriously. She meant well.

  My eyes wandered off toward the horizon to our right. There were faint signs of life in the distance, the ten thousand lantern boats of Rudjan calling to the north. And to the south, a towering shadow, darker than the dusk that hung everywhere else, hanging still in the twilight above where Heiko center should be.

  "It's so dark," I said, looking for an answer.

  She paused to absorb the reality that came with that cloud.

  "When Iâ€“," her voice cracked.

  "When I heard the boom... All I could think of... was Melna. Nothing else... Nothing else mattered to me in that moment."

  *What is she saying?*

  "Love is weird like that," I said, trying to break the mood.

  But she sustained it, "Love. There were times where," she exhaled as if to simper, remembering something, "It must have come to that."

  I placed my hand on her back, letting her fix time for a moment of solace. I added no more ponderance than deserved it.

  "Love is why we're out here in the cold. To give closure to the ones that stayed behind. To the ones who didn't get to say goodbye."

  "Right..." her words drifted and made room for calm, "Right."

  She removed her canteen and handed it to me, and I took it eagerly.

  "We've gone pretty far south," she said, "but I think this is far enough. We don't want to get caught by some Holragi troop headed for the epicenter. If we turn toward Ara here, we can find our landing somewhere north of the city."

  Ara. I didn't give it much thought before; it was a clock, a direction, a fixture in the background. But now every one of its last rays had become precious warmth. I wondered how we would find our orientation after Ara was completely shrouded. Would the waves still swell, and the wind still gust? Maybe orientation wouldn't matter in the dark.

  "Linyu," she tapped my shoulder to wake me from my daydream. "Shall we go?"

  I nodded and she turned back forward to resume her posture.

  She told me over her shoulder, "we're entering a dangerous place. There may be looters or Holragi soldiers searching for survivors. The land itself may be fragile and broken. You'll have to keep your wits about you at all times."

  "Got it," I said. *I hope I do.*

  "We have about two va'na of paddling left. Can you make it?"

  "I'll try."

  "Push through if you can. The time we have to rescue people is wearing thin."

  My resolve was affirmed with a nod. There was no turning back.

  A firm command from Pomri, and we took up our paddles again, resuming the slow cadence of wood against the water.

  "I hear waves hitting land. Over there."

  She pointed to the right with her nose, and I paused to listen closer. *Resonance.*

  "A cove," I said, to her surprise, "Maybe we can find cover for our boat."

  Pomri stopped paddling and looked back at me. "How could you possibly?.." She asked with a quizzical look.

  But she didn't wait for me to respond, just shook her head in disbelief, and then resumed her paddling. I wasn't sure how to feel about it.

  <!-- They find Ginnu/not-Ginnu in the cove -->
