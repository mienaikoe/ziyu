## Chapter 24

<!--
In this chapter, Pomri and Linyu set out in a small paddleboat for Heiko.

They don't have fog blocking them, but they are in the dark because of the obscura.

They also can't see underwater ships, like what Holrag would have. So the Holragi can spy on them and follow them to see what they're up to, maybe follow them back to Ulukoma to have a surprise attack in which they have to lock the door on Setre. The prologue illustrates a bloodied Setre, guilty for not helping Melna, paddling out to Liffa to save hae from a sinking capsule.

Anyway, tangent, this chapter shows them finding Laen-Laen and Pomri's saffa, Yub-yub, and Ginnu who can now see, but is exhausted and cold and doesn't know who thi is. However, thi knows the secret of the armory.

They also need to discover Ramne's connection to Holrag

They would go straight back, but they are captured by Ramne <- Too Much Capturing!

Holragi is digging shelter in Heiko, because they need shelter from the coming nova that will send the Obscura to far off places.

They are driven into the desert

"Are you worried?"

"No," she said. Their breaths were punctuated by gentle strokes of a two-sided paddle. With each one I could feel the boat inch ahead and new air fill my lungs. Behind the both of them I added my effort, trying to keep up with Pomri, but her height and strength eclipsed my own.

"What if we find her?"

Pomri paused, distracted.

"That's what we're here for isn't it?"

My silence agreed.

There was a certain guilt I carried onto the boat. The kind of guilt that fills your belly with vines, pretangled and on fire. A guilt that made me turn around and look back to the shoreline of Ulukoma as it sank under waves and horizon. I did not long for my nather in particular. Nor for anyone back there. But the waves and the salty air made me miss that home.

Presently, Kipnu came to my mind, then Melna. I imagined them side by side in the water, their eyes open, unmoving. Their spirits reached out, draped in water. They played in our wake, climbed the hull, hung from our paddles. But the gaze turned something inside of me. Those vacant eyes, peering into the void from their pale frightened faces, the water covering them just so. And at once I was among them in that viscous ether-ocean with the bubbles and froth tickling my skin, my body unmoving and my eyes locked into that same vacant stare.

"Oi! Kaln! You paddling or napping?" she asked me.

"Sorry," I said hurriedly, and snapped out of my trance.

We paddled until a sliver of the remaining light of Ara peeked through the horizon, then Pomri called for a break and we happily took our paddles into the boat.

"You ought to be stronger than me," she said to me, hardly winded, "kaln like you has unlimited energy."

I finished catching my breath and responded, "I'm not tall enough."

"Bah barely an arm between us," she balked, "You spend too much time with those wires, 's what I think"

I was annoyed but I didn't take it seriously. She meant well.

My eyes wandered off toward the horizon to our right. There were faint signs of life in the distance, the ten thousand lantern boats of Rudjan calling to the north. And to the south, a towering shadow, darker than the dusk that hung everywhere else, hanging still in the twilight above where Heiko center should be.

"It's so dark," I said, looking for an answer.

We paused to absorb the reality that came with that cloud.

"When Iâ€“," her voice cracked.

"When I heard the explosions... paddling my heart out in the thick fog... All I could think of... was Melna. Nothing else... Nothing else mattered to me in that moment."

*What is she saying?*

"Love is weird like that," I said, trying to break the mood.

But she sustained it, "Love. There were times where," she exhaled as if to simper, remembering something, "It must have come to that."

I placed my hand on her back, letting her fix time for a moment of solace. I added no more ponderance than deserved it.

"Love is why we're out here in the cold. To give closure to the ones that stayed behind. To the ones who didn't get to say goodbye."

"Right..." her words drifted and made room for calm, "Right."

She removed her canteen and handed it to me, and I took it eagerly.

"We've gone pretty far south," she said, "but I think this is far enough. We don't want to get caught by some Holragi troop headed for the epicenter. If we turn toward Ara here, we can find our landing somewhere north of the city."

Ara. I didn't give it much thought before; it was a clock, a direction, a fixture in the background. But now every one of its last rays had become precious warmth. I wondered how we would find our orientation after Ara was completely shrouded. Would the waves still swell, and the wind still gust? Maybe orientation wouldn't matter in the dark.

"Linyu," she tapped my shoulder to wake me from my daydream. "Shall we go?"

I nodded and she turned back forward to resume her posture.

She told me over her shoulder, "we're entering a dangerous place. There may be looters or Holragi soldiers searching for survivors. The land itself may be fragile and broken. You'll have to keep your wits about you at all times."

"Got it," I said. *I hope I do.*

"We have about two va'na of paddling left. Can you make it?"

"I'll try."

"Push through if you can. The time we have to rescue people is wearing thin."

My resolve was affirmed with a nod. There was no turning back.

A firm command from Pomri, and we took up our paddles again, resuming the slow cadence of wood against the water.

"Waves," I said, "Hitting land. Over there."

I pointed to the right just in Pomri's view, and she paused to listen closer. *Resonance.*

"A cove," I said, to her surprise, "We can find cover for our boat."

Pomri asked out loud, "How could you possibly?.."

But she didn't wait for me to respond, just shook her head in disbelief, and resumed her paddling.

The opening of the cove was wide and tall enough for a whole freighter. It opened to the ocean like the mouth of a colossus slowly swallowing us whole. It sent a shudder through me and my arms grew weak, but Pomri stilled me. "Aey-Aey," she said confidently, and my muscles responded with the last reserves of their strength. We had gone just a few tens of paces in and the water had died down, and now Pomri began to reach with her paddle to find land in any direction. I followed her lead despite my shortness, but neither of us had found anything.

"Oi, let's head toward the wall to the left," she said, "This place is big."

We turned and paddled softly, but it didn't take long for us to hit ground. The boat slid ashore onto a pebble jetty with a loud *shhhh-ch*, and stopped abruptly. Pomri wasted no time.

"Let's go," she said, already off the boat, and I instinctively clambered to the front, trying to keep my balance.

"Aye. I'm coming," I said.

Before I could set foot on the ground, I heard a call echoing from a position both near and far, "Hello?". I stopped in my tracks, and tried to find the source of the sound. Pomri was equally startled and moved closer to hold my hand.

"Who's there?!" she asked.

*That voice...*

At the edge of the outside light, I could see two giant silhouettes of saffas. *The noise is coming from there, but...*

I shouted, "Stay back! We are armed."

In front of the silhouettes, another noise echoed off the walls of the cove. This time it was a familiar tinkling sound: a sound that had become an annoyance through the journey to Rudjan, but stuck so heavily in my mind. Then, suddenly, the saffas made a series of loud "Woop!" sounds, and rushed past the maman toward us.

Thi said, "Laen! Wait!"

Pomri stood her ground in front of me, but softened once she put the name and the sound together. We were greeted by a pair of big fuzzy faces and the air of stale fish.

"Laen-Laen!" I cried and wrapped my arms halfway around his neck. I was elated to have my friend back. Pomri embraced with Boon, and whispered quietly to her, but then moved forward to confront the maman.

"Thank you for keeping our saffas safe. Who are you?"

The maman walked closer to us and answered,

"The maman that came before me was named Ginnu."

I interjected, excitedly, "Ginnu? Came before? But you..."

"I am *Annui*, without a name."

"How did you come to have Melna's pendant, Annui?" asked Pomri.

Thi gasped, "You know Melna?"

We shared a moment of silence, realizing that we ought to regroup in the light.

They find Ginnu/not-Ginnu in the cove.
She shows them Melna's and Kipnu's pendants as a token of trust.
