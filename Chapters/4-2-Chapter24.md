## Chapter 24

<!--
In this chapter, Pomri and Linyu set out in a small paddleboat for Heiko.

They don't have fog blocking them, but they are in the dark because of the obscura.

They also can't see underwater ships, like what Holrag would have. So the Holragi can spy on them and follow them to see what they're up to, maybe follow them back to Ulukoma to have a surprise attack in which they have to lock the door on Setre. The prologue illustrates a bloodied Setre, guilty for not helping Melna, paddling out to Liffa to save hae from a sinking capsule.

Anyway, tangent, this chapter shows them finding Laen-Laen and Pomri's saffa, Yub-yub, and Ginnu who can now see, but is exhausted and cold and doesn't know who thi is. However, thi knows the secret of the armory.

They also need to discover Ramne's connection to Holrag

They would go straight back, but they are captured by Ramne <- Too Much Capturing!

Holragi is digging shelter in Heiko, because they need shelter from the coming nova that will send the Obscura to far off places.

They are driven into the desert

  "Are you afraid?"

  "No," she said. Her breathing was broken up by gentle strokes of a two-sided paddle. I tried my best to add my effort behind her, but Pomri's height and strength eclipsed my own. With each of her strokes I could feel the boat inch ahead and new wind fill my lungs. The ocean reminded me of Kipnu, and then of Melna.

  "What if we find her?"

  Pomri paused, distracted by the pain of the thought.

  "That's what we're here for isn't it?"

  I let my silence agree.
  
  There was a certain guilt I carried onto the boat, made me turn around and look back to the shoreline of Ulukoma as it sank under waves and horizon. I paddled until I saw nothing but the ocean, and called out for a break. Pomri obliged and I happily took my paddle into the boat. I do not know if it was soreness or worry that crept into my arms and took my strength but it clung to me like dew or mist and frothed as I struggled in its viscosity.

  "You ought to be stronger than me," she said, hardly winded, "I'm nearly your nather's age."

  I finished catching my breath and responded, "I've never had great stamina."

  "Spend too much time with those wires."

  I was annoyed but I didn't take it seriously. She meant well.

  My eyes wandered off toward the horizon to our right. There were faint signs of life in the distance, the ten thousand lantern boats of Rudjan calling before Ara, and nothing but a towering shadow, hanging still in the twilight above where Heiko center should be. 

  "It's so dark," I said, looking for an answer.

  She paused to absorb the reality of the shadow 

  "When Iâ€“," her voice cracked.

  "When I heard the boom... All I could think of was Melna. No one else mattered to me...in that moment."

  *What is she saying?*

  "Love is weird," I said, trying to break the mood.

  But she sustained, "And now she's gone."

  "We don't know that. We're here to find out what happened."

  "Right..." her words drifted, "Right."

  She handed her canteen to me, said "We've gone pretty far south, but I think this is far enough. We don't want to get caught by some Holragi troop that stuck behind at the harbor. We can turn toward Ara here, find our landing somewhere north of the city."

  Ara. It seemed so simple before to use it for direction. I wondered how we would find our orientation if Ara was completely shrouded. Would the waves still swell, and the wind still gust? Maybe orientation wouldn't matter in the dark.

  "Linyu," she tapped my shoulder to wake me from my daydream. "I need you to stay alert from this point on, okay? We're entering a dangerous place. There may be looters or Holragi soldiers searching for survivors. The land itself may be fragile and broken. You'll have to keep your wits about you at all times."

  "Got it," I said. *I hope I do.*

  "We have about two va'na of paddling left. Can you make it?"

  "I'll try."

  "Push through if you can. The time we have to rescue people is wearing thin."

  With a nod, my resolve was affirmed. We've put a lot at risk for one reason and we weren't about to turn back for nothing.

  With a firm command, we took up our paddles again and resumed the slow cadence of pushing through the water.
