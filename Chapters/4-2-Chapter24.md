## Chapter 24

<!--
In this chapter, Pomri and Linyu set out in a small paddleboat for Heiko.

They don't have fog blocking them, but they are in the dark because of the obscura.

They also can't see underwater ships, like what Holrag would have. So the Holragi can spy on them and follow them to see what they're up to, maybe follow them back to Ulukoma to have a surprise attack in which they have to lock the door on Setre. The prologue illustrates a bloodied Setre, guilty for not helping Melna, paddling out to Liffa to save hae from a sinking capsule.

Anyway, tangent, this chapter shows them finding Laen-Laen and Pomri's saffa, Yub-yub, and Ginnu who can now see, but is exhausted and cold and doesn't know who thi is. However, thi knows the secret of the armory.

They also need to discover Ramne's connection to Holrag

They would go straight back, but they are captured by Ramne <- Too Much Capturing!

Holragi is digging shelter in Heiko, because they need shelter from the coming nova that will send the Obscura to far off places.

They are driven into the desert

"Are you worried?"

"No," she said. Their breaths were punctuated by gentle strokes of a two-sided paddle. With each one I could feel the boat inch ahead and new air fill my lungs. I sat behind, adding  my effort and trying to keep up with Pomri, but her height and strength eclipsed my own.

"What if we find her?"

Pomri paused, distracted.

"That's what we're here for isn't it?"

My silence agreed.

There was a certain guilt I carried onto the boat. The kind of guilt that fills your belly with vines, pretangled and on fire. A guilt that made me turn around and look back to the shoreline of Ulukoma as it sank under waves and horizon. I did not long for my nather in particular. Nor for anyone back there. But the waves and the salty air made me miss that home.

Presently, Kipnu came to my mind, then Melna. I imagined them side by side in the water, their eyes open, unmoving. Their spirits reached out, draped in water. They played in our wake, climbed the hull, hung from our paddles. But the gaze turned something inside of me. Those vacant eyes, peering into the void from their pale faces, the water covering them just so. And at once I was among them in that viscous ether-ocean with the bubbles and froth tickling my skin, my body unmoving and my eyes locked in that same vacant stare.

"Oi! Kaln! You paddling or napping?" she asked me.

"Sorry," I said hurriedly, and snapped out of my trance.

We paddled until a sliver of the remaining light of Ara peeked through the horizon, then Pomri called for a break and we happily took our paddles into the boat.

"You ought to be stronger than me," she said to me, hardly winded, "kaln like you has unlimited energy."

I finished catching my breath and responded, "I'm not tall enough."

"Bah barely an arm between us," she balked, "You spend too much time with those wires, 's what I think"

I was annoyed but I didn't take it seriously. She meant well.

My eyes wandered off toward the horizon to our right. There were faint signs of life in the distance, the ten thousand lantern boats of Rudjan calling to the north. And to the south, a towering shadow, darker than the dusk that hung everywhere else, hanging still in the twilight above where Heiko center should be.

"It's so dark," I said, looking for an answer.

We paused to absorb the reality that came with that cloud.

"When I–," her voice cracked.

"When I heard the explosions... paddling my heart out in the thick fog... All I could think of... was Melna. Nothing else... Nothing else mattered to me in that moment."

My mind recalled the moment she spoke of. I knew Melna had accomplished her goal. I knew that she wouldn't have had it any other way. But I thought of no one but Laen-Laen.

"Love is weird like that," I said. I tried to break the dark mood, but secretly, I also felt it.

But she sustained it, "Love," she exhaled as if to simper, stuck in some moment from the past, "There were times... where it must have come to that."

I placed my hand on her back, letting her fix time for a moment of solace. I added no more pondering than deserved it.

"Love is why we're out here in the cold. To give closure to the ones that stayed behind. To the ones who didn't get to say goodbye."

"Right..." her words drifted and made room for calm, "Right."

She removed her canteen and handed it to me, and I took it eagerly.

"We've gone pretty far south," she said, "but I think this is far enough. We don't want to get caught by some Holragi troop headed for the epicenter. If we turn toward Ara here, we can find our landing somewhere north of the city."

Ara. I didn't give it much thought before; it was a clock, a direction, a fixture in the background. But now every one of its last rays had become precious warmth. I wondered how we would find our orientation after Ara was completely shrouded. Would the waves still swell, and the wind still gust? Maybe orientation wouldn't matter in the dark.

"Linyu," she tapped my shoulder to wake me from my daydream. "Shall we go?"

I nodded and she turned back forward to resume her posture.

She told me over her shoulder, "we're entering a dangerous place. There may be looters or Holragi soldiers searching for survivors. The land itself may be fragile and broken. You'll have to keep your wits about you at all times."

"Got it," I said. *I hope I do.*

"We have about two va'na of paddling left. Can you make it?"

"I'll try."

"Push through if you can. The time we have to rescue people is wearing thin."

My resolve was affirmed with a nod. There was no turning back.

A firm command from Pomri, and we took up our paddles again, resuming the slow cadence of wood against the water.

"Waves," I said, "Hitting land. Over there."

I pointed to the right just in Pomri's view, and she paused to listen closer. *Resonance.*

"A cove," I said, to her surprise, "We can find cover for our boat."

Pomri asked out loud, "How could you possibly?.."

But she didn't wait for me to respond, just shook her head in disbelief, and resumed her paddling.

The opening of the cove was wide and tall enough for a whole freighter. It opened to the ocean like the mouth of a colossus slowly swallowing us whole. It sent a shudder through me and my arms grew weak, but Pomri stilled me. "Aey-Aey," she said confidently, and my muscles responded with the last reserves of their strength. We had gone just a few tens of paces in and the water had died down, and now Pomri began to reach with her paddle to find land in any direction. I followed her lead despite my shortness, but neither of us had found anything.

"Oi, let's head toward the wall to the left," she said, "This place is big."

We turned and paddled softly, but it didn't take long for us to hit ground. The boat slid ashore onto a sand-and-pebble jetty with a loud *shhhh-ch*, and stopped abruptly. Pomri wasted no time.

"Let's go," she said, already off the boat, and I instinctively clambered to the front, trying to keep my balance.

"Aye. I'm coming," I said.

Before I could set foot on the ground, I heard movement: footsteps on pebbles echoing from every wall. I stopped in my tracks to listen. They weren't deliberate and quick like a bandit or an assassin – more uncontrolled, and barely hanging on. Pomri was equally startled and moved closer to hold me back. With a swift gesture, she held her hand out in front of my mouth mouth, a command to stay quiet.

At the edge of the outside light, I saw two giant silhouettes of saffas, perched at the mouth of the cove and looking in just out of the light. But somewhere between the saffas and us, that cadence of slow footsteps rattled off the walls. If it were just a throngia, we could push the boat off and paddle away. But a saffa can swim and run much faster than we could ever hope to paddle or run.

Pomri began to approach, to put distance between me and the walking sound. She was deliberately slow and silent. Only taking a step with each wave that boomed into the mouth.

But then the footsteps stopped with a larger thud, as if the mysterious person had plopped all their body weight on the ground. *We are intruders here.*

Once she was close enough, Pomri spoke up, "We don't mean any-," but before she could finish, the person in the dark had found Pomri and held a long wooden pole to her chest. She took a step back and tried to force the pole away, but it had disappeared into the darkness as the shadow fled back toward the saffas. I ran after, evading Pomri's hands and protests not to go. *This isn't an enemy, It can't be.*

The stranger passed between the saffas, and out of the cove where the remaining Ara-light shone against hae back. I was aghast at hae feeble figure, hydroderm swollen with cold and sunken with hunger. But before I could reach hae, one of the saffas had turned and picked hae up, while the other stood ground guarding their getaway. Through the growling and shuffling of feet, I heard a sound I'd not expected to hear: the ringing jingles of a binding pendant as it rocked this way and that around the saffa's neck. And then I saw him – the thick fur and the big ears and the myriad different mannerisms that were unmistakable for anyone else but my best friend.

"Laen! You're alive!"

He hesitated, judging the voice against my motion, but then he sniffed a little and he at once he knew. He instantly let out a loud "Woop!" and rushed toward me with his big fuzzy face and his breath of stale fish. I hugged him warmly at his neck and he plopped an ear on my head while he coo'd his relief.

Behind, Pomri cried out in an exhausted voice, "Laen? Is it really you?"

But Pomri was not one to celebrate before it was due. She asked him, "Laen, who is that maman?", and he replied with an undulating "wOOooOOoo", a sound of sorrow, not of fear. I took a look at the pendant that was tied up in his chin fur and felt for its telltale shapes and edges. It felt familiar in my fingers, much like Kipnu's did upon my own neck.

"Whoever thi is," I said, "Thi knows Melna."

"Then I bet that other saffa is Boon," she said.

After a pause, she called us to action again. "Come, let's get out of this cove."

We followed Laen out onto beach where the light seemed brighter than before, a trick of the eyes. The smell of soot and ash hung on the air, a harbinger of the dark cloud that towered over Heiko. High above, it lofted into the coldwinds and hotwinds, spreading both toward and away from Ara in shades of gray ochre. Perhaps bits of it lifted into stellar space, reaching out for Liffa. But there we stood, at that imperceptable edge between dark and light, life and death, and we were in it.

"We'll lose our bearings in this dust," said Pomri, "Let's head to the road."

********

Our feet took us to the traveling path and we soon reached the 1 lao'ka marking rock where we got our bearings. While Pomri and I looked for tracks, Laen had chosen a spot at the edge of the path, trying to find warmth in the thin light. He had begun to sneeze a bit and I looked back toward him, concerned.

"Cover your face," she told me, holding a shawl. I wrapped the shawl over myself and waited for her to do the same with a piece of fabric ripped from her coat. I couldn't help but look at Laen again.

"I don't have anything that could protect him," Pomri explained, "He'll have to stay here."

"I know... I just wanted to say goodbye."

"Make it quick. We still have quite a hike before we reach the pier."

I took the shawl from her hands and walked over to Laen with his ears perked up in anticipation. His gaze was trained upon me, yearning for answers that I couldn't find the words to explain.

From a satchel, I pulled a morsel of roasted seaweed I had brought from home and offered it to him.

"You hungry?"

He wasn't, but he took it gently out of respect and placed it on his left paw for later.

"WoOoo," he said in a grateful tone.

I found the spot on his back where he loved to be scratched and ran my fingers through his fur. His reflexes shook him with satisfaction. Then I stopped and laid my head and hands against him and he rested his head on the ground and tilted it to the side to better hear me.

"I'm so glad we found you, Laen."

He didn't respond, just took in the moment.

"Now... we have to go on, and it's too dangerous for you to come with us."

I spoke with a heavy heart, but Laen seemed to already know. He held his eyes open just enough to see me and closed enough to enjoy our time together peacefully.

"You have to take care of yourself now, okay? Your home is..."

I paused to stop my words and Laen made a long sigh, feeling the weight of them anyway.

"Maybe you'll find Boon and that maman again. Or maybe we'll be back soon and then you can stay with us. In Ulukoma."

His ears perked up a little bit more, in calm excitement at the thought of a new home.

"You'll have lots of fish. And that pohua stuff that grows in the dark. I know you like that."

"oomm," he said with his mouth closed.

*What will you do now?*, I wondered. *What will I do?*

My face flushed in sadness and I laid back against him, putting the future out of my mind. I took one look at Melna's pendant, still twisted and tangled in his fur. I put Kipnu's up to it as well, listening to them jingle together. And then a thought came over me, and I pulled the listener off of my right ear. With a careful braiding of metal wire and tufts of fur, I braided in the listener just below his ear, making sure it wasn't so close as to damage his hearing.

"The wind speaks," I whispered to him.

"Ooo-Ooo," he responded. He didn't know the words, but that was okay.

"Oi, kaln," Pomri called, "It's safe for us to head in now. Let's go!"

"Coming!"

"I love you Laen," I said solemnly to him before I left.

He replied with a proper lick.
