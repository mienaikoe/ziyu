## Prologue

You cannot hear the first note of a ziyu tree's song. There is no grand entrance or catchy hook. No meandering conversation between a point and its counter. You may recognize the sound in the still of the morning, when the dew is set and a gentle breeze whisps across your brow, only it's always been there and you can't place when it began, exactly. Then the light of our star, Ara, brings day to the land and every leaf is full and singing, their harmonies intertwined in that wonderous complexity reserved to the wit of nature.

It was within this enchantment of nature that I was born. Among its leaves and stems and branches, I made my first cry to the world and the world calmed me with its song. My nather used to tell me how beautiful it was to hold me for the first time. I still imagine it when I come here in the morning; her body overcome with relief, sleeping peacefully against the soft treebark while I lay in her arms, brushed by her windswept hair, bathed in the pale light of Ara.

Heiko tradition says that it's good luck to be born under a ziyu's song. But I've never felt particularly blessed. I was born a maman, the lowest of the three sexes in both height and station. My mother was a farmer, and my family expected me to become a mother just like hae. As a child I tilled the soil and harvested pohua, but at night I read all that I could by the light of my small anomin lantern. I used to wonder why my mother never caught me.

<!--
When Thimlu came to take me on as an apprentice at the observatory, I didn't have to think. I studied what I could for a while, but destiny clawed me back with the passing of my mother. Hae farm, and all of the responsibilities and expectations that our community imposed upon it, had fallen upon me.

Once, I fell in love with a man and a woman that I doted on in a drunken stupor and I was so afraid of love that I joined with them as soon as I could so I would never have to fall again. Perhaps it's not that I was afraid. I merely preferred the company of my thoughts to that of people. Adventure was left to the books I read and whatever drama our saffa gets into. -->

Though they had passed, my parents' presence remained in this place. My mother's hands in the soil, my nather's strength in the tree, my father's voice in the wind. They welcomed me back with their arms stretched wide like the branches of the ziyu curling toward Ara. "I'm here!" I'd say, and a gentle sigh flitted against my cheek: relief that I had made it another year. I'd settle in against the ziyu's trunk and its song would start to lift.

But this day, it was silent.
