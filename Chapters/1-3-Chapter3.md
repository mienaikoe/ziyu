## Chapter 3

The late morning light was just enough for me to see while I dashed to Laen-Laen's den just outside the back door. He was small for a Saffa, but at twelve times my own weight, he had more than enough strength to fit both Jathi and me.

"Laen-Laen, good morning!" I greeted him and he gave out a whoop as he woke up from his half-nap. "You're still asleep, Laen?"

A loud and wavering "Ooooo" filled the room as he stretched and yawned in my face.

"Hey grass-breath, I've got a job for you. Can you take me to Heiko central?"

He snorted his disapproval with his fuzzy ears turned backward.

"We can stop by Gilli's and get a cake."

"Oop-oop!" He chittered. His head perked up as if Gilli was his favorite person in the whole world.

"There we go. Now let's get you ready."

I took a soft linen blanket from the wall and laid it across Laen's back, then led him down the alley toward the front gate where Jathi was waiting for me.

I remembered how Jathi and I used to walk with Laen along the coastline in the fog of morning. We'd finish the long night shifts working together at the observatory and take our breaks playing in the water or getting lost in the gray abyss until the fog lifted. Even though we'd stayed up all night, we were never tired when we were together. Truthfully, I was glad to see his face at my door.

"Didn't think we would be doing this again," he said, "The three of us on a morning adventure."

"Adventure?" I said surprised. "It's just a stop by the conduit."

"Adventures come in all shapes in sizes. Even a moment can be an adventure."

I smiled, satisfied to have an unexpected moment of adventure with an old friend.

The winds were slowly picking up while we rode down the long, packed-clay road from my home toward the center of town. All above us, the deep blue of the sky rose from Ulu like a giant wave from the ocean, and faded into the golden splendor of Ara. Trails of wispy clouds hung in the middle like the puffy fingers of a dark hand reaching for the crown of twilight.

I wondered what was happening up there. As a child, I learned that observers long ago discovered that Palinan was orbiting Ara in a big ellipse[^1], which gives us the day and the night times, the high tides and the low. And observer Thimlu told me that he had seen red stars very far away, in those patches of sky where the dark was steady and the clouds were few. How far? He couldn't be certain. But he knew they were much further than even a train could reach in our lifetimes. I wondered if those stars could die like we did, or if they had always been there like little holes in the blanket of the sky.

[^1]: A day on Palinan takes approximately 3½ earth days.

At the end of the path, we turned a corner and crossed the train line just after the station, onto a side street into town. It was rather peaceful, as the first meal time had just passed into rest time. We reached the office of the conduit and quickly hopped off of Laen. I gave him a thankful pat on the neck and he replied with a small cooing of acknowledgement.

"Now, don't go anywhere," Jathi commanded. But Laen looked back at him with a puzzled face.

I laughed at him and said, "He's not going anywhere. I'm his ticket to cakes." Laen's face perked up at the word.

A man stood against the doorway, dressed in a simple, but neatly folded kelpen coat in gray and blue. His eyes and hands wore the creases of work, but not of age. He turned to face us and I froze, staring at his familiar face like a friend forgotten, piecing together the time that stood between now and our last memory.

"Aey, lad," said the man as he glanced at Jathi, "You forgot to clean the lenses. And where is Meln-... my stars." He gasped as he looked toward the maman beyond his apprentice. "Liffa... 's that you?" he asked.

"Thimlu," I said, trying to hold my joy to a sociable level. "It's been forever."

"My it has," he said. "Your eyes... have you...?"

"Taken on the haze?" I asked. "No. It's temporary, happens when working with pohua. I can see just fine."

"Aey, Good. You do well 'n keep 'em that way. There's still an opening at the observatory for when I leave. You actually listened to me back then, unlike Jathi here. Couldn't teach him a damn thing until you left. If Kipnu hadn't already caught Melna's eye, I would have sent you two to get hitched with her."

Jathi's cheeks went red, and he protested, "Thimlu! You can't say that."

"Bah. Observers are sworn to observe, and the two of you are plan as day." Thimlu shifted and started walking back into the office as Jathi and I nervously dodged glances. "Anyway, let's get down to business. Where's Melna?"

Jathi responded eagerly. "There's been a bit of a snag. Melna's already left."

"Well that's not good..." he responded coldly. "'s not good at all."

"Were you able to reach anyone?" Jathi asked.

"I tried the observatories in Holrag and Seroa, and they're both unresponsive. Makes sense, it's the middle of mid-day sleep."

"I'll try Melna's personal line," Jathi said with a chipper voice.

Jathi set himself at the phone desk and set a note flat upon the table in front of him. There was no space for two near him, so I stood closer to the door. I wondered where the usual operator slept during mid-day. It was quite a small building in terms of footprint, but ceiling was far above us, making room for a towering ordered nest of tarred metallic wires and rails. They were dense enough, I imagined, for someone to sleep directly on them, but there wasn't a person in sight.

Jathi began. "Shaki Conduit, This is Heiko Conduit."

A couple other callers delivered a message over the line, but the Shaki conduit did not respond. He waited a tick and then repeated.

"Shaki Conduit, This is-"

"Heiko, this is Shaki. Please remember to speak in your turn."

Jathi switched to his authoritative voice. "Shaki, we are requesting priority. This is an urgent call to the senate."

There was silence for a moment as all of the operators paused to listen in.

"Heiko, which conduit in the senate are you requesting connection to?"

"The Heiko fidelant's private conduit, please."

The conduit operator paused. "I assume you have a damn good reason for that."

"Yes, I do. It's a message pertaining to today's assembly."

There was a sigh of annoyance on the line befor ethe operator said, "Transferring you to Heiko Senate. Please wait a moment."

I took the moment to move closer to the two of them at the desk. Jathi was busy reading over the paper again and reciting what he was going to say. I glanced at it but couldn't read the writing from my distance. There was a scribbled drawing of a circle and some dots on it, but I couldn't make out what they were.

Thimlu had seen me eyeing the paper and held me back from getting closer. "It's best if you didn't read it," he said.

The line opened and an unenthused woman spoke, "Conduit of the Heiko Senate, Assistant Pomri."

"Pomri, I have an urgent message for Melna."

"Jathi? By Ara, don't you ever sleep? It's the middle of first nap."

"We've found something at the observatory. It was too important for sleep."

"Well, I'm afraid you're too late," she said. "Melna is in assembly."

"When will she be out?"

"Who's to say? It could take the whole day."

"This message is of utmost importance. It will surely be something she wants to bring to vote. Is there anyone else you can tell?"

"It's unlawful to interrupt the assembly," she responded in a defeated tone as if she'd tried this before.

"Surely you can make an exception for an urgent matter."

"And I would surely be imprisoned for it."

He huffed in frustration burying his face in his hand. "Pomri," he replied with pessimism. "Even if there is a law against interrupting the assembly, a magistrate would surely look the other way at sentencing."

"You ever been to Shaki?" she asked with a patronizing tone.

He hesitated, "Why does that matter?"

"Then you wouldn't understand. The whole city would know about it before I could even say a word. A magistrate would never back down from something that public."

"Pomri, trust me," he said, gravity in his voice. "_This can't wait_."

She hesitated for a moment, as if surprised. "Look, if you want this so bad, come to Shaki and tell her yourself. I'm not getting tossed in the ocean over a message."

"You're asking me to come to the senate? What, so... so I can be the one to do it instead of you?"

"Sorry I can't do more, kid. The law is everything here, but at least we can grumble about it. Anyway, I won't stop you from doing whatever as long as you don't put Melna in hot water."

He sighed, "Yea. I'll think about it."

"Oh," she interjected. "And if you do swing by bring me a cake from Gilli's, would ya?"

He lifted his finger from the transmittance button. "Really? A cake?" he asked the static.

Thimlu grumbled in frustration, "What a time to be stuck in deliberation."

There was a moment of silent thought between the two of them, but I'd already decided what to do. "I'll go," I said.

Jathi shot me a glance. "What are you talking about?" he asked.

"I'll interrupt the senate," I said. Thimlu chuckled, but Jathi was unamused.

"You heard Pomri," said Jathi. "You'll be sent to Ulukoma."

Thimlu smirked at me and said, "You've got guts, I'll give you that. Magistrate's a coin toss. On one hand, they get off on sending people to Ulukoma. On the other hand, they might be terrified of sending away the person who delivered a message like this."

Jathi shouted back at him, "No! Ulukoma could get hae killed. I can't risk that." I was astonished. Jathi was always so calm and now he was the most animated I had ever seen him. He sighed and sat back, turning it over in his head while I rose from the desk and paced the floor between the two of them, pausing to admire the old wood floor that had heard countless messages of great significance in the ever-changing tides of time.

Jathi stood up and spoke in a stoic tone. "I'll do it", he said.

"Like hell you will," Thimlu interjected. "We've got a lot of work to do."

But Jathi kept up his argument, "It's unfair to ask Liffa to do our job for us. Keeping an open line with fidelant is _our_ duty is observers."

Thimlu hesitated, turning his head to me with a smirk on his face. "Liffa... what if I told you there was an opening in–."

"–Yes!", I said too early. "I mean, uh... If it would please the observers."

Thimlu stood up and from his jacket, he produced a small disc of brass with an ornate engraving carved into it.

"Heiko Observatory - Liffa um Heiko," I said aloud. "You've kept this with you for so long."

"I've been waiting for the right moment. And well, this one's about as close as we'll get. Welcome to the club," he said.

I was giddy, taking the disc from his hand and moving my fingers across its surface. I'd longed for this moment for such a long time. It was far from the formal ceremonious event than I'd imagined, but I didn't mind. I didn't study under Thimlu for the vanity of the job.

Jathi stood behind the table and seemed defeated. His eyes locked with mine and knew that I would not be moved. "I'll make Pomri get you out of there even if I have to bring her a hundred cakes. I've got your back no matter what."

"Don't worry about me," I told him, my hand reaching mindlessly for his. "Whatever they have planned, I can handle it."

I gathered my bag onto my shoulders, and stood near the doorway as they approached me to bid me farewell. Thimlu held the message in his hand and put it in mine, muttering to me, "Remember what we talked about. Don't read it, just deliver it to Melna."

I nodded to him respectfully, but I knew what power my insatiable curiosity had over me, and I could not promise him that I wouldn't.

"Fellow observers. I've an errand to run and then I'll be on my way to Shaki. Thank you for entrusting me with this mission. I won't let you down."

"Good luck, Liffa," said Jathi, somberly.

"Don't get yourself killed," said Thimlu.

"Aey? Kipnu?" I called as I entered the clinic. Laen poked his head through the doorway as well. I kept my voice low, as it was the middle of the mid-day nap, and called again, "Kipnu?"

With a sleepy lilt he voiced a sort of greeting from a room at the far end of a hallway and I followed it there, leaving Laen at the door. When I came to the opening he was sprawled out on a cot, having fallen back asleep in mere moments. I watched him for a moment, feeling oddly affectionate toward a man I'd seen just a bit ago.

"Hey," I interrupted myself, "I'm sorry to wake you but I need to talk."

He shuffled around the cot, looking confused, then looked up at my shadow in the doorway.

"Liffa, that you?"

He pushed himself up and took a moment to wake, his sleepy eyes still partially covered by his eyehaw. I searched for a switch nearby and flipped it on, filling the room with a pale orange light.

"You surprised me," he said. "What brings you here?"

"I'm going on a short trip. I'll be gone for a bit."

"A trip? Where?" He asked, his eyes now completely open.

"To the capital. Melna needs me for something."

"You're going all the way to the capital to settle an argument? Why can't you wait until she comes back?"

"It's not an argument anymore."

"Then what is it?"

"It's a long story, and I don't have the time."

"I'm not looking for the story," he said exasperated. "I just want to know what you're going to the capital for."

I backed away and stammered, "I'll tell you later. I promised Laen I'd get him some cakes. Take care of him when you get home, will you?"

I turned to walk out the door, but he called for me again, and I couldn't help but stop. His eyes were pleading, worried.

"We swore the Oath of Trust to each other," he reminded me. "Whatever is going on between you two affects me as well."

I stood just outside, staring at the gaudy patterned wood floor of his office while the weight of what I was about to do finally came to me.

He pushed again, "If you won't tell me, then I'm going with you."

"You have patients to see," I said.

"They can wait."

"Kipnu-"

_I could run now. I wanted to run. I had this all planned out: deliver the message, then serve my time in Ulukoma and come back. I could survive. But if Kipnu came with me? I would have to fend for both of us in Ulukoma. Kipnu couldn't find food in the wild, or fight off someone trying to steal from us. He doesn't know how to survive in a place like that._

I lowered my voice and spoke resolutely. "It may take a while, but I'll be back. I promise."

"What are you talking about? The trains run all day."

I paused not knowing how to respond, and in that time his face turned to realization.

"No," he said. "You're interrupting the senate?"

His gaze cast doubt on my resolve. How easy it would have been to say yes; to have him next to me while I interrupted a room full of politicians to deliver a note. To know that I wouldn't be alone when I did what I felt was right. But my comfort wasn't worth Kipnu's safety. I had to keep him out of it.

"Why?" he asked.

I couldn't hold back the moisture pooling on my cheeks, the "mist of grief" as my mother called it. I took a deep breath to cool myself down and wiped it away, and felt even more resolute.

"It's necessary," I said.

I hopped onto Laen and didn't look back.
