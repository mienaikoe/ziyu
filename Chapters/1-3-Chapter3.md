## Chapter 3

The late morning light was just enough for me to see while I dashed to the stable to get Laen-Laen, our Saffa. He was small for a Saffa, but at twelve times my own weight, he still had more than enough strength to fit both Jathi and me.

"Laen-Laen, good morning!" I greeted him and he gave out a whoop as he woke up from his half-nap. "You're still asleep, Laen?"

A loud and wavering "Ooooo" filled the room as he walked to me and yawned in my face.

"Hey grass-breath, can you take me to Heiko central?"

He snorted his disapproval with his fuzzy ears turned backward.

"We can stop by Gilli's and get a cake."

"Ooop!" He chittered as he perked up and twisted his head left and right.

"There we go. Now lets get you ready."

I took a soft linen blanket from the wall and recalled the times when Jathi and I used to walk with Laen along the coastline in the fog of morning. We'd finish the night shifts we worked together at the observatory and then go play in the water or get lost in the gray abyss until the fog lifted to show us where we'd gone. Even though we'd stayed up all night, we were never tired when we were together.

But this was no time for memories. Jathi had a duty to fulfill, and I had a mystery to solve. I led Laen down the alley toward the front gate where Jathi was waiting for me.

"Didn't think we would be doing this again," he said, "The three of us on a morning adventure."

"Adventure?" I said surprised. "It's just a stop by the conduit. Hardly the meanderings in the fog we used to do."

"There's always something new with you, Liffa."

The winds were slowly picking up while we rode down the long, packed-clay road from my home toward the center of town. The perfect ring shape of the crown of Palinan was splitting the sky in two. The white light of Ara and its golden splendor was to our right and Ulu, the darkness, was to our left. Wispy clouds hung high in the sky, reaching across the crown of twilight to enter into that dark abyss.

I wondered what was happening to Ara. As a child, I learned that the observers had found that Palinan was orbiting Ara in a big ellipse, which gives us the bright and dim times. They also knew that there were other, much redder stars very far away. Exactly how far, they couldn't be certain, but they were much too far to reach in our lifetimes. Even with the fastest vehicles.

I wondered if the stars could die like we did, or if they had always been there, like holes in the firmament.

At the end of the path, we turned a corner and crossed the train line just after the station, onto a side street into town. It was rather peaceful, as the first meal time had just passed into rest time. We reached the conduit office and quickly hopped off of Laen. I gave him a thankful pat on the neck and he gave me back a small "oop" of acknowledgement.

When I entered, an old man who seemed to know Jathi was already inside, standing by the doorway.

"Aey, lad," he said, "You forgot to clean the lenses. And weren't you supposed to be looking for Melna?"

"Yes, Thimlu. There's been a bit of a snag. Melna's already left."

"Well that's not good. 's not good at all."

"Have you reached any of the other observatories?"

"The only other two are in Holrag. And they're both unresponsive. Kantha really should be picking up. He knows about this."

"No worries," Jathi said with a chipper voice. "I'll try Melna's personal line."

Jathi set himself at the phone desk and attempted to reach the court. There was no space for two people at the desk, so I stayed standing closer to the door. The ceiling was a towering, ordered nest of small rails to different homes within Heiko. There was a big rail, which I assume went to Shaki.

"Shaki Conduit, This is Heiko Conduit."

Another caller delivered a message, but none from Shaki. He waited a tick and then repeated.

"Shaki Conduit, This is -"

"Heiko, this is Shaki. Please remember to speak in your turn."

"Shaki, we are requesting priority. This is an urgent call to the Senate."

There was silence for a moment as all of the operators paused to listen in.

"Heiko, which conduit in the senate are you requesting connection to?"

"The Heiko fidelant's private conduit, please."

The conduit operator paused.

"Heiko, I assume you have a damn good reason for that."

"Yes, I do. It's a message pertaining to today's assembly."

He paused and sighed.

"Transferring you to Heiko Senate. Please wait a moment."

I took the moment of silence to shift to a chair and sit down close to Jathi. He opened the message and flattened it on the table, memorizing the pronunciation of the more technical words. I glanced at it but couldn't read the writing from my distance. There was a scribbled drawing of a circle and some dots on it, but I couldn't make out what they were.

Thimlu interrupted me, "I remember you from orbital. Couldn't teach Jathi a damn thing until you left. Why couldn't you two find a nice woman and settle down?"

Jathi's cheeks went red, and he protested, "Thimlu! You can't say something lke that."

"Bah. Observers are sworn to observe, and this one's pretty clear."

The line opened and an unenthused maman spoke, "Conduit of the Heiko Senate, Assistant Pomri."

"Pomri, I have an urgent message for Melna."

"Jathi? By Ara, don't you ever sleep? It's the middle of first nap."

"What we've found at the observatory was too important."

She sighed, "Well, I'm afraid you're too late. Melna is in assembly."

"When will she be out?"

"Who's to say? It could take the whole day."

"This message is of utmost importance. It will affect today's deliberations. Is there any way you can tell her?"

"It's unlawful to interrupt the assembly."

"Surely you can make an exception."

"And I would surely be imprisoned for it."

He sighed in frustration burying his eyes in his hand.

"Pomri," he replied with pessimism. "You can't be serious. Even if there is a law against interrupting the assembly, a magistrate would look the other way at sentencing."

"You ever been to Shaki?"

He hesitated, "Well, no but –"

"– Something to learn before you come. Magistrates get off on being right even if they're wrong. Just wait until the assembly is done."

"But... we can't wait the entire day."

"Look, it sounds like this is really important. Why don't you come to Shaki and we can talk it over?"

"You're asking me to come to the senate? What, so... so I can be the one to do it instead of you?"

"I'm sorry I can't do more, kid. Laws here are really backward but at least we can grumble about 'em. Just think about it."

He sighed, "Yea. I'll consider it," he said.

"Thanks," she said, and the line went silent.

I built some resolve and double checked that the microphone was off.

"I'll go," I said.

"What are you talking about?"

"I'll interrupt the Senate"

"That's crazy. You heard Pomri. You'll be sent to Ulukoma."

Thimlu butted in. "This is of utmost importance," he said with a smirk on his face. "A magistrate would surely look the other way at sentencing."

Jathi shouted back at him, "Whose side are you on here?!"

I was astonished. Jathi was always so calm and now he was the most animated I had ever seen him. He sighed and sat back, turning it over in his head. I rose from the desk and paced the floor across from him, pausing to admire the old wood floor that countless messengers before him had walked upon.

I tried to convince him again, "I can't think of any better way to do it."

"You are sacrificing too much. The bureaucracy behind the court is impossible."

"It's a sacrifice I'm willing for Liffa to take," said Thimlu. He took the words right out of my mouth.

I explained my thoughts. "One of us has to do it. If this is as important as you say, then there will be a lot of chatter for the next few days. One of you has to keep the communication lines open amidst all that chaos, and one of you has to keep watching the sky for more data. Besides, I have some strings I can pull at the senate. I stand a much better chance."

Jathi seemed defeated but he looked up into my eyes and locked with my gaze.

"If this works, we'll all petition the magistrate for a lighter sentence."

"Don't worry about me," I told him. "Wherever they send me to, I can handle it."

I gathered my bag onto my shoulders, and stood near the doorway as they looked on.

"Gentlemen. I've an errand to run and then I'll be on my way to Shaki. Thank you for entrusting me with this mission. I won't let you down."

"Good luck, Liffa," said Jathi, somberly.

"Don't get yourself killed," said Thimlu.

"Aey? Kipnu?" I called as I entered the clinic. He chirped sleepily from a back room and I followed the call. I came to the doorway and watched him for a moment. His sleepy face always made me swoon no matter how silly it looked.

"Hey," I interrupted myself, "I'm sorry to wake you but I need to talk."

He shuffled around the cot, looking confused, then looked up at my shadow in the doorway.

"Liffa, that you?"

He pushed himself up and took a moment to wake up. Then he pulled a lightglass from his pocket and slid it onto the power rails above him. His sleepy eyes were still partially covered by his eyehaw.

"You surprised me. What brings you here?"

"I'm going on a trip to the capital."

"What? Why?" He asked, his eyes now completely open.

"It's just something between Melna and me"

"You're going all the way to the capital to settle an argument? Why can't you wait until she comes back?"

"It's... a long story"

"You mean you don't want to tell me"

I paused, dumbstruck and scrambling for words.

"You're keeping a secret. Tell me what's going on-"

I backed away and stammered, "I'll tell you later. Take care of Laen-Laen, he'll be coming back home."

I turned to walk out the door, but he grabbed my wrist to stop me. His eyes were pleading, worried.

"We swore the Oath of Trust to each other," he reminded me. "Whatever is going on between you affects me as well."

"You can't be involved."

"I already am."

I fought off his grip, and stood just outside the door, staring at the gaudy iron floor of his office.

He pushed again, "If you won't tell me, then I'm going with you to find out myself."

"You couldn't - you have patients to see"

"They can wait."

"Kipnu-"

_I could run now. I wanted to run. I had this all planned out. I would deliver the message, then serve my time in Ulukoma and come back redeemed. Kipnu and Melna would understand. I would survive. But Kipnu? I would have to fend for both of us in a place like that. He doesn't know how to survive on the gifts of Palinan alone._

I lowered my voice and spoke resolutely. "If you go with me, it will be a long time before you come back."

"What are you talking about? The trains run four times a day."

"This isn't about the trains. I'm going on this journey alone and it might be a while before I'm back."

"Stop being cryptic. What are you planning, Liffa?"

His gaze cast doubt on my resolve. How easy it would have been to say yes; to have him next to me while I interrupted a room full of intellectuals about some important science I didn't understand. To know that I wasn't alone in thinking this was the right thing.

But his pain would have become me if I'd let him do this. The path forward was clear: he couldn't be involved.

"Goodbye," I said.

I hopped onto Laen and didn't look back.
