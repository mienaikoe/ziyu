## Chapter 3

"Ara? Why would Melna need to know about that?"

"The observers on Falni Peak are doing some study about the stellar surface and they said they've found something big and need to tell the senate right away"

_She's keeping a secret_

"Well, if she's not here, I should go back to call the capital."

"Wait. Let me go with you."

"Oh that's really not necessary -"

"I need to know more; I won't slow you down" I plead to him while I ran off to fetch a new pair of trousers as quickly as I could.

The late morning light was just enough for me to see while I dashed to the stable to get Laen-Laen, our Saffa. He was small for a Saffa, but at twelve times my own weight, he was more than enough to fit Jesse and me.

"Laen-Laen, good morning!"

He gave out a whoop as he woke up from his half-nap.

"You're still asleep, Laen?"

A loud "Ooo" sound filled the room as he stood up and yawned in my face.

"Hey grass-breath, can you take me to Heiko central?"

He snorted his disapproval with his fuzzy ears turned backward.

"We can stop by Gilli's and get a cake."

"Woop woop woop!" He said as he perked up and twisted his head left and right.

"There we go. Now lets get you ready."

I took a soft linen blanket from the wall and paused a moment to remember when Jesse and I used to walk with a younger Laen along the foggy coastline in the mornings. The three of us would play hide and seek on a wide open beach and just get lost shouting to each other in the gray abyss until the fog lifted.

_Not the time for memories_. I snapped out and hopped on while rushing to the front gate where Jesse was waiting for me.

"Didn't think we would be doing this again, " he said.

"Never thought we would be delivering a message to the senate."

"There's always something new with you, Liffa."

The winds were slowly picking up while we rode down the long, sintered-clay path from my home toward the center of town. The perfect ring shape of the crown of Palinan was splitting the sky in two. The white light of Ara and its golden splendor was to our right and Ulu, the darkness, was to our left. Whispy clouds hung high in the sky, reaching across the crown of twilight to enter into that dark abyss. 

I wondered what was happening to Ara. As a child, I learned that the observers had found that Palinan was orbiting Ara in a big ellipse, which gives us the bright and dim times. They also knew that there were other, much redder stars very far away. Exactly how far, they couldn't be certain, but they were much too far to reach in our lifetimes. Even with the fastest vehicles.

I wondered if the stars could die like we did, or if they had always been there, like holes in the firmament.

At the end of the path, we turned a corner and crossed the train line just after the station, onto a side street into town. It was rather peaceful, as the first meal time had just passed into rest time. We reached the conduit office and quickly hopped off of Laen. I gave him a thankful pat on the neck and he gave me back a small woop of acknowledgement.

When I entered, an old man who seemed to know Jesse was already inside, standing by the doorway. 

"Aey, lad," he said, "You forgot to clean the lenses. And weren't you supposed to be looking for Melna?"

"Yes, Thimlu. There's been a bit of a snag. Melna's already left."

"Well that's not good. 's not good at all."

"Have you reached any of the other observatories?"

"The only other two are in Holrag. And they're both unresponsive. Kantha really should be picking up. He knows about this."

"No worries," Jesse said with a chipper voice. "I'll try Melna's personal line."

Jesse set himself at the phone desk and attempted to reach the court. There was no space for two people at the desk, so I stayed standing closer to the door. The ceiling was a towering, ordered nest of small rails to different homes within Heiko. There was a big rail, which I assume went to Shaki.

"Shaki Conduit, This is Heiko Conduit."

Another caller delivered a message, but none from Shaki. He waited a tick and then repeated.

"Shaki Conduit, This is -"

"Heiko, this is Shaki. Please remember to speak in your turn."

"Shaki, we are requesting priority. This is an urgent call to the Senate."

There was silence for a moment as all of the operators paused to listen in.

"Heiko, which conduit in the senate are you requesting connection to?"

"The Heiko fidelant's private conduit, please."

The conduit operator paused.

"Heiko, I assume you have a damn good reason for that."

"Yes, I do. It's a message pertaining to today's assembly."

He paused and sighed.

"Transferring you to Heiko Senate. Please wait a moment."

I took the moment of silence to shift to a chair and sit down close to Jesse. He opened the message and flattened it on the table, memorizing the pronunciation of the more technical words. I glanced at it but couldn't read the writing from my distance. There was a scribbled drawing of a circle and some dots on it, but I couldn't make out what they were.

Thimlu interrupted us, "I remember you two lovebirds from orbital. Couldn't teach you a damn thing until thi left. Why didn't you just marry him instead, Liffa?"

Jesse's cheeks went red, and he protested, "Thimlu! You can't say something lke that."

"Bah. Observers are sworn to observe, and this one's pretty clear."

The line opened and an unenthused maman spoke, "Conduit of the Heiko Senate, Assistant Pomri."

"Pomri, I have an urgent message for Melna."

"Jesse? By Ara, don't you ever sleep? It's the middle of first nap."

"What we've found at the observatory was too important to nap on."

She sighed, "Well, I'm afraid you're too late. Melna is currently in assembly."

"When will she be out?"

"It can last anywhere from 2 tova'na to the whole day."

"This message is of utmost importance. It will likely affect today's deliberations. Is there any way you can tell her?"

"It's unlawful to interrupt the assembly."

"Surely you can make an exception."

"And I would surely be imprisoned for it."

He sighed in frustration burying his eyes in his hand.

"Pomri," he replied with pessimism. "You can't be serious. Even if there is a law against interrupting the assembly, a magistrate would look the other way at sentencing."

"You ever been to Shaki?"

He hesitated, "Well, no but –"

"– Something to learn before you come. Magistrates get off on being right even if they're wrong. Just wait until the assembly is done."

"But... we can't wait the entire day."

"Look, it sounds like this is really important. Why don't you come to Shaki and we can talk it over?"

"You're asking us to come to the senate? So one of us can do it instead of you?"

"I'm sorry I can't do more, kid. Laws here are really backward but at least I can grumble about 'em. Just think about what I said."

He sighed, "Yea. We- I'll consider it," he said.

"Thanks," she said, and the line went silent.

I built some resolve and double checked that the microphone was off.

"I'll go," I said.

"What are you talking about?"

"I'll interrupt the Senate"

"That's crazy. You heard Pomri. You'll be sent to Ulukoma."

Thimlu butted in. "This is of utmost importance," he said with a smirk on his face. "A magistrate would surely look the other way at sentencing."

Jesse shouted back at him, "Whose side are you on here?!"

I was astonished. Jesse was always so calm and now he was the most animated I had ever seen him. He sighed and sat back, turning it over in his head. I rose from the desk and paced the floor across from him, pausing to admire the old wood floor that countless messengers before him had walked upon.

I tried to convince him again, "I can't think of any better way to do it."

"You are sacrificing too much. The bureaucracy behind the court is impossible."

"It's a sacrifice I'm willing for Liffa to take," said Thimlu. He took the words right out of my mouth.

I explained my thoughts. "One of us has to do it. If this is as important as you say, then there will be a lot of chatter for the next few days. One of you has to keep the communication lines open amidst all that chaos, and one of you has to keep watching the sky for more data. Besides, I have some strings I can pull at the senate. I stand a much better chance."

Jesse seemed defeated but he looked up into my eyes and we locked gazes for a while.

"If you pull this off, I'll petition the magistrate for a lighter sentence."

"Don't worry about me," I told him. "I've got a coat."

I gathered my bag onto my shoulders, and stood near the doorway as they looked on.

"Gentlemen. I've an errand to run and then I'll be on my way to Shaki. Thank you for entrusting me with this mission. I won't let you down."

"Good luck, Liffa," said Jesse, somberly.

"Don't get murdered," said Thimlu.

"Aey? Kipnu?" I called as I entered his office. He chirped sleepily from a back room and I followed the call.

"Hey I'm sorry to wake you but I need to talk."

He shuffled around, looking confused, then pulled a light from his pocket and slid it onto the power rails above him. His sleepy eyes were still partially covered by his eyehaw.

"Liffa? Oh, you surprised me. What brings you here?"

"I'm going on a trip to the capital."

"What? Why?" He asked, his eyes now completely open.

"It's just something between Melna and me"

"You're going all the way to the capital to settle an argument? Why can't you wait until she comes back?"

"It's... a long story"

"You mean you don't want to tell me"

I paused, dumbstruck and scrambling for words.

"You're keeping a secret. Tell me what's going on-"

I backed away and stammered, "I'll tell you later. Take care of Laen-Laen, he'll be coming back home."

I turned to walk out the door, but he grabbed my wrist to stop me. His eyes were pleading, worried.

"We swore the Oath of Trust to each other," he reminded me. "Whatever is going on between you affects me as well."

"You can't be involved."

"I already am."

I fought off his grip, and stood just outside the door, staring at the gaudy iron floor of his office and vying with my own thoughts.

_I could run now. I wanted to run. I had this all planned out. I would deliver the message, then survive Ulukoma and come back redeemed. Kipnu and Melna would understand. In the worst case, I would get a little cold in the dark. But Kipnu? I would have to fend for him too. He doesn't know how to survive on the land_

He pushed again, "If you won't tell me, then I'm going with you to find out myself."

"You couldn't - you have patients to see"

"They can wait."

"Kipnu-"

"Why can't you let me in?"

"Kipnu...if you go with me, it will be a long time before you come back."

"What are you talking about? The trains run four times a day."

"This isn't about the trains, ok? I'm going on this journey alone and it might be a while before I come back."

"Stop being cryptic. What are you planning, Liffa?"

His gaze cast doubt on my resolve. How easy it would have been to say yes; to have him next to me while I interrupted a room full of intellectuals about some important science I didn't understand. To know that I wasn't alone in thinking this was the right thing. 

No. His guilt would be my guilt. He can't be involved in this.

_It's clear._

"Goodbye," I said.

I hopped onto Laen and didn't look back.
