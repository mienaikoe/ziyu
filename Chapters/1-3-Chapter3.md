## Chapter 3

<!--

  In this chapter, I'm exploring the first instance of action writing.

  The messenger, Žesse is delivering a note from a local observatory
  that has found evidence of a peculiar sunspot that doesn't move and is growing.

  He doesn't know what's in the message. Only that there has been an ongoing correspondence between Mel and observer Shib, and that this message was urgent.

  They proceed back to the messenger office to send the message via tele-line and her assistant takes the call and promises to deliver the urgent message. The message itself is cryptic and neither Žesse nor Lif can understand it.

  Lif decides to go to the city (about 100km - 5 clicks away) to find out more. Once she gets there, she is stopped and told to wait as the meeting is already underway. Lif uses her agility and stealth to snoop on the meeting after Mel has delivered her news. The meeting is still tough to understand as there is heated argument and debate about what to do. The chapter ends on a pivotal reveal of the plot driver

  "Ara? Why would Mel need to know about that?"

  "The observers on Falni Peak are doing some study about the stellar surface and they said they've found something big and need to tell the senate right away"

  *She's keeping a secret*

  "Well, if she's not here, I should go back to call the capital."

  "Wait. Let me go with you."

  "Oh that's really not necessary -"

  "I need to know more; I won't slow you down" I pleaded to him while I ran off to fetch a new pair of trousers as quickly as I could.

  The late morning light was just enough for me to see while I dashed to the stable to get Laen-Laen, our Saffa. He was small for a Saffa, but at twelve times my own weight, he was more than enough to fit Žesse and me.

  "Laen-Laen, good morning!"

  He gave out a whoop as he woke up from his half-nap.

  "Laen-Laen, you're still asleep?"

  A loud "Ooo" sound filled the room as he stood up and yawned in my face.

  "Hey grass-breath, can you take me to Heiko central?"

  He snorted his disapproval with his fuzzy ears turned backward.

  "We can stop by Gilli's and get a cake."

  "Whoop whoop whoop!" He said as he perked up and twisted his head left and right.

  "There we go. Now lets get you ready."

  I took a soft linen blanket from the wall and paused a moment to remember when Žesse and I used to ride a younger Laen-Laen along the foggy coastline in the mornings. The three of us would play hide and seek on a wide open beach and just get lost shouting to each other in the gray abyss until the fog lifted.

  *Not the time for memories*. I snapped out and hopped on while rushing to the front gate where Žesse was waiting for me.

  "Didn't think we would be doing this again, " he said.

  "Well, I never thought we would be delivering a message to the senate."

  "Sometimes you're just a barrel of surprises, Lif."

  The winds were slowly picking up while we rode down the long, sintered-clay path from my home toward the center of town. The perfect ring shape of the crown of Palinan was splitting the sky in two. The white light of Ara and its golden splendor was to our right and Ulu, the darkness, was to our left. Several clouds hung high the sky, reaching across the crown to enter into that dark abyss. I wondered what was happening to Ara. As a child, I learned that the observers had found that Palinan was orbiting Ara in a big ellipse, which gives us the day and night times. They also knew that there were other stars like Ara very far away, but much too far to reach in our lifetimes. I wondered if the stars could die like we did.

  At the end of the path, we turned a corner and crossed the train line just after the station, onto a side street into town. It was rather peaceful, as the first meal time had just passed into rest time. We reached the conduit office and quickly hopped off of Laen-Laen. I gave him a thankful pat on the neck and he gave me back a small whoop of acknowledgement.

  When I entered, Žesse was already squatting at the phone desk attempting to reach the court. There was no space for two people at the desk, so I stayed standing closer to the door. The ceiling was a towering, ordered nest of small rails to different homes within Heiko. There was a big rail, which I assume went to Shaki.

  "Shaki Conduit, This is Heiko Conduit."

  Another caller delivered a message, but none from Shaki. He waited a tick and then repeated.

  "Shaki Conduit, This is -"

  "Heiko, this is Shaki. Please remember to speak in your turn."

  "Shaki, we are requesting priority. This is an urgent call to the Court."

  There was silence for a moment as all of the operators paused to listen in.

  "Heiko, which conduit in the court are you requesting connection to?"

  "The Heiko Senator's private conduit, please."

  The conduit operator paused.

  "Heiko, I assume you have a damn good reason for that."

  "Yes, I do."

  He paused and sighed.

  "Transferring you to Heiko Senator. Please wait a moment."

  I took the moment of silence to shift to a chair and sit down close to Žesse. He opened the message and flattened it on the table, memorizing the pronunciation of the more technical words. I glanced at it but couldn't read the writing from my distance. There was a scribbled drawing of a circle and some dots on it, but I couldn't make out what they were.

  The line opened and an unenthused maman spoke, "Heiko Senator's conduit, Clerk Pomri."

  "Clerk Pomri, I have an urgent message for Melna."

  "Senator Melna is currently in assembly."

  "When will she be out?"

  "It can last anywhere from 2 va'na to the whole day."

  "This will likely affect today's deliberations. Is there any way you can get this to her?"

  "It's unlawful to interrupt the assembly"

  "Surely you can make an exception"

  "And I would surely be imprisoned for it."

  He sighed in frustration burying his eyes in his hand.

  He replied, "This is outrageous. You can't interrupt the assembly for something that pertains to it? What kind of law is that?"

  "It's a law. If that's all, I have some other things to attend to."

  He sighed, "Yea. I guess that's it," and turned off the microphone.

  I built some resolve and double checked that the line was off.

  "I'll go," I said.

  "What are you talking about?"

  "I'll interrupt the Senate"

  "That's crazy, you'll be sent to Ulukoma."

  "If this is as important as you say, then it would be worth a few days in the cold."

  He shouted, "More than just a few!"

  I was astonished. He was always so laid back and now he was the most animated I had ever seen him. He sighed and sat back, turning it over in his head. I approached the desk and squatted across from him, pausing to admire the old wood that countless messengers before him had worked from.

  I tried to convince him again, "I can't think of any better way to do it"

  "You are sacrificing too much. The bureaucracy behind the court is impossible."

  "If this is as important as you say, then there will be a lot of chatter for the next few days. Someone has to keep the communication lines open amidst all that chaos."

  He seemed defeated but looked up into my eyes and we locked gazes for a while.

  "If you pull this off, we will all petition for your return."

  "Don't worry. I've got a coat."

  "Hello? Kip?" I called as I entered his office. He chirped sleepily from a back room and I followed the call.

  "Hey I'm sorry to wake you but I need to talk."

  He shuffled around, looking confused, then pulled a light from his pocket and slid it onto the rails. His sleepy eyes were still partially covered by his eyehaw.

  "Lif? Oh, you surprised me. What brings you here?"

  "I'm going on a trip to the capital."

  "What? Why?" He asked, his eyes now completely open.

  "It's just something between Mel and me"

  "You're going all the way to the capital to settle an argument? Why can't you wait until she comes back?"

  "It's... a long story"

  "You mean you don't want to tell me"

  I paused, dumbstruck and scrambling for words.

  "You're keeping a secret. Tell me what's going on-"

  I backed away and stammered, "I'll tell you later. Take care of Laen-Laen, he'll be at the station."

  I turned to walk out the door, and he grabbed my wrist. I winced and looked back at his eyes. They were pleading, worried.
  "We swore the Oath of Trust to each other," he reminded me. "Whatever is going on between you affects me as well."

  "You can't be involved."

  "I already am."

  He released his grip, and I stood just outside the door, still vying with my own thoughts.

  *I could run now. I wanted to run. I had this all planned out. I would deliver the message, then survive Ulukoma and come back redeemed. Kip and Mel would understand. In the worst case, I would get a little cold in the dark. But Kip? I would have to fend for him too. He doesn't know how to survive on the land*

  He pushed again, "If you won't tell me, then I'm going with you to find out myself."

  "You couldn't - you have patients to see"

  "They can wait a va'ala until I return"

  "Kip-"

  "You really don't want me to go, do you?"

  "Kip...if you go with me, it will be a long time before you come back."

  "What are you talking about? The trains run four times a day."

  "This isn't about the trains, ok? I'm going on this journey alone and it might be a while before I come back"

  "Stop being cryptic. What are you planning, Lif?"

  His gaze cast an unseen heat on my resolve. How easy it would be to have him next to me while I interrupted the court of Shaki about some important science I didn't understand. To know that I wasn't alone in thinking this was the right thing. But any punishment or irreversible injury that might befall him would be my guilt to carry. It's not the sort of thing that fades away.

  *It's clear*

  "Goodbye," I said.

  I hopped onto Laen-Laen and didn't look back.
