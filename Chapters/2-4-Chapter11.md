  Cas teaches Kip about radio,
    ( It annoys me that Lin is just a background character so far. )
  Kip hears messages from Holragi
  Casra secretly plans with Setre to be taken to Lissa as a martyrdom
  A sound is broadcast to people with coils, and they start a mutiny against Lissa. Lissa and Casra are killed in the action.
    Set mourns over hae. Lin is vengeful at Set. Kip mourns from a distance, feeling a bit guilty for being an intruder.
    Casra says hae last words to them and talks about a better future - Kip is reminded that hae death will be for nothing unless he does something to stop the ice age.

  Interlogue:
    Next day, a boat comes for everyone who is able-bodied and able-minded to help Shaki power-build a space rail at Yansha. Kip gets on the boat and regrets what happened at the shadestead, but feels hopeful for the future with Setre in charge.


  Thoughts:
  - The reader will be unsatisfied about Casra being killed off.
    - But it's a satisfying death.
  - Is radio that useful?
    - It will be to listen to Lif who will give instructions for sending a sign of good will
      - A weapon like Holragi would plan to send would be a sign of bad will, and more robots would come later (BOOK 2)
      - Their alternative is for people from all 3 corners of the rim to collaboratively work on a problem and send an ambassador to deliver it.
        - Mel volunteers
        - They can collaborate with telegraph. Why is wireless important?
          - Wireless will teach them about far infrared/CO2/Greenhouse effect ???
          - Wireless is how they will keep in contact with the machines instead of destroying them like Holragi
            - Machines to Mel: "There is more you must learn." Mel gets angry and tries to convince them. "Give me back my Lif."
    - Mel will want to know Holragi's plans.

## Ch11


  "Lin, fetch your radio and a listener," Casra requested.

  The air had picked up and become colder than before. Kip considered telling Casra about the obstruction of Ara, and the oncoming ice age. He had been keeping it a secret from these people for so long, but he could never find a good time to bring it up - it would only get in the way. *Mel...Which big-headed jerks are you entertaining today?*

  Linyu emerged with a wooden box no longer than hae forearm, and a small wooden disc with a hole in the middle. They looked plain and rather ordinary - not the huge metal monstrosities he had imagined them to be. Thi handed the box and disc to Kip and then went to hae mother to help hae with the large coil. Near the tree they cleared away some shrubs and opened another door in the ground, far too shallow to live in. From the trench, they produced another wooden box with a very smlll footprint.
