## Chapter 11

A rustling sound roused Kipnu from a deep sleep.

"Someone's here," Casra whispered, reaching behind their bed and pulling out two steel-tipped wooden poles. Thi handed one to Kipnu, who nearly dropped it on the ground in surprise. "I'll go first," thi said, approaching the ladder.

Kipnu shook off his disorientation and grasped the wooden pole to hoist himself to his feet, feeling dizzy from the sudden panic. He followed as Casra went up the ladder and cracked the door to peer through. From the corner of his eye, Linyu stayed near the bed, watching intently at hae mother's movements from the pliant shelter of a blanket.

"Watch Linyu," Casra commanded and with a swift press against the ladder thi had already set a foot on the ground and began making hae way toward the sound. Linyu and Kipnu crept calmly up the ladder and behind a tree to watch and listen.

"The wind speaks!", called the stranger with a frantic and hushed voice, and Casra came out to meet hae in the forest. "Did you find him?" the figure called. The voice was that of a maman; familiar but there were no faces he could remember to match the voice.

"Quiet, the forest listens," said Casra. "Come inside."

But the maman stopped hae, "We don't have time. Guardians followed me into the forest. I lost them about halfway here, but they could be here any moment."

"Is Setre with them?" Casra asked.

"I don't know," thi responded. "But we have to go now."

Casra took but a moment to think of a plan. "All of you up the tree. I will follow close behind."

Kipnu looked around. "Which tree?" he asked, but Linyu quickly took his hand and led him to a steep incline in the ground. The stranger was already ahead of them, moving in flashes of a faint blue light: old flow tattoos scrawled across hae back flitting back and forth like a sword in the dark.

"Follow hae," Linyu whispered.

The maman moved far faster than him, using the small niches in the bark to move quickly up the narrow trunk of the inclined tree. Kipnu contemplated looking down, but knew better than to sabotage his own mind. The maman stopped at a bifurcation in the branches and donned a kelp coat that thi was carrying, obscuring the blue light on hae skin and giving Kipnu a chance to catch up. From the remnants of light under hae coat, he saw the face of a maman he'd saved from the water mere nights ago. "Ginnu!" he gasped.

Thi made a curt airy sound with hae breath and placed a finger on his lips, signaling for quiet. Below them, a pair of feet were meandering quietly across the leaves with the faint sound of others moving quickly through the forest.

Kipnu looked back and whispered to Linyu, "where is your mother?"

"Thi..." Linyu looked back in confusion. "Thi was right behind me."

The sound of the closer pair of footsteps came to a stop as the others were still far off. "Setre!" Casra's voice boomed through the trees. "I'm sure you're as happy to see me as I am to see you."

"You always did know how to make a woman feel welcome," Setre replied. Her voice was impatient but had a tinge of softness to it, almost imperceptable but to those who knew her well. "How is Linyu?" she asked.

"Thi has grown," replied Casra. "Thi is much smarter, wiser than I was at that age."

Setre's voice grew quiet. "Can I see h–?"

"–With hunters at your heel?" Casra quickly stopped her with a cold tone. "No. Of course not." Hae tone shifted back to warmth as if surprised at what it had become. "But trust me, Lin can see you right now. Thi misses you."

Linyu drew a sharp breath, hae face flush with emotion, but thi wouldn't dare make a sound to alert Setre. Kipnu placed a hand on hae back in consolation and to make sure thi didn't alert her to their presence.

The footsteps from the forest grew into faint blue lights and Setre made haste. "Where is Kipnu?"

"He is safe. Why does it matter?" asked Casra.

She rose her voice in escalation. "Things have changed and I need him back."

"You know I need him to pull more people. Shinna can keep the next hot guy that comes hae way."

Setre rebuked hae. "This isn't about Shinna. Something's happened. I need help."

A man's voice called from afar, "Setre!"

Setre glanced back for only a moment to find that Casra had disappeared back into the dark forest.

"You find Ginnu?" the man asked as he caught up to her. He was joined quickly by two others.

"No. Just the remnants of an old fire," she replied. "Thi can't be far; let's split up and keep searching."

They nodded their assent and set off in different directions as Setre stayed behind, her eyes turned toward the forest as if to search for something she'd lost. Her eyes caught the coil embedded to the side of the tree, and her breath caressed the metal as she spoke into it.

"Linyu," she paused on hae name as if to let her thoughts ferment into words. Kipnu and Linyu clutched their listeners to their ears as she continued. "Something's happened. You might not see me for a while. Get your mother to the mainland, ok? It's not safe here anymore."

Linyu sighed as if to release an overflow of emotion.

"I love you," Setre muttered under her breath.

"I love you," whispered Linyu to the cool air.

Setre took a few steps back and turned to look toward where she'd come from. A large figure walked forward, his skin swallowing the light from hers. Setre looked down as he approached and she walked around him, but he stopped her with just a word.

"Love," he said with a dismissive puff through his nose. He sowed condescension into the air as if to mock the very thought of being close to someone.

Kipnu could sense that Ginnu had an aversion to this man. Each of hae breaths chased the next one as if his voice had stolen the air from hae lungs for a single word. Kipnu glanced at hae face, saw deeply troubled eyes and a jaw intensely clenched. Never had he seen someone so bothered by the mere presence of another.

Setre replied to him, "You'd understand if you ever met hae."

The shadowed man laughed. "I wonder what Shinna would think," he said. "You, of all people, clinging to the past. Love left you here long ago, my dear hunter, and it's not coming back."

"You are asleep," she replied. "if you think yourself greater than love." And in a moment she was back in the darkness of the forest, her blue skin weaving a tangled web in the trees. The man looked up into the trees and for a moment Kipnu could have sworn that his eyes were locked upon them, but the man turned from his gaze and walked off into the darkness, following Setre's footsteps.

A soft disturbance shook the branches around them as Casra's face emerged amidst the purple light.

"Kipnu," thi called to him. "There's something you're not telling us."

He stared at hae eyes nervously, thinking of how to tell them. "If I told you the world was ending, would you still want to save this place?" he asked, and Casra's eyes went wide with understanding.

"The world is ending?" Ginnu interjected. "How long do we have?"

"I can't be sure," said Kipnu, "but certainly it will be far too soon."

He glanced at Casra, who was ruminating upon hae own thoughts, then to Linyu who he felt especially sad to tell this to. But whether out of shock or disbelief, Linyu wore no sign of distress or sadness. Instead, thi chimed in with an observation, "There will be more people on today's ship."

Kipnu was surprised, and curious. "How... do you know?" he asked.

"People come here voluntarily when they feel like their world is about to end. I've even seen people come here because they lost money playing games. I never understood those ones."

Casra said, "Kipnu, yesterday you made it clear that you want to leave. I want to respect that, but I could really use your help before you go. Please help me bring all of them here so I can train them to turn this island back."

Kipnu was confused. "Why do you need me for that?" he asked.

"Even in this age, a maman needs a salve for kanosin and immense political influence to command people," Casra said. "You are not a maman, and you of all of us know best how to empathize with their struggles. They will follow you to me."

Kipnu paused, knowing thi was right, but wishing thi wasn't. "And afterward?" he asked, "They will all be coming here to look for a salvation that doesn't exist."

A pause filled the air, and Ginnu glanced quickly toward Casra, but with a quick glance downward Casra telegraphed something back to hae. The interaction was plain to those who understood the many gestures that mamen use to talk amongst each other silently, but to Kipnu, accustomed to speaking with his voice, such exchanges were impercetible. Casra smiled at him and said simply, "There is salvation in helping others have a second chance at life. Just leave the rest to me."

A slight rustling of leaves and swaying of branches marked the start of morning. Behind them, a mix of red stars were twinkling near the horizon. He pondered at all of the mysteries of this place, of Casra's bravery and Linyu's intelligence. And for the first time, Kipnu thought of himself as part of this island. His fate and the fate of the island were irreversibly linked. Maybe he would die here under this strange purple sky, but perhaps following Casra was the surest way to get back to the mainland and find Liffa again.

After a pause, thi spoke again. "The answer is yes, by the way." Kipnu looked puzzled but thi clarified. "Your question of whether I would stay here if the world was going to end. If it means my people, my kaln, have even one day of freedom before the end, all of this struggle will have been worth it."

He accepted the answer with a firm nod. "I feel the same about Liffa and Melna," he said.

"How will it happen?" asked Casra. "The end."

"Darkness," he replied. "And cold."

"I see..." said Casra solemnly. "We had better hurry then."
