## Chapter 11

A rustling sound roused Kipnu from a deep sleep.

"Someone's here," Casra whispered, reaching behind their bed and pulling out two steel-tipped wooden poles. Thi handed one to Kipnu, who nearly dropped it on the ground in surprise. "I'll go first," thi said, approaching the ladder.

Kipnu shook off his disorientation and grasped the wooden pole to hoist himself to his feet, feeling dizzy from the sudden panic. He followed as Casra went up the ladder and cracked the door to peer through. From the corner of his eye, Linyu stayed near the bed, watching intently at hae mother's movements from the pliant shelter of a blanket.

"Watch Linyu," Casra commanded and with a swift press against the ladder thi had already set a foot on the ground and began making hae way toward the sound. Linyu and Kipnu crept calmly up the ladder and behind a tree to watch and listen.

"The wind speaks!", called the stranger with a frantic and hushed voice, and Casra came out to meet hae in the forest. "Did you find him?" the figure called. The voice was that of a maman; familiar but there were no faces he could remember to match the voice.

"Quiet, the forest listens," said Casra. "Come inside."

But the maman stopped hae, "We don't have time. Guardians followed me into the forest. I lost them about halfway here, but they could be here any moment."

"Is Setre with them?" Casra asked.

"I don't know," thi responded. "But we have to go now."

Casra took but a moment to think of a plan. "All of you up the tree. I will follow close behind."

Kipnu looked around. "Which tree?" he asked, but Linyu quickly took his hand and led him to a steep incline in the ground. The stranger was already ahead of them, moving in flashes of a faint blue light: old flow tattoos scrawled across hae back flitting back and forth like a sword in the dark.

"Follow hae," Linyu whispered.

The maman moved far faster than him, using the small niches in the bark to move quickly up the narrow trunk of the inclined tree. Kipnu contemplated looking down, but knew better than to sabotage his own mind. The maman stopped at a bifurcation in the branches and donned a kelp coat that thi was carrying, obscuring the blue light on hae skin and giving Kipnu a chance to catch up. From the remnants of light under hae coat, he saw the face of a maman he'd saved from the water mere nights ago. "Ginnu!" he gasped.

Thi made a curt airy sound with hae breath and placed a finger on his lips, signaling for quiet. Below them, a pair of feet were meandering quietly across the leaves with the faint sound of others moving quickly through the forest.

Kipnu looked back and whispered to Linyu, "where is your mother?"

"Thi..." Linyu looked back in confusion. "Thi was right behind me."

The sound of the closer pair of footsteps came to a stop as the others were still far off. "Setre!" Casra's voice boomed through the trees. "I'm sure you're as happy to see me as I am to see you."

"You know I'd rather be meeting on better terms," Setre replied. Her voice was impatient but had a tinge of softness to it, almost imperceptable but to one who was well-versed in the language of tone. "How is Linyu?" she asked.

"Thi has grown," replied Casra. "Thi is much smarter, wiser than I was at that age."

Setre's voice grew quiet. "Can I see h–?"

"–With hunters at your heel?" Casra quickly stopped her with a cold tone. "No. Of course not." Hae tone shifted back to warmth as if surprised at what it had become. "But trust me, Lin can see you right now. Thi misses you."

Linyu drew a sharp breath, hae face flush with emotion, but thi wouldn't dare make a sound to alert Setre. Kipnu placed a hand on hae back in consolation and to make sure thi didn't alert her to their presence.

The footsteps from the forest grew into faint blue lights and Setre made haste. "Where is Kipnu?"

"He is safe. Why does it matter?" asked Casra.

She rose her voice in escalation. "Things have changed and I need him back."

"People cannot be owned, Setre." Casra replied with a confidence in hae voice. "Shinna's claim to him are as unfounded as hae claim to you."

Setre rebuked hae. "This isn't about Shinna. Something's happened. I need help."

A man's voice called from afar, "Setre!"

Setre glanced back for only a moment to find that Casra had disappeared back into the dark forest.

"You find Ginnu?" the man asked as he caught up to her. He was joined quickly by two others.

"No. Just the hint of an old fire," she replied. "Thi can't be far; let's split up and keep searching."

They grunted their assent and set off in different directions as Setre stayed behind, her eyes turned toward the forest as if to search for something she'd lost. Her eyes caught the coil embedded to the side of the tree, and her breath caressed the metal as she spoke into it.

"Linyu," she paused on hae name as if to let her thoughts ferment into words. Kipnu and Linyu clutched their listeners to their ears as she continued. "Something's happened so you might not see your nather for a while. Get your mother to the mainland, ok? It's not safe here anymore."

Linyu sighed to hold back a whimper.

"I love you," she muttered under her breath.

"I love you," whispered Linyu to the cool air.

<!-- Ramne shows up and Ginnu looks afraid -->

<!-- left off -->

Casra smirked and walked closer, letting the blue light from Setre's skin illuminate hae face."You've earned your place on this island, yet here you are hunting your own family. When I left, you had the spirit of a fighter. What happened to you, Setre?"

"There is no fighting against the mainland. Shinna forged is a path to survival," said Setre. "If we follow the path, we live how we want. Unlike you, runninig about in the dark."

"

Kipnu was moved, and waved to Linyu to come up the ladder. There was no danger for hae here. Thi emerged from the hole and Kipnu listened to them, out of their sights.

Setre recognized hae first, and was ecstatic.

"Linyu! Oh you've grown so much!" she said proudly as she rushed in to embrace hae.

For a while all Kipnu heard was silence.

"You," thi said, "You pushed us away from home. Aren't you done bullying us?"

"Linyu... no why would I–"

"Go away. We don't want you here."

"Linyu," Casra said, shocked at his words, "Setre is your nather."

"I saw her in the forest. A bully, like Ramne. If she had found you instead, you would've been just like Kipnu–"

"Linyu!" Casra interjected, but Setre held her hand out in defeat.

"No... thi's right. If Shinna ever discovers that you've come back, you would stand a better chance turning yourself in. If you're really back for good, then you mustn't bring attention to yourself."

"Setre, I think you should know something. I've come to take this place back for the people."

"That's a fools errand," she said without hesitation. "Only someone with immense power on the mainland could do such a thing and live."

"Shinna turned my people against me. Why can't I do the same?"

Setre let out a sigh as if to gather her words together.

"There is a network of spies in the upper class," she explained. "Plotting against each other, vying for power and favor with Shinna. Nobody knows who they are, only that many of them end up dead. Even if you found a way to topple Shinna, hae spies would undermine you at every turn."

"We can't let that prevent us from trying. We can keep ahead of them, anticipate their traps," thi said.

"Don't you understand? Their games will never cease. They will always find some new way to torment you because their profit depends on it."

Kipnu felt a pang of fury for this place, and for a brief moment he contemplated staying to help Casra with hae plan. But it was only a moment. He peeked through the crack of the ladder hole and saw Casra's longing stare in the blue gleam of Setre's skin.

"I should have come back sooner," said Casra. "I'm sorry."

"Don't be sorry," said Setre, "If you hadn't left, Linyu might not be the bright young maman thi is today. And I have my doubts, but maybe there is some shred of humanity left in the land of Ulukoma. If anyone can find it, it's you."

Setre looked toward the entrance to the safehouse and called, "Kipnu!"

He was surprised to hear his name, but knew there was no point in hiding. He opened hole cover and crawled out, keeping his distance from Setre while he walked to Casra's side. Setre said to him, "Your hardships aren't over. This whole island knows how valuable you are. Stay out of sight and help Casra."

He looked up to her in a different light now. Behind her violent facade was a kind-hearted soul, stuck in a difficult situation. It was her way of surviving, and he felt a sort of reverence for it.

"And you," she turned to Linyu, "You stay out of trouble. If people find out your mother is here, they will use you to get to hae. Keep yourself away from them."

Thi looked at hae solemnly, wouldn't say a word but nodded as a peace offering. She knew they had a long way to go.

Casra held on to her once more, and nuzzled each other for several seconds. They wished most of all for everything to go back to the way it was before. But time gives us only the present, and will never take back the past.

Setre turned and disappeared into the dark forest.

Casra called out to her, "The wind speaks!"

Setre responded, "The wind listens!"

They watched her blue light fade away, swallowed by that pervasive darkness of the forest they'd made a home in. He wondered at how Casra and Setre got along in the time before. They seemed so different now.

"Kipnu," he heard Linyu's voice calling to him and he awoke from his thoughts.

"Whenever you go back to your home on the mainland," thi said, "don't forget about us."

Hae doubtful eyes peered deep into his mind, tore down his defenses. Thi could tell that he wasn't entirely invested in all of this.

"Linyu!" Casra rebuked hae, but Kipnu wasn't offended. He knew there was a shred of truth in hae words; a truth that he couldn't stop feeling guilty about.

"I could never forget about you, Linyu. Or your mother, or your nather. When I find a way to get my family back, I'll bring them here to tell you the stories."

"That's what every no-kano says. They never come back."

Kipnu felt a small tear welling up. He wanted to say _I'm not one of those people. I mean the things that I say_. But instead he cracked a small smile to cover it up.

"You know what I do when I miss my family?" he asked and Linyu shook hae head. He reached behind his neck and lifted a pendant from his neck, cherishing the nicks and scratches it had gathered over the years.

"I hold onto this, and everything is okay again."

"What is it?" thi asked.

"It's a binding pendant. It represents the bond I share with a maman and a woman."

"Do they have them too?" thi asked.

"Of course," he said. "So they can feel comforted when they miss me."

He carefully, put it around hae neck, and thi turned it over in hae fingers, looking at the detail in the engravings.

He told hae, "If you want, you can borrow it for a while. So you too have something to hold onto."

Thi smiled with a glance and said, "Thanks!", looking back down to observe all its odds and ends. Casra was smiling as thi came closer.

Thi said, "Okay Linyu, head back in or you'll freeze out here."

Without taking hae focus off the pendant, Linyu walked toward the hole and descended back into the house, leaving Casra and Kipnu to speak.

"Thank you for that," thi said. "You really didn't have to."

"It's no big deal. I'd like to be a father someday. Call it practice."

"You'd make a great one," thi said.

An easy pause was held between them as they listened to the quiet in the air.

"Casra," he asked. "If I told you the world was ending. Would you still have come back?"

Hae eyes perked up, understanding the message he was trying to send.

"If it meant Setre and the others had even one day of freedom, it would still be worth it."

Kipnu nodded in understanding.

But thi added, "I do wonder if bringing Linyu was a bad idea. Thi's old enough to understand the end of the world, but not quite ready to handle hae own mortality."

He responded politely, "If you don't mind me saying, your kaln is much more mature than any of hae age I've ever met."

Casra smiled, laughed inside haeself. "Linyu is still my little baby, I guess." But hae troubled head took hold again.

"How will it happen?" thi asked.

Kipnu hesitated. "Ara. Something they call the obscura."

"I see..." thi said quizzically.

Thi arose to head back inside, but before thi stepped onto the ladder, thi called to him, "I can get you back home tonight on one condition."

He turned to show that he was listening.

"Bring Linyu with you."
