  Cas teaches Kip about radio,
    ( It annoys me that Lin is just a background character so far. )
  Casra secretly plans with Setre to be taken to Lissa as a martyrdom
  A sound is broadcast to people with coils, and they start a mutiny against Lissa. Lissa and Casra are killed in the action.
    Set mourns over hae. Lin is vengeful to Set. Kip mourns from a distance, feeling a bit guilty for being an intruder.
    Casra says hae last words to them and talks about a better future - Kip is reminded that hae death will be for nothing unless he does something to stop the ice age.
    Kip hears messages about Lif from Holragi and listens to hae fear on the radio.

  Interlogue:
    Next day, a boat comes for everyone who is able-bodied and able-minded to help with preparations. Kip gets on the boat with a radio and regrets what happened at the shadestead, but feels hopeful for the future with Setre in charge. Mel is waiting for him at Shaki Harbor.


  Thoughts:
  - The reader will be unsatisfied about Casra being killed off.
    - But it's a satisfying death.
  - Is radio that useful?
    - It will be to listen to Lif who will give instructions for sending a sign of good will
      - A weapon like Holragi would plan to send would be a sign of bad will, and more robots would come later (BOOK 2)
      - Their alternative is for people from all 3 corners of the rim to collaboratively work on a problem and send an ambassador to deliver it.
        - Mel volunteers
        - They can collaborate with telegraph. Why is wireless important?
          - Wireless will teach them about far infrared/CO2/Greenhouse effect ???
          - Wireless is how they will keep in contact with the machines instead of destroying them like Holragi
            - Machines to Mel: "There is more you must learn." Mel gets angry and tries to convince them. "Give me back my Lif."
    - Mel will want to know Holragi's plans.

## Ch11


  "Lin, fetch your radio and a listener," Casra requested.

  Kip was surprised, "What are we doing now?"

  "You wanted to learn about the coils right? If we're to change anything in the Shadestead, you're going to have to learn how to use it."

  "I don't follow," he said, perplexed.

  "You'll see."

  The air had picked up and become colder than before. Kip considered telling Casra about the obstruction of Ara, and the oncoming ice age. He had been keeping it a secret from these people for so long, but he could never find a good time to bring it up - it would only get in the way. *Mel...Which big-headed jerks are you entertaining today?*

  Linyu emerged with a wooden box no longer than hae forearm, and a small wooden disc with a hole in the middle. They looked plain and rather ordinary - not the huge metal monstrosities he had imagined them to be. Thi handed the box and disc to Kip and then went to hae mother to help hae with the large coil. Near the tree they cleared away some shrubs and opened another door in the ground, far too shallow to live in. From the trench, they produced another wooden box slightly large than the other, with a crank on the side.

  "What's that crank for?" he asked.

  "To wake up the milta that lives inside," Linyu joked. Kip took whatever humor he could find in this dark place.

  Casra answered him seriously, "That box is a transmitter. You speak into the box and it modulates-... it puts your voice onto the air for all who are listening."

  Kip was confused. "How?" He asked, "I mean we learned electricity in medical, but... I thought you needed wires for that."

  "I was confused at first too, but it works. Imagine that we live at different sides of an unclimbable wall. We can't see or hear each other, but I know you exist, and you know I exist. We could talk by throwing rocks with messages carved in them. But what might be easier is if we set a time to talk, and you put your hand to the rock while I pounded on it with a hammer from the other side."

  "Ok, I think I follow."

  "Now imagine if you wanted to tell a hundred people something. Would you rather throw a hundred rocks, or tell them all to listen to the wall?"

  "Ok yea... but how is that a metaphor for these invisible voices?"

  "All the universe. The air, the trees, the ground. They're all permeated by this invisible wall. If someone knocks, you need only put your ear to it."

  "Ahh, I see," Kip said, only half understanding.

  "I need some light. Come over here, Kip," Casra said. He walked over, realizing his new flow line had become a useful tool. Thi pulled opened a cover on the "radio" and handed it to Kip to look at.

  "See these two glass pieces?" Thi asked, pointing to a large transparent bulb, and a smaller opaque one. "These work together to pull sound out of the electricity in the air - that knocking on the wall. When you talk into a transmitter box, the machine translates your speech into something it can put into the air, so you need these pieces to translate it back." Thi moved hae hand to the coil around the tree. "All these coils you see around are what keeps the machine listening to those bumps in the air. It's like a bell - it rings when sung to. If you make one differently in any way, it will respond to a different tone of singing, so it's important to make them all the same." Linyu handed the small wooden disc to Casra, as if cued to do so, and Casra continued, "This is a listener. You plug it in to listen to the voices in the air. You want to try it?"

  Kip could barely understand what thi was talking about, but was eager to learn anyway.

  "Ok, so take this radio, and walk about fifty paces back. Don't look back - just listen to what you can hear."

  "Just listen? that's it?"

  "Yes. That's it."

  He turned and walked into the dark with the listener at his ear. He glanced back once to find Casra still watching him and telling him to keep going. He stopped after he was pretty sure he had walked fifty paces, and squatted down to listen closer. The forest he had thought silent was now full of static as heard it through the listener. Little clicks and pops would wander into the signal and he pondered how they came to be there. *Are the trees talking to each other?* And then he heard Casra.

  ***
    A little fish, swimming down below,
    A little bird, floating up above,
    With Ara's light filling up the sky,
    It's you who fills our lives with love.
  ***

  He was moved to tears. It was a lullaby from his childhood - faint and delayed to his open ear, but warm, clear, and instant from the radio box. It struck him with a magical awe he hadn't felt in a long time. Invisible voices, hidden walls, he didn't understand any of it, but he had to learn more. This would surely change the world.

  He ran back to Casra, both of them beaming with joy. There was no doubt in his mind that thi never got tired of seeing someone hear it for the first time.

  "This is incredible. Imagine if everyone had one of these. A single voice could cover the entire planet."

  "That is the next thing I need to teach you. There are limits to radio."

  "Limits?"

  "The coil on this tree is powered by a strong battery. Just as you need a strong voice and a pedestal to be heard from far away, you need a strong transmitter and a high antenna for your signal to reach further."

  "Is that why you built it into a tree?"

  "Yes. Setre climbed this tree a few La'to ago to mount a casting wire to the top. It was a dangerous job, but hardly the most dangerous thing she's ever done."

  "What was all of this for, Casra? What were you planning to do before you left?"

  "Many from my tribe chose to live here after they became sober. They felt forgotten by their cities or their families, so they found a new family, a new city to be a part of here. For me, radio was a way to let everyone from Ara know they would have a home here under Ulu. Setre, on the other hand, believed that Holragi had malicious plans and so she wanted to recruit spies that used radio to figure out Holragi's intentions."

  "What sorts of plans?"
