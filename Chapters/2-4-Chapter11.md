<!--
  Casra teaches Kipnu about radio,
    ( It annoys me that Lin is just a background character so far. )
  Casra secretly plans with Setre to be taken to Shinna as a martyrdom
  A sound is broadcast to people with coils, and they start a mutiny against Shinna. Shinna and Casra are killed in the action.
    Set mourns over hae. Lin is vengeful to Set. Kipnu mourns from a distance, feeling a bit guilty for being an intruder.
    Casra says hae last words to them and talks about a better future - Kipnu is reminded that hae death will be for nothing unless he does something to stop the ice age.
    Kipnu hears messages about Liffa from Holrag and listens to hae fear on the radio.

  Interlogue:
    Next day, a boat comes for everyone who is able-bodied and able-minded to help with preparations. Kipnu gets on the boat with a radio and regrets what happened at the Great Pavilion, but feels hopeful for the future with Setre in charge. Melna is waiting for him at Shaki Harbor.


  Thoughts:
  - The reader will be unsatisfied about Casra being killed off.
    - But it's a satisfying death.
  - Is radio that useful?
    - It will be to listen to Liffa who will give instructions for sending a sign of good will
      - A weapon like Holrag would plan to send would be a sign of bad will, and more robots would come later (BOOK 2)
      - Their alternative is for people from all 3 corners of the rim to collaboratively work on a problem and send an ambassador to deliver it.
        - Melna volunteers
        - They can collaborate with telegraph. Why is wireless important?
          - Wireless will teach them about far infrared/CO2/Greenhouse effect ???
          - Wireless is how they will keep in contact with the machines instead of destroying them like Holrag
            - Machines to Melna: "There is more you must learn." Melna gets angry and tries to convince them. "Give me back my Liffa."
    - Melna will want to know Holrag's plans.

## Ch11

<!--

Kipnu noticed Linyu's face, turning more worried with the second. Thi was old enough to know what an ice age meant, but not quite old enough to know how to handle that knowledge.

"I'm sorry... I may have said too much."

Casra looked down at Linyu, and leaned in to hug hae. Thi looked back at Kipnu and said, "It's fine. It's better to face reality prepared, than to live in willful ignorance."
-->

A rustling sound awoke him from his slumber.

"Someone's here," Casra whispered. From underneath their bed where Linyu slept, thi pulled out two steel-tipped wooden poles and handed one to Kipnu on hae way toward the ladder.

"I'll go first," thi said.

Kipnu watched as Casra went up the ladder and cracked the door to peer through. From the corner of his eye, he could see Linyu, awake and cowering in the corner under a blanket.

"Stay here," Casra commanded Kipnu. Thi went up through the door, and Kipnu went up the ladder to watch and listen.

The figure in the dark had an unmistakable spear - Setre was here.

"Casra. You've come back?", she asked in a bewildered tone. "Are you holding Kipnu here? Don't lie to me."

"So what if I am?"

"I captured him. He is property of our tribe. You know this."

"People cannot be owned, Setre. I thought you were better than this."

"I'm not your right-hand anymore. You have no idea what happened in the all the time you were gone. What we had to do to survive."

"When I left, you had such conviction and even more strength than I had. You knew everything I knew. Shinna could have been brought to justice and the Great Pavilion reformed, but now it's gone back to being a hive of addiction."

"We needed you, Casra," she said, raising her voice. "We needed you and you left right as everything was fell apart."

"You forced me out!"

"I sent you off this island to get Linyu to safety. I waited and waited for you to come back, but you never did. Now you expect me to have picked up your mess all by myself? The only way to survive was to adapt, so yes, Casra, this is who I am now."

<!-- left off -->

"I understand. And Ramne?"

"He became a dealer. Shipped off to Yansha long before his sentence. Probably bribes."

"No..." Casra paused to fully understand what this meant. "All of our work... was in vain."

She regained hae composure and said, "Please... Tell me what happened."

"There is a network of spies in every tribe, hidden from view, plotting and scheming to bring them down from the inside out. Nobody knew who might be lurking behind a corner or sabotaging every plan. Shinna has removed all other tribes from the Great Pavilion and killed people in hae own tribe that thi suspected of espionage."

"Why didn't you take action to stop it?"

"How do you stop an army you can't see?"

They both looked at each other, at a loss. Kipnu could see Casra's longing stare in the blue gleam of Setre's skin.

"Set... I'm sorry."

"Don't be sorry, Casra," she said, "If I were anyone else, you would be sold to Shinna by now and I would be planning what to do with my reward. But I love you too much to do that, and I believe - I know - that you can bring some humanity back to the land of Ulu."

Setre looked toward the entrance to the safehouse and called, "Kipnu!"

He went up the ladder and walked out to meet them, with Linyu not far behind. The kaln ran to Setre and gave her a leg-hug, which she kneeled down to return after some hesitation.

Kipnu leaned to Casra and asked, "You were bound?". Thi confirmed with a nod.

Setre lifted herself back up and said to Kipnu, "Your hardships aren't over. The whole island knows how valuable you are. Stay out of sight and help Casra."

He looked at her in a different light now. His fear for her had been mostly replaced with reverence, though the little bits of it had lingered in an animalistic sense of survival.

"Setre...how will you-"

She put her hand over his mouth saying, "Don't worry about me," and turned to Casra. They stared at each other for several seconds, desire in their eyes for things to go back to the way they were before. But this was now, not then. Setre turned to walk back the way she came.

Casra called out to her, "The wind speaks!"

Setre responded, "Ulu listens!"

They looked on as the forest swallowed her cursed blue light, a living memory of Ara wandering in the darkness.

<!--


"What if we built a counter resistance. A silent "

Setre stopped, considering the idea, but then shook it off.

"Nonsense," she said, "Shinna would be ahead at every step."

"We have to be more invisible. More-"

"We? Casra, I never said anything about joining you. You're lucky I didn't come with a band of warriors to take you and your kaln to Shinna. Thi would give me my own tribe for your neck."

"And yet you are here alone, your spear dry and your speech soft."

Kipnu had never seen such a formidable spirit. In the face of capture Casra retained every thread of hae conviction.

Setre removed her spear and held it to Casra's neck. Thi didn't flinch as they both stared each other down.


"You're coming with me," She said in a broken voice, pushing Casra back on the pathway to the Great Pavilion.

Kipnu leapt up and forward to get through the door and run after them. Linyu wasn't far behind.

He called out, "Stop!"

Setre turned to face him. "Kipnu, don't try to stop us."

She didn't move a muscle as Linyu ran straight to hae mother. Casra picked hae up and took the crying kaln around hae neck.

"Lin...Mom's going away for a bit," thi tried to console Linyu.

"You have to be strong now. Ulu is dangeorus place. Teach Kipnu everything we went over before, and don't leave his side. He needs you."

Casra turned to Kipnu and said, "Kipnu...This is how it must be. This is how we change the Great Pavilion for good. Learn from my kaln and stop the cold you speak of."

He pleaded to hae, "This is what you want? To give up?"

"I'm not giving up. ," thi replied.

Casra set hae kaln down and bid hae run off to Kipnu, but Linyu stood still, unwilling to accept that hae mother was leaving. Kipnu's heart was full of rage at Casra's fate and he willed to do all in his power to save Casra while he was here.
-->

"Lin, fetch a listener and some bluekelp," Casra requested.

Kipnu was surprised, "What are we doing now?"

"You wanted to learn about these coils right? If we're to change anything in the Great Pavilion, you're going to have to learn how to use them."

"I don't follow," he said, perplexed.

"You'll see."

The air had picked up and become colder than before. Kipnu considered telling Casra about the obstruction of Ara, and the oncoming ice age. He had been keeping it a secret from these people for so long, but he could never find a good time to bring it up - it would only get in the way. _Mel... What ire does your day bring? Will you take me back?_

Linyu emerged with a small circular wooden trinket and a handful of bright blue sea plants - a color exactly matching the glowing lines that Setre had marked herself with. - not the huge metal monstrosities he had imagined them to be.

Thi handed the listener to Kipnu and told him,

Kipnu said "Got it," and then Linyu went to hae mother to spread the plants all around the tree.

"That must be where the blue lines-"

"Yep," Linyu butted in. He seemed amused that he could predict this foreigner's thoughts.

Thi left an area clear where Casra had cleared away the leaves and opened another door to a trench in the ground, far too shallow to live in. From it they produced a wooden box slightly larger than their own bodies, with a crank handle on the side.

"What's that handle for?" he asked.

"To wake up the miltas that power it," Linyu joked, but Kipnu didn't get it.

"That was a joke," thi said again. Kipnu chuckled but still was looking for an answer.

Casra chimed in, "That box is a transmitter. You speak into the box and it modulates-... it puts your voice onto the air for all who are listening."

"Come over here, Kipnu," Casra said. Thi took the listener from Kipnu and held it up to the light from the bluekelp.

"See these two glass beads?" Thi asked, pointing to a large transparent bulb, and a smaller opaque one. "These work together to pull sound out of the electricity in the air - that knocking on the wall. When you talk into a transmitter box, the machine translates your speech into something it can put into the air, so you need these beads to translate it back." Thi moved hae hand to the coil around the tree. "All these coils you see around are what keeps those bumps in the air constant. They're like bells - they ring when sung to. If you make one event slightly different in any way, it will respond to a different tone of singing, so each one must be made the same."

Casra handed the listener back to Kipnu and asked, "You want to try it?"

Kipnu could barely understand what thi was talking about, but was eager to learn anyway.

"Ok, so take this listener, and walk about fifty paces back. Don't look back - just listen to what you can hear from it."

"Just listen? that's it?"

"Yes. That's it."

He turned and walked into the dark with the listener at his ear. He glanced back once to find Casra still watching him and telling him to keep going. He stopped after he was pretty sure he had walked fifty paces, and squatted down to listen closer. The forest he had thought silent was now full of static as heard it through the listener. Little clicks and pops would wander into the signal and he pondered how they came to be there. _Are the trees talking to each other?_ And then from the device on his ear, he heard the faint noise of a maman clearing hae throat. _Casra?_

Hae voice began with a single tone, chanting in a steady beat. At first it was quiet, muddied by reverberations and echoes, barely audible through the static. But with every new beat, the thunderous reverberations re-aligned, gradually coalescing to single signal, until at once, Kipnu could hear hae as if hae voice were coming from inside his own head. Thi began singing on top of the beat as if a lone voice stood next to him while a choir of thousands continued chanting from the treetops.

---

He was moved to tears. Thi sang a with such ease, but through the listener it was like a memory hallucinated into life. It struck him first with a magical awe, then a longing homesickness. It had been a long time since he felt either of those emotions.

He made his way back, and saw a beam of joy on their faces. There was no doubt in his mind that Casra never got tired of seeing someone hear it for the first time. Thi knew it would change the world.

"What did you think?" Casra asked.

"That was incredible. Imagine if everyone had one of these boxes. A single voice could cover the entire planet."

"That is the next thing I need to teach you. There are limits to radio."

"Limits?"

"The coil on this tree is powered by a strong battery. Just as you need a strong voice and a raised platform to be heard from far away, you need a strong transmitter and a high antenna for your signal to reach further."

"Is that why you built it into a tree?"

"Yes. Lin climbed this tree many La'to ago to mount a casting wire to the top. It was dangeorus, but I raised hae to fight danger with skill."

"What was all of this for, Casra? What were you planning to do before you left?"

"Many from my tribe chose to stay here after they became sober. They felt forgotten by their cities and their families, so they found a new family to be a part of here. Some would leave Ulukoma and bring listeners with them to spread my message to others in Shaki. For me, radio was a way to let everyone from under Ara know that in spite of any mistakes they might have made they would have a home here if their hearts were in the right place. Setre, on the other hand, believed that Holrag was hiding something and she wanted to use radio to uncover it."

"Did she ever find out if they were?"

"We were too focused on other things to really dedicate any time to it. When I went back to Ara, I re-made a radio and tried to recruit some people to go to Holrag and help us. They thought I was some crazy maman with a dangerous idea. Even when I showed them that it works."

"Well, I'm glad we met then. I have every intention of going back and figuring out what Holrag is up to."

"I've never met someone so interested in what we're doing, so pardon if I ask: what's in this for you?"

"You remember the reason I told you for why I was here?"

"You pinned a man against a wall."

"The man was an ex-fidelant from Holrag. And he pressured my partner, Liffa, into going on some experimental flight to space."

"What? Why would he do that?"

"He says it's because thi's a perfect fit for the program, but I think it's really because he wants leverage. Our other partner is a fidelant for Heiko."

"What's happened that people are suddenly at each others' necks? When we left Shaki, everything was boring and humdrum in the news."

Kipnu paused and pondered again if he should mention it.

He said, "I'll tell you later."

"I may not know you that well, but I'm not naive. What's going on?"

He stood up and walked back toward their home.

"Kipnu. We deserve to know," thi said.

He turned back around, and stared at Casra and hae kaln with despair. They needed to know.

"Ara. It's being blocked by... something."

"And they know this... how?"

"The observers found something up there in space. It keeps growing and will soon block out all of Ara. In less than 60 days... an ice age will begin."

"Days?!"

"I know this sounds outlandish, and I wish I was kidding. But the observers are rarely wrong, and we've already seen evidence of its effects."

Casra started talking to her self, "All our work... Everyone I've ever known..."

Kipnu noticed Linyu's face, turning more worried with the second. Thi was old enough to know what an ice age was, but not quite old enough to understand hae own mortality.

"I'm sorry... I've said too much."

Casra leaned in to hug Linyu, while keeping her eyes up.

"It's fine. It's better to face reality prepared than to live in willful ignorance," thi said. "I appreciate that you were trying to protect me, but my plans won't change. I will not divert from my plan to liberate the Great Pavilion."

Kipnu, kneeled down to sit with her and said, "You came here without a sentence, didn't you? Come with me to Heiko after your work here is done. Maybe we can use radio to talk to those things at Ara."

"I appreciate your intentions, Kipnu, but I would rather die than leave this place. I let it fall into anarchy once before and I must not let it happen again."

"Please... when the time comes...reconsider. Your devices could be the answer we're looking for."

"Then it's good of you to learn it."

He smirked and bowed his head, acknowledging that thi couldn't be swayed.

"Well, I'll try my best to learn then," he said.

"Thank you...Kipnu."

Thi stood up again, and pushed Linyu toward home. "Let's get our first nap, shall we? The next shipment will arrive in a Va'la and I want to be prepared for anything."

"Shipment?" Kipnu asked.

"Of convicted. The same one we came in on yesterday."

"What will we do with them?"

"Start a resistance."
