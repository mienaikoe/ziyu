## Chapter 11

A rustling sound roused Kipnu from a deep sleep.

"Someone's here," Casra whispered, reaching behind their bed and pulling out two steel-tipped wooden poles. Thi handed one to Kipnu, who nearly dropped it on the ground in surprise. "I'll go first," thi said, approaching the ladder.

Kipnu shook off his disorientation and grasped the wooden pole to hoist himself to his feet, feeling dizzy from the sudden panic. He followed as Casra went up the ladder and cracked the door to peer through. From the corner of his eye, Linyu stayed near the bed, watching intently at hae mother's movements from the pliant shelter of a blanket.

"Watch Linyu," Casra commanded and with a swift press against the ladder thi had already set a foot on the ground and began making hae way toward the sound. Linyu and Kipnu crept calmly up the ladder and behind a tree to watch and listen.

"The wind speaks!", called the stranger with a frantic and hushed voice, and Casra came out to meet hae in the forest. "Did you find him?" the figure asked in the frantic voice of a maman. It was familiar but there were no faces he could remember to match.

"Quiet, the forest listens," said Casra. "Come inside."

But the maman stopped hae, "We don't have time. Guardians are following me. I lost them about halfway here, but they could be here any moment."

"Is Setre with them?" Casra asked.

"I don't know," thi responded. "But we have to go now."

Casra took but a moment to think of a plan. "All of you up the tree. I will follow close behind."

Kipnu looked around. "Which tree?" he asked, but Linyu quickly took his hand and led him to a steep incline in the ground. The stranger was already ahead of them, moving in flashes of a faint blue light: old flow tattoos scrawled across hae back flitting back and forth like a sword in the dark.

"Follow hae," Linyu whispered.

The maman moved far faster than him, using the small niches in the bark to move quickly up the narrow trunk of the inclined tree. Kipnu contemplated looking down, but knew better than to sabotage his own mind. The maman stopped at a bifurcation in the branches and donned a kelp coat that thi was carrying, obscuring the blue light on hae skin and giving Kipnu a chance to catch up. From the remnants of light under hae coat, he saw the face of a maman he'd saved from the water mere nights ago. "Ginnu!" he gasped.

Thi made a curt airy sound with hae breath and placed a finger on his lips, signaling for quiet. Below them, a pair of feet were meandering quietly across the leaves with the faint sound of others moving quickly through the forest.

Kipnu looked back and whispered to Linyu, "where is your mother?"

"Thi..." Linyu looked back in confusion. "Thi was right behind me."

The sound of the closer pair of footsteps came to a stop as the others were still far off. "Setre!" Casra's voice boomed through the trees. "I'm sure you're as happy to see me as I am to see you."

"You always did know how to make a woman feel welcome," Setre replied. Her voice was impatient but had a tinge of softness to it, almost imperceptable but to those who knew her well. "How is Linyu?" she asked.

"Thi has grown," replied Casra. "Thi is much smarter, wiser than I was at that age."

Setre's voice grew quiet. "Can I see h–?"

"–With hunters at your heel?" Casra quickly stopped her with a cold tone. "No. Of course not." Hae tone shifted back to warmth as if surprised at what it had become. "But trust me, Lin can see you right now. Thi misses you."

Linyu drew a sharp breath, hae face flush with emotion, but thi wouldn't dare make a sound to alert Setre. Kipnu placed a hand on hae back in consolation and to make sure thi didn't alert her to their presence.

The footsteps from the forest grew into faint blue lights and Setre made haste. "Where is Kipnu?"

"He is safe. Why does it matter?" asked Casra.

She rose her voice in escalation. "Things have changed and I need him back."

"You know I need him to pull more people. Shinna can keep the next hot guy that comes hae way."

Setre rebuked hae. "This isn't about Shinna. Something's happened. I need help."

A man's voice called from afar, "Setre!"

Setre glanced back for only a moment to find that Casra had disappeared back into the dark forest.

"You find Ginnu?" the man asked as he caught up to her. He was joined quickly by two others.

"No. Just the remnants of an old fire," she replied. "Thi can't be far; let's split up and keep searching."

They nodded their assent and set off in different directions as Setre stayed behind, her eyes turned toward the forest as if to search for something she'd lost. Her eyes caught the coil embedded to the side of the tree, and her breath caressed the metal as she spoke into it.

"Linyu," she paused on hae name as if to let her thoughts ferment into words. Kipnu and Linyu clutched their listeners to their ears as she continued. "Something's happened. You might not see me for a while. Get your mother to the mainland, ok? It's not safe here anymore."

Linyu sighed as if to release an overflow of emotion.

"I love you," Setre muttered under her breath.

"I love you," whispered Linyu to the cool air.

Setre took a few steps back and turned to look toward where she'd come from. A large figure walked forward, his skin swallowing the light from hers. Setre looked down as he approached and she walked around him, but he stopped her with just a word.

"Love," he said with a dismissive puff through his nose. His tone sowed condescension into the air as if to mock the word he had uttered.

Ginnu, who had been silent until now, let out the beginnings of a soft but terrifying sound and stopped haeself with hae hand. Each of hae breaths chased the next one as if the man's voice had stolen the air from hae lungs for a single word. Kipnu glanced at hae face, saw deeply troubled eyes and a jaw intensely clenched. Never had he seen someone so bothered by the mere presence of another.

Setre replied to him, "You'd understand if you ever met hae."

The shadowed man laughed. "I wonder what Shinna would think," he said. "You, of all people, clinging to the past. Love left you here long ago, my dear hunter, and it's not coming back."

"You are asleep," she replied. "if you think yourself greater than love." And in a moment she was back in the darkness of the forest, her blue skin weaving a tangled web in the trees. The man looked up into the trees and for a moment Kipnu could have sworn that his eyes were locked upon them, but the man turned from his gaze and walked off into the darkness, following Setre's footsteps.

A soft disturbance shook the branches around them as Casra's face emerged amidst the purple light.

"Kipnu," thi called to him. "There's something you're not telling us."

He stared at hae eyes nervously, thinking of how to tell them. "If I told you the world was ending, would you still want to save this place?" he asked, and Casra's eyes went wide with understanding.

"The world is ending?" Ginnu interjected. "How long do we have?"

"I can't be sure," said Kipnu, "but certainly it will be far too soon."

"What the fuck... Does everyone know?" thi asked him. "Why does no one know this but you?"

"He had a front row ticket to the action," Casra said. "It's why he's here."

Kipnu glanced at Casra, in awe at hae power of deduction. Perhaps he had been rude to dismiss what Casra had asked of him. Or perhaps thi never intended to help him onto a ship back to the mainland.

"Yesterday you made it clear that you want to leave," thi said. "I want to respect that, but I could really use your help before you go. If what you say is true, then there will be more people on today's ship. Far more than normal."

"How can you know such a thing?" he asked.

Thi explained, "Those who come here willfully do so out of desparation. They feel that they've lost everything important in their life. For the addicted, that's a given, but for the rest such a thing is quite rare. There must be hundreds of people boarding that ship today, all of them hoping to fall into the blue before they die."

Linyu seemed unbothered by everything, wearing no sign of distress or sadness. "It's true," thi said. "I've even seen ordinary people begging for kanosin as soon as they make it to shore. Sometimes I wonder if they remember me."

There was an aloofness in Linyu's voice that shocked him. To talk about addiction as if it were an emotion as common as thirst or joy, hae life must be so saturated with its presence. Yet inside hae was a flame of curiousity that hadn't burnt out yet.

Linyu spoke again. "When you go back to your home on the mainland," thi said, "don't forget about us." Hae doubtful eyes peered deep into him. He felt interrogated by his own nagging perception that he'd become selfish in his mission to save Liffa, and Linyu's plea opened a hole wide enough for that perception to flood his consciousness with guilt.

"I could never forget about you, Linyu. Or your mother," he replied with broken phrases. "You know what I do when I miss my family?" he asked and Linyu shook hae head. He reached behind his neck and lifted a pendant from his neck, cherishing the nicks and scratches it had gathered over the years. "I hold onto this, and everything is okay again."

"What is it?" thi asked.

"It's a binding pendant. It represents the bond I share with a maman and a woman."

"Do they have them too?" thi asked.

"Of course," he said. "So they can feel comforted when they miss me."

He carefully, put it around Linyu's neck, and thi turned it over in hae fingers, looking at the detail in the engravings.

"If you want, you can borrow it for a while," he said. "So you have something to hold onto as well."

Linyu smiled with a glance and said, "Thanks!", looking back down to observe all its odds and ends. Thi turned to face the light of Ara so thi could see better.

Casra was smiling as thi came closer.

"Thank you, Kipnu," said Casra. "The people that Linyu meets are always so fleeting. One minute they thank hae for saving their lives, and the next he has to abandon them to the hunters. I worry about hae sometimes."

"Thi is resilient," Kipnu replied. "More resilient than I was at that age. And far more perceptive than I am even now."

"I know that you plan to leave as soon as you can," thi said under hae breath. "But please, before you go. Help me convince the newcomers that things still have meaning for a while. That they can dedicate what little time we have left to something meaningful for a change. We can keep them safe here, away from the Cloth, away from Kanosin."

Kipnu thought for a moment. "Everyone knows that this place is controlled by the kanosin trade. The people that flock here tomorrow will likely be coming for kanosin as well. What do you honestly expect to change with a group like that?"

"People come here for salvation from their troubles," Casra pleaded. "They think that kanosin is it, but you and I both know first-hand that it's not. Those are minds that can change-"

"-But only if you show them how wrong they are-"

"-And that's exactly why," thi said with meticulous punctuation, "they're going to take down Shinna and bring the addicted out of the blue."

"And not a drop of kanosin would be produced anymore," Kipnu said. "It was you who told me that smugglers would love nothing more than to own this whole place. If it were up to them, we would all be slaves. What's to stop them from moving in once we've cut off their supply?"

A pause filled the air, and Ginnu glanced quickly toward Casra, but with a quick look downward Casra telegraphed something back to hae. The interaction was plain to those who understood the many gestures that mamen use to talk amongst each other silently, but to Kipnu, accustomed to speaking with his voice, such exchanges were imperceptible.

Casra smiled at him and said, "When the time comes, we can all fall into that blissful sleep together. But for now, there is salvation in helping others have a second chance at life. However short that may be. Bring them here, and leave the rest to me."

Kipnu was resigned. He had no more control of the situation than he had when he arrived, but at least he felt like he was fighting for the right team. And there was something about Casra that he felt he could trust. He paused, pondering, then put his open hand in front of him in the traditional Heikoi gesture of agreement. But Casra took his hand into hae own and brought it down in front of the both of them.

"This is not the mainland, Kipnu," thi said. "You are Ulukomai when you are here."

A slight rustling of leaves and swaying of branches marked the start of morning. Behind them, a mix of red stars were twinkling near the horizon. He pondered at all of the mysteries of this place, of Casra's bravery, Linyu's intelligence, at this new person named Ginnu. And for the first time, Kipnu thought of himself as part of this island. His fate and the fate of the island were irreversibly linked. Maybe he would die here under this strange purple sky, but perhaps following Casra was the surest way to get back to the mainland and find Liffa again.

After a pause, Casra spoke again. "The answer is yes, by the way." Kipnu looked puzzled but thi clarified. "You asked if I would stay here if the world was going to end. If it means my people, my kaln, have even one day of freedom before the end, all of this struggle will have been worth it."

He accepted the answer with a firm nod. "I feel the same about Liffa and Melna," he said.

"Then you must stay strong until you can meet them again," thi replied. "I will do whatever I can to help."

"And me too!" said Linyu.

"Thank you. Both of you. It means a lot," he thanked them both with smile. But from the corner of his eye he saw Ginnnu glance at him and then look away, as if to avoid speaking with him. He took it as a warning that things may not go as planned, but decided not to burden hae with a deluge of prying questions.

"How will it happen?" asked Casra as thi stared out at the stars. "The end."

"Darkness," he replied. "And cold."

"I see..." said Casra solemnly. "We had better hurry then."
