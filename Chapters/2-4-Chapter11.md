  Cas teaches Kip about radio,
    ( It annoys me that Lin is just a background character so far. )
  Kip hears messages from Holragi
  Casra secretly plans with Setre to be taken to Lissa as a martyrdom
  A sound is broadcast to people with coils, and they start a mutiny against Lissa. Lissa and Casra are killed in the action.
    Set mourns over hae. Lin is vengeful at Set. Kip mourns from a distance, feeling a bit guilty for being an intruder.
    Casra says hae last words to them and talks about a better future - Kip is reminded that hae death will be for nothing unless he does something to stop the ice age.

  Interlogue:
    Next day, a boat comes for everyone who is able-bodied and able-minded to help Shaki power-build a space rail at Yansha. Kip gets on the boat and regrets what happened at the shadestead, but feels hopeful for the future with Setre in charge.


  Thoughts:
  - The reader will be unsatisfied about Casra being killed off.
    - But it's a satisfying death.
  - Is radio that useful?
    - It will be to listen to Lif who will give instructions for sending a sign of good will
      - A weapon like Holragi would plan to send would be a sign of bad will, and more robots would come later (BOOK 2)
      - Their alternative is for people from all 3 corners of the rim to collaboratively work on a problem and send an ambassador to deliver it.
        - Mel volunteers
        - They can collaborate with telegraph. Why is wireless important?
          - Wireless will teach them about far infrared/CO2/Greenhouse effect ???
          - Wireless is how they will keep in contact with the machines instead of destroying them like Holragi
            - Machines to Mel: "There is more you must learn." Mel gets angry and tries to convince them. "Give me back my Lif."
    - Mel will want to know Holragi's plans.

## Ch11


  "Lin, fetch your radio and a listener," Casra requested.

  The air had picked up and become colder than before. Kip considered telling Casra about the obstruction of Ara, and the oncoming ice age. He had been keeping it a secret from these people for so long, but he could never find a good time to bring it up - it would only get in the way. *Mel...Which big-headed jerks are you entertaining today?*

  Linyu emerged with a wooden box no longer than hae forearm, and a small wooden disc with a hole in the middle. They looked plain and rather ordinary - not the huge metal monstrosities he had imagined them to be. Thi handed the box and disc to Kip and then went to hae mother to help hae with the large coil. Near the tree they cleared away some shrubs and opened another door in the ground, far too shallow to live in. From the trench, they produced another wooden box slightly large than the other, with a crank on the side.

  "What's that for?" he asked.

  "Don't you know? it's to wake up the milta that lives inside," Linyu joked. Kip took whatever humor he could find in this dark place.

  Casra answered him seriously, "That box is a transmitter. You speak into the box and it modulates-... it puts your voice onto the air for all who are listening."

  Kip was confused. "How?" He asked, "I mean we learned electricity in medical, but... I thought you needed wires for that."

  "Imagine we live at either ends of an unclimbable wall. We can't see or hear each other, but I know you exist, and you know I exist. We could talk by throwing rocks with messages carved in them. But what might be easier is if we set a time to talk, and you put your hand to the rock while I pounded on it with a hammer from the other side."

  "Ok, I think I follow."

  "Now imagine if you wanted to tell a hundred people something. Would you rather throw a hundred rocks, or tell them all to listen to the wall?"

  "Ok yea... but how is that a metaphor for these invisible voices?"

  "All the universe. The air, the trees, the ground. They're all permeated by this invisible wall. If someone knocks, you need only put your ear to it."

  "Ahh, I see," Kip said, only half understanding.

  "I need some light. Come over here, Kip," Casra said. He walked over, realizing his new flow line had become a useful tool. Thi pulled opened a cover on the "radio" and handed it to Kip to look at.

  "See these two glass pieces?" Thi asked, pointing to a large transparent bulb, and a smaller opaque one. "These work together to pull sound out of the electricity in the air - that knocking on the wall. When you sing into a transmitter box, the machine sings with you, so you need these pieces to remove the machine's singing." Thi moved hae hand to the biggest item in the box - a smaller version of the coils he had seen wrapped around the trees. "This component is what keeps the machine listening to those bumps in the air. It's like a bell - it rings when sung to. If you make one differently in any way, it will respond to a different tone of singing, so it's important to make them all the same." Linyu handed the small wooden disc to Casra, as if cued to do so, and Casra continued, "This is a listener. You plug it in to listen to the voices in the air. You want to try it?"

  Kip could barely understand what thi was talking about, but wanted to try anyway.

  "Ok, so take this radio, and walk about twenty paces back. Don't look back at me - just listen to the radio and see if you can hear."
