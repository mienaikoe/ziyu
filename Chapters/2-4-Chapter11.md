## Chapter 11

A rustling sound roused Kipnu from a deep sleep.

"Someone's here," Casra whispered. Thi reached behind their bed and pulled out two steel-tipped wooden poles and handed one to Kipnu.

"I'll go first," thi said, approaching the ladder.

Kipnu watched as Casra went up the ladder and cracked the door to peer through. From the corner of his eye, he could see Linyu, awake and hiding in the corner under a blanket.

"Stay here. Guard Linyu," Casra commanded Kipnu. Thi went up through the door, and Kipnu went up the ladder to watch and listen.

"The wind speaks!", called the stranger, and Casra came out to meet her in the forest. They embraced each other, and Kipnu saw that it was Setre who had come to visit. Casra wasn't lying to him after all.

"Did you find him?" asked Setre in hushed tones.

""

"I captured him. He is property of our tribe. You know this."

"People cannot be owned, Setre. I thought you were better than this."

"I'm not your hunter anymore. You have no idea what happened in the all the time you were gone. Things have changed now."

"When I left, you had such conviction and even more strength than I had. I taught you everything I knew. Why didn't you bring Shinna to justice?"

She rose her voice, as if to say something she'd been waiting to say for a long time.

"I'm not you, Casra. They trusted you with their lives, but me? I'm the one that put you on a boat and sent you away as everything fell apart. I might as well have been Shinna haeself, the way they looked at me after that."

"You sent me away for Linyu's safety. They knew that."

"How could they trust me? I told them you would be back, but you never showed. They had to move on. But I never gave up on you. I've been waiting for you. For so long."

Her voice began to break now that hae presence had sunken in, and she released her spear to the ground, moving close to embrace Casra.

"The things I had to do to survive," she said through tears, "You wouldn't think I was the same person."

Kipnu was moved, and waved to Linyu to come up the ladder. There was no danger for hae here. Thi emerged from the hole and Kipnu listened to them, out of their sights.

Setre recognized hae first, and was ecstatic.

"Linyu! Oh you've grown so much!" she said proudly as she rushed in to embrace hae.

For a while all Kipnu heard was silence.

"You," thi said, "You pushed us away from home. Aren't you done bullying us?"

"Linyu... no why would I–"

"Go away. We don't want you here."

"Linyu," Casra said, shocked at his words, "Setre is your nather."

"I saw her in the forest. A bully, like Ramne. If she had found you instead, you would've been just like Kipnu–"

"Linyu!" Casra interjected, but Setre held her hand out in defeat.

"No... thi's right. If Shinna ever discovers that you've come back, you would stand a better chance turning yourself in. If you're really back for good, then you mustn't bring attention to yourself."

"Setre, I think you should know something. I've come to take this place back for the people."

"That's a fools errand," she said without hesitation. "Only someone with immense power on the mainland could do such a thing and live."

"Shinna turned my people against me. Why can't I do the same?"

Setre let out a sigh as if to gather her words together.

"There is a network of spies in the upper class," she explained. "Plotting against each other, vying for power and favor with Shinna. Nobody knows who they are, only that many of them end up dead. Even if you found a way to topple Shinna, hae spies would undermine you at every turn."

"We can't let that prevent us from trying. We can keep ahead of them, anticipate their traps," thi said.

"Don't you understand? Their games will never cease. They will always find some new way to torment you because their profit depends on it."

Kipnu felt a pang of fury for this place, and for a brief moment he contemplated staying to help Casra with hae plan. But it was only a moment. He peeked through the crack of the ladder hole and saw Casra's longing stare in the blue gleam of Setre's skin.

"I should have come back sooner," said Casra. "I'm sorry."

"Don't be sorry," said Setre, "If you hadn't left, Linyu might not be the bright young maman thi is today. And I have my doubts, but maybe there is some shred of humanity left in the land of Ulukoma. If anyone can find it, it's you."

Setre looked toward the entrance to the safehouse and called, "Kipnu!"

He was surprised to hear his name, but knew there was no point in hiding. He opened hole cover and crawled out, keeping his distance from Setre while he walked to Casra's side. Setre said to him, "Your hardships aren't over. This whole island knows how valuable you are. Stay out of sight and help Casra."

He looked up to her in a different light now. Behind her violent facade was a kind-hearted soul, stuck in a difficult situation. It was her way of surviving, and he felt a sort of reverence for it.

"And you," she turned to Linyu, "You stay out of trouble. If people find out your mother is here, they will use you to get to hae. Keep yourself away from them."

Thi looked at hae solemnly, wouldn't say a word but nodded as a peace offering. She knew they had a long way to go.

Casra held on to her once more, and nuzzled each other for several seconds. They wished most of all for everything to go back to the way it was before. But time gives us only the present, and will never take back the past.

Setre turned and disappeared into the dark forest.

Casra called out to her, "The wind speaks!"

Setre responded, "The wind listens!"

They watched her blue light fade away, swallowed by that pervasive darkness of the forest they'd made a home in. He wondered at how Casra and Setre got along in the time before. They seemed so different now.

"Kipnu," he heard Linyu's voice calling to him and he awoke from his thoughts.

"Whenever you go back to your home on the mainland," thi said, "don't forget about us."

Hae doubtful eyes peered deep into his mind, tore down his defenses. Thi could tell that he wasn't entirely invested in all of this.

"Linyu!" Casra rebuked hae, but Kipnu wasn't offended. He knew there was a shred of truth in hae words; a truth that he couldn't stop feeling guilty about.

"I could never forget about you, Linyu. Or your mother, or your nather. When I find a way to get my family back, I'll bring them here to tell you the stories."

"That's what every no-kano says. They never come back."

Kipnu felt a small tear welling up. He wanted to say _I'm not one of those people. I mean the things that I say_. But instead he cracked a small smile to cover it up.

"You know what I do when I miss my family?" he asked and Linyu shook hae head. He reached behind his neck and lifted a pendant from his neck, cherishing the nicks and scratches it had gathered over the years.

"I hold onto this, and everything is okay again."

"What is it?" thi asked.

"It's a binding pendant. It represents the bond I share with a maman and a woman."

"Do they have them too?" thi asked.

"Of course," he said. "So they can feel comforted when they miss me."

He carefully, put it around hae neck, and thi turned it over in hae fingers, looking at the detail in the engravings.

He told hae, "If you want, you can borrow it for a while. So you too have something to hold onto."

Thi smiled with a glance and said, "Thanks!", looking back down to observe all its odds and ends. Casra was smiling as thi came closer.

Thi said, "Okay Linyu, head back in or you'll freeze out here."

Without taking hae focus off the pendant, Linyu walked toward the hole and descended back into the house, leaving Casra and Kipnu to speak.

"Thank you for that," thi said. "You really didn't have to."

"It's no big deal. I'd like to be a father someday. Call it practice."

"You'd make a great one," thi said.

An easy pause was held between them as they listened to the quiet in the air.

"Casra," he asked. "If I told you the world was ending. Would you still have come back?"

Hae eyes perked up, understanding the message he was trying to send.

"If it meant Setre and the others had even one day of freedom, it would still be worth it."

Kipnu nodded in understanding.

But thi added, "I do wonder if bringing Linyu was a bad idea. Thi's old enough to understand the end of the world, but not quite ready to handle hae own mortality."

He responded politely, "If you don't mind me saying, your kaln is much more mature than any of hae age I've ever met."

Casra smiled, laughed inside haeself. "Linyu is still my little baby, I guess." But hae troubled head took hold again.

"How will it happen?" thi asked.

Kipnu hesitated. "Ara. Something they call the obscura."

"I see..." thi said quizzically.

Thi arose to head back inside, but before thi stepped onto the ladder, thi called to him, "I can get you back home tonight on one condition."

He turned to show that he was listening.

"Bring Linyu with you."
