## Chapter 9

Setre led Kipnu from behind, with the darkness playing the role of both binding and blindfold. Kipnu searched through the darkness to spot more of the patterns on tree branches as they approached the fire. The branches and patterns seemed to become much bigger as they went on. _Copper is so rare. What are they doing wrapping it around trees?_ As they approached the fire, he could hear the familiar sounds of civilization: wood chopping, steam pipes, but oddly very little conversation. As he got closer he realized almost everyone here was in kanosin withdraw just like his own group. He balked at the thought of what the social hierarchy here might look like. Clearly his new friend wasn't a working class junkie like the rest of them.

"Who are these people?" He asked.

"Kano-heads. They're lowlifes who come for their sentence, work for a while, then leave."

"What about the others?"

"You'll see."

The fire was a behemoth of heat eating through 10 logs at once. It would have escaped and eaten the entire village had it not been dug into the ground and surrounded by thick firebrick. The forge and oven were cleverly situated mere steps away, with their own fires stoked by the much larger one. There were people cooking fish and kelp on the other side simply by putting them directly on the brick and flipping them over occasionally. The smell made Kipnu lose all his focus and he briefly considered stealing a morsel. Either through experience or observation, Setre instinctively said, "Don't even think about it."

At the far side of the fire a giant yurt stood tall and proud, painted with the same luminous ink that was in the woman's skin. Kipnu could hear the noises of a nearly a thousand people inside of it.

Setre took his shoulder and said, "In here, you stay close to me."

He nodded. He didn't really have a choice.

Setre glanced into the yurt, and then turned her head back to him. "Also, what is your name and your occupation?"

"Kipnu. I'm a doctor... why do you need to know that?"

She looked him up and down again, surprised.

"I need to call you something when I introduce you."

She opened a fissue in the wall and they entered a new world of blue. Everyone was nude or nearly so, and had ornately-patterned luminescent markings on their bodies as if a vascular system of light had permeated their skin. The dancing ones blurred into the sweet smelling smoke of a plant he hadn't encountered before, their skin filling the air with an otherworldly glow. And still others were in the throws of erotic ecstasy, divining the truth in each other from behind their own eyes. The scene was unbothered by the entrance of Setre and her capture.

She led him through the narrow spaces between people. As they progressed deeper into the yurt, the air became stifling thick with the odor of smoke and sweat. They came to the back, where a maman no more than Kipnu's age sat reclined in front of a broad post, smoking through a long pipe and laughing with the others around hae. Hae body was completely covered with the same blue luminescent flow tattoos the others were wearing.

Setre whispered something in hae ear, and the maman looked Kipnu up and down with a mischievous smile. Thi motioned to him to join them on the other side of the cloth wall. Setre pushed him to go, and he hesitantly went. To his surprise, the other side wasn't the outside, but another smaller canopy with soft linens across the floor. He knew where this was going.

The maman spoke to him with a charming face.

"Aey Kipnu. My name is Lissa. I own this island and all the people on it, including you. If you do what is asked of you, all of your fantasies will be fulfilled," thi said with hae voice and thoughts trailing off into some other time and place.

"If you choose not to... we have a way to steal all of your fun."

Kipnu stared at hae with cautious eyes, wanting nothing more than to leave this place.

Setre chimed in, "We hunt you down and kill you."

And Lissa continued, "Anyway, just cooperate and we'll all have a great time."

Thi observed him with a feigned frown.

"You seem a bit on-edge. Come share in the spirit with us."

Thi held up glowing blue syringe to Kipnu and encouraged him to take it. He took the device, familiar to him in touch but not in sight, and immediately tried to give it back.

"See this is what I'm talking about," said Lissa, pulling out a dagger. Thi swiftly moved behind him and held it to his neck before he could move to escape. Realizing he wasn't going anywhere, he carefully looked closer at the syringe but an impatient Setre took it from him and held his arm tight enough to break it if he struggled any more.

"Stop!" she commanded, tightening her grip. Lissa was licking the rim of his ear while still holding a dagger to his neck.

Setre moved the syringe to his chest, away from his hearts, and punctured his skin, finishing the injection quicker than any he had ever done. A blue glow began to radiate out from where the injection started, and immediately seized his lungs. He tried to cough without moving his neck into the dagger, and Lissa lowered it, saying "There you go, my little Heikoi. You'll start to feel it."

He continued to cough uncontrollably, struggling to regain control of his breathing. But then he felt his muscles relaxing, almost to the point of being immovable, and his head was rushing with countless thoughts and feelings; if he stopped to consider any of them, they would slip away in the next moment. His breathing became automatic. A passenger in his own body.

"There you go," Lissa said while thi laid him down on the floor. He could feel hae hands traveling across his skin and multiplying to eight, twelve hands. His self-identity began to blur: he wasn't sure where his self ended and Lissa or Setre began. He put his hand around the pendant on his neck.

"Liffa...Melna," he called out.

"Shh," Lissa said as thi moved on top of him, "We are all children of Ulu."

The floor became an ocean of silk and he was sinking deeper into it with every movement. _"All of your fantasies."_ He reached out to Lissa to touch hae blue luminating skin, his mind struggling to regain control of his newly autonomous body.

Thi said, "Never forget... I own you."

The rest faded into the night, hidden forever from the mind where the luckiest of regretful memories live.

_Where am I?_

Kipnu opened his eyes and found himself floating alone on an ocean of thick black fluid. The dark of Ulu lie above him, and a faint halo of light surrounded the horizon. He tried to lift himself up, but the ocean held fast. _Is this the afterlife? Have I died? This feels too real to be a dream._ Slowly, the fluid turned into hundred hands and began to pull him down. He tried fighting against them, but they held on tighter. He held his breath while sinking into the abyss until he couldn't hold it any longer. _Drowning would be ok. Ending would be ok._ His lungs let go, and he let the dark flow in, permeating his blood, until he couldn't feel anything.

He woke up again, but this time he was suspended above Palinan with the full brightness of Ara behind him. Liffa was in a small metal capsule directly in front of him. Thi was screaming trying to tell him something, but he couldn't hear hae.

"Liffa!" he called to hae, but thi couldn't hear him either. He tried to move toward hae, but there was nothing to push against. The heat and light from Ara was suddenly blotted out, and he twisted around to see a giant orb of the black liquid approaching them. It swallowed them both, and Kipnu tried to grab Liffa right as it swallowed him, but thi was lost in the darkness. Kipnu kept swimming through the dark, reaching for the next place Liffa could be, but he was getting nowhere. He lost all feeling before he gave up to the dark again.

He woke up a third time, naked and alone in the luminescent cloth sky he remembered from last night. His clothes were nowhere to be found, and he felt a dull headache behind his right eye. He knew that this wasn't a dream: the pain was too realistic. Glancing downward at his body he saw a single luminescent blue line going down his chest, and knew that the few memories he had were not fantasies. Feeling sick, he dropped his head back down and tried to rest.

"Shit, What did I do?" he said to himself. The spectre of guilt began to seep into his bones, carrying with it incessant chills and aches. He was still confused, but he remembered Lissa's hands and an unending feeling of loss. His body lay lifeless as he struggled to muster the mental strength to move any part of it, even his breathing. He felt detached from his senses like he was still floating in a dream, but he couldn't see the dream unfolding. The darkness still held him in its depths.

"Kipnu! Get up!" A voice called to him from the other room. It was Setre.

She burst into the room, in full armor and spear, and didn't hesitate to pull Kipnu up to his feet. He pushed her away with what little strength he had and shouted at her, "Get away from me."

She pulled her spear on him, and he swatted it away saying, "I've lost... all meaning in my life. How do you threaten that, huh?"

With a flick of the wrist, she made a shallow slice through a fatty part of his hip, making Kipnu shout out in pain.

"With a spear," she said.

She pulled out a cloth wrapping from her sling bag and threw it at him.

"Bandage yourself up and come back into the Great Pavilion. Lissa will speak to you."

"I have nothing to talk with hae about."

"You won't be talking."

She left the room, leaving the still naked Kipnu bleeding and bandaging himself. He bandaged the wound the way he had done for many of his patients, but it was decidedly more difficult doing it on himself. Once bandaged, he realized that he was still freezing and without clothing. _This must be some initiation or something._ He stood himself up and walked to the curtains, reaffirming his own existence before he went into the next room.

The room had nearly a hundred people forming two lines that surrounded Lissa and him. They all had the same blue luminescent markings as yesterday but they were silent now, staring at him like he was their prize animal. _Why is everyone here? What are they looking at me for?_

Lissa and hae crew sat where he entered the yurt yesterday, the rest forming a two lines, a tunnel of people surrounding him on both sides.

"Kipnu. Approach," Lissa commanded, hae voice carrying well from across the room. Setre was behind him, ensuring he didn't turn back.

He turned his head, but kept walking, "Setre, why all this ceremony for me?"

"You are healthy, strong, and smart. A rare combination for people sent to Ulukoma."

As he approached, the people behind him followed behind him to form an oval. Once he had gotten close enough Setre instructed him to kneel, which he did slowly as it caused him pain in his side to do so.

Lissa began the ceremony, "Tribes of Ulu. Yesterday, my ever-faithful knight, Setre, found and claimed the man you see before you."

Kipnu stood shivering and just wanting to get the ceremony overwith.

"Setre, please tell us what makes your find so special."

"This is Kipnu um Heiko. You can see his strength, but his real value lies in his above. He is a doctor."

The crowd filled with murmurs before he was done talking.

"I am bound to Liffa and Melna," he tried to shout over the crowd, but no one heard him.

Lissa gestured to them to quiet down and addressed Kipnu directly, "Yesterday, you were a slave to the light. Today, you become a guardian of the dark. Somewhere in this room, your new owner stands waiting to welcome you into their embrace. But we all must make sacrifices for the things we desire. Those who want Kipnu as their guardian must trade something of their own."

Thi paused and looked out at the crowd in anticipation. _Is this an auction?_

"Let the bidding begin!"

"400 kano!"

"3 servants!"

The crowd bunched in and crowded Lissa and hae scribe who was taking the bids faster than he could write them. Setre had moved away from Kipnu and was now clearing some space in the crowd for Lissa. The noise was aggravating Kipnu's headache, so he crouched down and covered his ears to wait it out. He had never felt this humiliated or powerless before. There was nowhere to run, though he wanted to. There was no solace to take in his conscience, no friend he could turn to. So like a switch, all judgments turned off, all his senses numbed, his fortress of good will abandoned. He had been broken.
