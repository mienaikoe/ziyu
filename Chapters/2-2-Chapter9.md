## Chapter 9

Kipnu walked where Setre guided him, the darkness as his blindfold. He searched through the darkness for trails or landmarks as they approached the fire, but his eye wasn't attuned to the nuance of a forest. What he did notice was more of the strange copper baubles hanging from the trees whose trunks seemed to become much bigger as they went on. _Copper is so rare. Why are they attaching it to trees?_ As they approached the fire, he could hear the familiar sounds of civilization: wood chopping, fire crackling, food sizzling, but very little conversation. In the darkness was the constant, low-pitched murmur of some sort of gathering.

The woman pushed him ever closer toward the noise and slowly he gathered the nature of this place. The fire was a behemoth, eating through branches as thick as his head. It would have escaped and eaten the entire village had it not been dug into the ground and surrounded by thick firebrick. The forge and oven were cleverly situated mere steps away, with their own fires stoked by the much larger one. There were people cooking fish and kelp on the other side simply by putting them directly on the brick and flipping them over occasionally. The smell made Kipnu lose all his focus and he briefly considered stealing a morsel. Either through experience or observation, Setre instinctively said, "Don't even think about it."

Of the nearly hundreds of people mulling about, each one had glassy eyes that glowed faintly blue, just like the kaln from the boat. He had seen patients like this before but never had he seen so many people under the power of kanosin in one place, and he wondered if they were kept like this on purpose; clearly his new friend was different.

"Who are these people?" he asked.

"The working class. They come here for the fix and work to earn it."

"What do they do after their sentence is up?"

"Most of them never leave."

Kipnu was incredulous, but was in no position to change a mind. He knew that the murmur of people had to be some other sort of group.

"What about the others?"

"You'll see."

At the far side of the fire a giant yurt stood proud, painted in long strokes of ochre on the same thick kelp that made up the woman's coat. Kipnu could hear the noises of a nearly a thousand people inside of it.

The woman took his shoulder and said, "In here, you stay close to me."

He nodded. He didn't really have a choice.

She moved to a fissure in the kelpen wall and glanced into the yurt, then turned her head back to him. "Before we go in, what is your name and class?"

"Kipnu. But Heiko doesn't have classes. I'm a doctor if that's what you mean... Why do you need to know this?"

She looked him up and down again as if her eyes had seen him for the first time.

"I need to call you something when I introduce you."

The two of them ducked under the flaps of the wall and entered a new world of blue. Everyone was nude or nearly so, and had ornately-patterned luminescent markings on their bodies, much like this woman's. A single drum pattern rattled the ground while musicians played their melodies and the dancers blurred into the sweet smelling smoke of anomin oil, their skin filling the air with an otherworldly glow. And still others were in the throws of erotic ecstasy, divining the truth in each other. Their eyes were brightly-colored with the same light, and he knew that they too were under the spell of kanosin.

She led him through the narrow spaces between people who were wholly unbothered by their presence. As they progressed deeper into the yurt, the air became thick with the odor of smoke. They came to the back, where a maman no more than Kipnu's age sat reclined in front of a broad post, smoking through a long pipe and laughing with the others around hae. Hae body was completely covered with the same blue luminescent flow tattoos the others were wearing, but hae eyes were clear.

The woman whispered something in hae ear, and the maman looked Kipnu up and down with a mischievous smile. Thi motioned to him to join them on the other side of the cloth wall and she pushed him to go. With some hesitation, he followed. To his surprise, the other side wasn't the outside, but another smaller canopy with soft linens across the floor. He knew where this was going.

The maman spoke to him with a charming face.

"Aey Kipnu. I see my faithful hunter, Setre, has found you. Welcome to the Great Pavilion of Ulukoma. My name is Shinna. I own this island and all the people on it, including you. If you do what is asked of you, all of your dreams will be fulfilled," thi said, hae voice trailing off into some other time and place.

"If you choose not to... well you've seen what happens to those who misbehave."

Kipnu stared at hae with cautious eyes, wanting nothing more than to leave this place.

Setre chimed in, "We hunt you down and kill you."

Shinna laughed and continued, "Anyway, just cooperate and we'll all have a great time."

Thi observed him with a feigned frown.

"You seem a bit on-edge. Come. Share the spirit with us."

Thi held up glowing blue syringe to Kipnu and encouraged him to take it. He took the device, familiar to him in touch but not in sight, and immediately tried to give it back.

"See this is what I'm talking about," said Shinna, pulling out a dagger. Thi swiftly moved behind him and held it to his neck before he could move to escape. Realizing he wasn't going anywhere, he carefully looked closer at the syringe but an impatient Setre took it from him and held his arm tight enough to break it if he struggled any more.

"Stop struggling!" she commanded, tightening her grip. Shinna was licking the rim of his ear while still holding a dagger to his neck.

Setre moved the syringe to his abdomen, and punctured an artery, finishing the injection quicker than he realized. A blue glow began to radiate out from where the injection started, and immediately seized his lungs. He tried to cough without moving his neck into the dagger, and Shinna lowered it, saying "There you go, my little Heikoi doctor. You'll start to feel it."

He continued to cough uncontrollably, struggling to regain control of his breathing. But then he felt his muscles relaxing, almost to the point of being immovable, and his head was rushing with countless thoughts and feelings; if he stopped to consider any of them, they would slip away in the next moment. His breathing became automatic. A passenger in his own body.

"There you go," Shinna said while thi laid him down on the floor. The soft fabric was warm to the touch. He could feel hae hands traveling across his skin and multiplying to eight, twelve hands. His sense of self began to blur and he wasn't sure where his self ended and Shinna or Setre began. He put his hand around the pendant on his neck.

"I want to leave," he whispered to the air.

"Shh," Shinna said as thi moved his hand away, "We are all children of Ulu."

The floor became an ocean of silk and he was sinking deeper into it with every movement. _"All of your dreams."_ He reached out to touch the blue patterns in his eyes, his mind struggling to regain control of his newly autonomous body.

Thi said, "Never forget... I own you."

His memory of reality faded into the night, hidden forever from the mind where the luckiest of regretful memories live.

In its place, a series of dreams.

_Where am I?_

Kipnu opened his eyes and found himself floating alone on an ocean of thick black fluid. The dark of Ulu lie above him, and a faint halo of light surrounded the horizon. He tried to lift himself up, but the ocean held fast. _Is this the afterlife? Have I died? This feels too real to be a dream._ Slowly, the fluid turned into hundred hands and began to pull him down. He tried fighting against them, but they held on tighter. He held his breath while sinking into the abyss until he couldn't hold it any longer. _Drowning would be ok. Ending would be ok._ His lungs let go, and he let the dark flow in, permeating his blood, until he couldn't feel anything.

He woke up again, but this time he was suspended above Palinan with the full brightness of Ara behind him. Liffa was in a small metal capsule directly in front of him. Thi was screaming trying to tell him something, but he couldn't hear hae.

"Liffa!" he called to hae, but thi couldn't hear him either. He tried to move toward hae, but there was nothing to push against. The heat and light from Ara was suddenly blotted out, and he twisted around to see a giant orb of the black liquid approaching them. It swallowed them both, and Kipnu tried to grab Liffa right as it swallowed him, but thi was lost in the darkness. Kipnu kept swimming through the dark, reaching for the next place Liffa could be, but he was getting nowhere. He lost all feeling before he gave up to the dark again.

He woke up a third time, naked and alone in the luminescent cloth sky he remembered from last night. His clothes were nowhere to be found, and he felt a dull headache behind his right eye. He knew that this wasn't a dream: the pain was too realistic. Glancing downward at his body he saw a single luminescent blue line going down his chest, and knew that the few memories he had were not fantasies. Incessant chills and aches began to seep into his bones, so he dropped his head back down and tried to rest.

"Shit, What did I do?" he said to himself. He was still confused, but he remembered Shinna's hands and an unending feeling of loss. His body lay lifeless as he struggled to muster the mental strength to move any part of it, even his breathing. He felt detached from his senses like he was still floating in a dream, but he couldn't see the dream unfolding. The darkness still held him.

"Kipnu! Get up!" A voice called to him from behind the fabric. It was Setre.

She burst into the room, in full armor and spear, and didn't hesitate to pull Kipnu up to his feet. The blood suddenly rushed out of his head and he swayed to and fro to gain his balance amidst the piercing pain in his head. His eyes were open yet he still saw nothing, not even the blue light from Setre's chest.

"It's time to go," she said in a hurried tone.

He pushed her away with what little strength he had.

"What happened to me?" he shouted at her, holding his head in agony.

"The kanosin will wear off" she said, some trouble in her voice.

"I need more... make it stop."

"Nevermind that, you have to come out right now."

"No," he responded harshly.

She pulled her spear on him, and he swatted it away.

"How do you threaten me at a time like this?" He asked rhetorically.

With a flick of the wrist, she made a shallow slice through a fatty part of his hip, making Kipnu shout in pain.

"With a spear," she said.

She sighed and pulled out a cloth wrapping from her sling bag and threw it at him.

"Bandage yourself up and come back into the Great Pavilion. Shinna will speak to you."

"I have nothing to talk about."

"You won't be talking."

She left the room, leaving a still-bleeding Kipnu barely standing. He bandaged the wound the way he had done for many of his patients, but it was markedly more difficult to do it for himself in such a state. Once bandaged, he realized that he was still freezing and without clothing. _This must be some initiation or something. I can't just leave, I have nowhere to go._ He stood himself up and walked to the entryway, reaffirming his own existence before he went into the next room.

The room had nearly hundreds of people forming two lines that surrounded Shinna and him. They all had the same blue luminescent markings as yesterday but they were silent now, staring at him like he was some prize. _Why is everyone here? What are they looking at me for?_

Shinna and hae crew sat where he entered the pavilion yesterday, the rest forming a two lines, a tunnel of people surrounding him on both sides.

"Kipnu. Approach," Shinna commanded, hae voice carrying well from across the room. Setre was behind him, ensuring he didn't turn back.

He turned his head, but kept walking, "Setre, why all this ceremony for me?"

"You are healthy, strong, and you are a doctor from Heiko. People like you don't come here often."

"What makes a doctor so valuable?"

"There are things we don't yet understand about this place. How it... affects us."

As he approached, the people followed behind him to form an oval. Once he had gotten close enough Setre instructed him to kneel, which he did slowly.

Shinna began the ceremony, "Tribes of Ulu. Yesterday, my ever-faithful hunter, Setre, found and claimed the man you see before you."

Kipnu stood shivering and just wanting to get the ceremony overwith.

"Setre, please tell us what makes your find so special."

"This is Kipnu um Heiko. You can see his strength, but his real value lies in his class. He is a doctor."

The crowd filled with murmurs before he was done talking.

"I am bound to Liffa and Melna," he tried to shout over the crowd, but no one heard him.

Shinna gestured to them to quiet down and addressed Kipnu directly, "Yesterday, you were a slave to the light. Today, you become a guardian of the dark. Somewhere in this room, your new tribe stands waiting to welcome you into their embrace. But we all must make sacrifices for the things we desire. Those who want Kipnu as their guardian must trade something of their own."

Thi paused and looked out at the crowd in anticipation. _Is this an auction?_

"Let the bidding begin!"

"400 kano!"

"3 servants!"

The crowd bunched in and crowded Shinna and hae scribe who was taking the bids faster than he could write them. Setre had moved away from Kipnu and was now clearing some space in the crowd for Shinna. The noise was aggravating Kipnu's headache, so he crouched down and covered his ears to wait it out. He had never felt this humiliated or powerless before. There was nowhere to run, though he wanted to, no place to be alone, no friend he could turn to. He was a criminal, and this was his prison. So like a switch, his grasp of reason shut down, all his senses numbed, his fortress of good will abandoned. He had been broken.
