## Chapter 9

The woman walked behind Kipnu, guiding him at each turn with a push or shove of her staff. The blue glow of her skin dimly lit the branches around him, but his body cast a shadow in her light, obscuring the roots and rocks that tripped him in his stride. She led them along a meandering path that confused his sense of direction. The forest was like a blindfold, concealing the Ara-light that he never imagined would be gone. It gave him an unsettling feeling of smallness.

The aroma of smoke stuck to the air and grew in complexity the further they walked, and finally he saw the orange glow of a large fire billowing in the distance. Between steps he listened to the familiar sounds of civilization: wood being chopped, logs crackling, food sizzling, but there was very little conversation. The woman turned him one last time toward the noise and step-by-step he gathered the nature of this place. The fire was a colossus eating through chunks of wood as thick as his head. He thought the flames would have eaten the entire forest had the fire not been contained by a pit as deep as a saffa is long. A series of clay ovens were situated at one side of the circle, with teams of people lazily filling and unfilling them with bread and fish and seaweed.

"Keep moving, don't speak with them," said the woman in a harsh tone. He obeyed, not wanting to learn the pain of her weapon. As the woman guided him past, his eye caught sight of rheir glassy eyes glowing in a dull blue color. He had seen and heard of the bright blue eyes of kanosin addicts before but never had he seen so many actively working in that dreaded place called withdrawal. He wondered how they could even stand in such a state; he wondered if they were kept like this on purpose.

As they moved out of hearing range, Kipnu decided to try learn from his captor. "Who are these people?" he asked.

She hesitated, then said, "Firekeepers. They come here for the fix."

"What do they do after their sentence is up?"

The woman snickered dismissively. "Who said anything about a sentence?"

"No sentence? Who would ever come to this place of their own volition?"

"You deaf?" she asked. "It's the fix."

Kipnu was incredulous at the nonchalance this woman felt about the people who worked for her benefit. A sickening feeling came over him as he wondered where he would fit in this hierarchy.

Ahead of them, a muffled cacophony of music and talking intermingled with the sweet aroma of burning anomin. A gathering of some sort, but muffled by some structure.

"What do I hear?" he asked the woman again.

"You'll see."

<!--
The only tokens of familiarity were more of the strange copper baubles stuck to trees. _Copper is so rare. Why are they attaching it to trees?_ -->

From a giant clearing of trees stood the outline of a giant yurt. The light of Ara illuminated the sky a dark shade of purple, made the kelpen cloth and woody soil seem otherworldly. Kipnu felt the rumble of a deep drum keeping time and the voices of nearly a thousand people, some of them singing and some talking. The woman took his arm in her hand and spoke in his ear. "In here, you stay close to me," she said. He nodded, knowing it was probably for the better. She moved to a fissure in the kelpen wall and glanced inside, then turned her head back to him. "Before we go in, what is your name and class?"

"Kipnu..." he said. She waited for the other answer, but Kipnu was unsure of what she meant.

"Your duty?" she implored, "Your job?"

"I'm a physician if that's your meaning," he said. "What is it to you?"

She looked him up and down with a curious gaze as if her eyes had seen him for the first time. An acute feeling of discomfort grew within him as her eyes made their way back up to his. "Mark your words carefully, Kipnu. You have value, that much is certain. But what you do with your value is up to you."

The woman led him by the hand under the flaps of the wall into a lustrous new world of blue. The room was a sea of skin and light, each woman, maman, and man baring the unique luminescent markings that meandered across their skin. He felt naked in his clothes and wholly opaque, but Setre pulled him ever deeper into the crowd, ever more lost in the blur. The deep drum grew louder as he grew nearer, rattling the ground with its droning meditation while dancers blurred into the sweet smoke of anomin. The rest were fully immersed in each other, drenched in the throws of erotic ecstasy. He looked at their eyes colored brightly with the light of kanosin, and for a moment, felt an inexplicable pang of envy.

"Stay close," said Setre, or at least that's what he heard as she led him between gaps in the crowd, closer to the center of this grand hall. Upon a fine rug of blue light, a maman no more than Kipnu's age lay reclined in front of a broad post that held the weight of this place. Thi flirted and toyed with the men and women gathered around hae, but stopped as thi spotted Setre with a strange man. Thi looked him up and down and up again with lustful eyes, the only part of hae body that wasn't glowinig blue.

"Setre, you clever fiend," thi said in a salacious tone. "What a prize you've brought me today."

Setre leaned in to whisper something in hae ear, and the maman's expression changed from desire to excitement. Thi motioned for him to follow, but Kipnu hesitated, imagining all of the things thi could be suggesting. Setre lowered her mouth to his ear and her spear to his back, and whispered to him, "Now is the time to prove yourself, doctor." And with a deep breath, he took the maman's hand and followed hae to a small table a few steps away.

"Kipnu, welcome to the Senate of Ulukoma," thi said. "I am Shinna, master of ceremonies and keeper of the guardians." Thi moved around him with an intimidating confidence, never taking hae eye off of him. "All under the shelter of this great yurt are equals. We've proven our worth and our loyalty to each other. And you," she paused to look over him again, "You will do the same."

Kipnu stared at hae with cautious eyes. He thought of the people working the ovens outside, wondered how they had been deemed unworthy.

"You seem a bit on-edge," said Shinna. "Come. Share the spirit with us." Thi turned toward the table, moving hae hands methodically and turned back with an ornately designed syringe in hae hands, blue through the glass. Thi placed hae fingers into its clever niches and placed hae other hand on his arm, gently at first but he flinched at the touch and started to back away. "Oh you like a chase," thi said. Setre stopped Kipnu in his path and held tightly to his arms while Shinna walked closer. In one fluid motion, thi climbed onto him, locking hae legs around him and pressing hae body against his. "Don't fight," whispered Shinna. "You are one of us now."

Thi moved the syringe to his neck and punctured an artery, gently pouring its contents into his blood. A blue glow began to radiate out from his neck, down his shoulders and chest, filling them with a numbing cool.

"What... what is this?" he whispered in a shallow breath.

"I've given you enough kanosin to cross into the life beyond death," said Shinna as thi gently caressed his body. "We shall see the kind of man you really are on the other side. Until then, just enjoy the ride."

His head rushed with countless thoughts and feelings that came and went as if they would slip away if he stopped to hold any of them for more than a moment. Setre laid him down, removed his clothes with ease, and laid her bare skin against his as Shinna took him inside hae warm body. He felt sparks in his muted nerves where their fingertips traveled across his skin, and Shinna's breaths still fluttering across his ear.

"Never forget..." thi whispered to him. "I own you."

He watched his arms as they reached out to caress the blue patterns of Setre's body in a loving embrace. His last bits of conscious thought raced with memories of Melna and Liffa. How whole he'd become in their intimate moments, how completely he would surrender to them, and they to him. His eyes turned to Setre, her head on his shoulder, her eyelids closed but faintly blue, and he saw a certain emptiness in her expression. Like a mind that had shut itself down to protect from reality, he surmised. And he saw Shinna's bright body undulating above them in euphoric to the metronomic beat of the drum against the ground.

As for him, the kanosin had begun to close in the thoughts that lived inside his mind, cornering them into that place behind the eyes where only perception lives. He expected the bitter taste of shame to pervade him as he watched his body break his oath to Liffa and Melna. But he had no more command upon his mind to have such conviction, just as his muscles no longer had a will to fight and his eyes had no more energy to inform him.

This is the way that kanosin takes you: first with the limbs and the chest, then with the mind and the eyes.

Then your breathing slows to whispers, and your hearts stutter to a stop.

---

And then you awaken.

The memory Shinna's face was frozen in his mind when he found himself lying on the vinegrass floor where Shinna and Setre had been only a moment ago. A dull headache pounded at the space behind his eyes and he knew from the pain that this wasn't a dream.

The air had changed from sweet smoke and raucous voices to the distant sounds of treebreeze and people talking. He lifted his head to look around but when he opened his eyes he saw nothing but blue light wherever he looked. _Temporary blindness,_ he told himself. _A symptom of kanosin withdraw._ He tried to remember the last memories that he could but his mind was still foggy, trying to collect the fragments and put them together like a broken bowl. Then he remembered Shinna's hands pinning his legs to the ground and Setre's weight against him and he shuddered with a rush of disgust and shame.

"What have I done?" he said out loud as he began to weep and wring his hands in frustration. "What have I done?!"

A pair of footsteps approached him. "Kipnu! Get up!" A voice called. Setre burst into the room with her spear in hand, and pulled Kipnu up to his feet. The blood suddenly rushed out of his head and he swayed to and fro to gain his balance amidst the piercing pain in his head. His eyes were open yet he still saw nothing but the blank color of blue.

"It's time to go," she said in a hurried tone, taking his arm in her hand.

He pushed her away with what little strength he had. "How long has it been?"

"Two days, now we–" she replied.

"-Two days?!" he was incredulous, holding his head in agony. "Why? Why did you do this to me?"

"The kanosin will wear off" she said, some trouble in her voice.

"I need... I need more."

"Nevermind that. Come. We don't have time to waste."

"No!" he responded harshly.

She held her spear to his chest, and he backed away, feeling the air that it moved. "You would threaten a blind man?" He chastised her with a incredulity. With a flick of the wrist, Setre made a small shallow slice through a fatty part of his hip, and Kipnu doubled over, shouting in pain.

"Look at you wallowing in your own misery," she said. "I'd love to spear you clean through so I don't have to listen to you whine. You're lucky that physicians are valuable here otherwise we'd have you working the ovens like the rest of your group." With a pause and a sigh, she pulled out a cloth wrapping from her sling bag and kneeled to bandage up the wound. He flinched as she put her hand on his thigh and began winding the cloth tightly around his leg. "Finish the bandage then come with me. Shinna will speak to you."

"I have nothing to talk about."

"Good," she said. "You're better off keeping your mouth shut."

He finished the wrapping around his waist, tucking the excess between two taut overlaps in the fabric, and prepared himself mentally for what was to come. _This must be some initiation or something. I can't just run away, I have nowhere to go._ He stood himself up and listened as Setre walked toward him and took his arm, gentler than she had held it before.

"Where are my clothes?" he asked her.

"In the fire," she said nonchalantly, and she pushed him to start walking.

The noise of activity went silent as the two approached the fire. The warmth was a welcome feeling to Kipnu who had been shivering since he left the shelter of the yurt, but he could tell there was something or someone in the center blocking the warmth directly in front of him.

"Kipnu! You've made it to the other side," Shinna said, hae charismatic voice carrying well through the air. The crowd made itself known to him through their murmurs and whispers, a few hundred by what his ears could estimate. He'd never felt so vulnerable as he walked past them blind unclothed. Setre let go of his arm but stood behind him, ensuring he didn't turn back.

"Are all of these people here for me?" he asked her over his shoulder.

"Yes," she replied quietly. "You are healthy and strong. But most importantly, you are a physician."

"Why does that matter?"

"You will soon know. If you are worthy of knowing."

Shinna began the ceremony, "Tribes of Ulu. Two days ago, my ever-faithful hunter, Setre, found and claimed the man you see before you." Kipnu stood shivering and just wanting to get the ceremony overwith. "Setre, please tell us what makes your find so special."

Setre paused, then adddressed them. "Kipnu is a physician from Heiko." The crowd filled with whisperings and murmurs before she was done talking but with a single gesture, Shinna silenced them all.

"But of course, we cannot merely trust your word," thi said, and paused to take Kipnu's hand. "You must prove to us that you are who you say that you are." With a strong pull, thi led him toward the other side of a flattened tree stump and placed his hands on an array of glass cylinders, all of them identical in shape and texture. "Before you are five glass vials. You must choose one to ingest. Choose wisely and you will enjoy the rest of your days as a guardian of Ulu." Thi ran hae fingers across his skin and placed them tightly around his neck. "Choose poorly...and you never get the chance to lie to me again." Thi released him and stepped away, leaving him alone at the table. "Begin!" thi shouted.

The pain in Kipnu's head began to throb and accelerate with his heartbeat, beating like the drum that rumbled the ground in the night. A test of his knowledge was the last thing he wanted to do in such a state, but he hoped that this would be the last of Shinna's games. He took a few deep breaths to calm his mind and thought of a methodical approach.

<!--
tries each vial individually by smelling first, ruling out two.
then tries skin test, rules out one.
At the last two, he guesses, chooses kanosin. Was a trick test (all of the vials were poison except the one that is kanosin)

Ginnu gives him antikan and sends him off to Casra.

"Yesterday, you were enslaved by the light. Today, you become a guardian of the dark. Somewhere in this room, your new tribe stands waiting to welcome you into their embrace. But we all must make sacrifices for the things we desire. Those who want Kipnu as their guardian must trade something of their own."

Thi paused and looked out at the crowd in anticipation. _Is this an auction?_

"Let the bidding begin!"

"400 kano!"

"3 servants!"

The crowd bunched in and crowded Shinna and hae scribe who was taking the bids faster than he could write them. Setre had moved away from Kipnu and was now clearing some space in the crowd for Shinna. The noise was aggravating Kipnu's headache, so he crouched down and covered his ears to wait it out. He had never felt this humiliated or powerless before. There was nowhere to run, though he wanted to, no place to be alone, no friend he could turn to. He was a criminal, and this was his prison. So like a switch, his grasp of reason shut down, all his senses numbed, his fortress of good will abandoned. He had been broken.
