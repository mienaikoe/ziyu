## Chapter 9

The woman walked behind Kipnu, guiding him at each turn with a push or shove of her staff. The blue glow of her skin dimly lit the branches around him, but his body cast a shadow in her light, obscuring the roots and rocks that tripped him in his stride. She led them along a meandering path that confused his sense of direction. The forest was like a blindfold, concealing the Ara-light that he never imagined would be gone. It gave him an unsettling feeling of smallness.

The aroma of smoke stuck to the air and grew in complexity the further they walked, and finally he saw the orange glow of a large fire billowing in the distance. Between steps he listened to the familiar sounds of civilization: wood being chopped, logs crackling, food sizzling, but there was very little conversation. The woman turned him one last time toward the noise and step-by-step he gathered the nature of this place. The fire was a colossus eating through chunks of wood as thick as his head. He thought the flames would have eaten the entire forest had the fire not been contained by a pit as deep as a saffa is long. A series of clay ovens were situated at one side of the circle, with teams of people lazily filling and unfilling them with bread and fish and seaweed.

"Keep moving, don't speak with them," said the woman in a harsh tone. He obeyed, not wanting to learn the pain of her weapon. As the woman guided him past, his eye caught sight of rheir glassy eyes glowing in a dull blue color. He had seen and heard of the bright blue eyes of kanosin addicts before but never had he seen so many actively working in that dreaded place called withdrawal. He wondered how they could even stand in such a state; he wondered if they were kept like this on purpose.

As they moved out of hearing range, Kipnu decided to try learn from his captor. "Who are these people?" he asked.

She hesitated, then said, "Addicts. They come here for the fix."

"What do they do after their sentence is up?"

"I never said anything about a sentence."

Kipnu was perplexed. "Who would ever come to this place of their own volition?"

"You deaf?" she asked. "It's the fix."

Kipnu was incredulous at the nonchalance this woman felt about these people. _They need help_.

"What about you?" he asked.

She hesitated to answer. "I am a hunter. That's all you need to know."

A sickening feeling came over him as he wondered where he would fit in this hierarchy. Ahead of them, a muffled cacophony of music and talking intermingled with the sweet aroma of burning anomin. A gathering of some sort, but he couldn't be sure how many people it was.

"What am I hearing?" he asked the woman again.

"You'll see."

<!--
The only tokens of familiarity were more of the strange copper baubles stuck to trees. _Copper is so rare. Why are they attaching it to trees?_ -->

From a giant clearing of trees stood the outline of a giant yurt. The light of Ara illuminated the sky a dark shade of purple, made the kelpen cloth and woody soil seem otherworldly. Kipnu felt the rumble of a deep drum keeping time and the voices of nearly a thousand people, some of them singing and some talking. The woman took his arm in her hand and spoke in his ear. "In here, you stay close to me," she said. He nodded, knowing it was probably for the better. She moved to a fissure in the kelpen wall and glanced inside, then turned her head back to him. "Before we go in, what is your name and class?"

"Kipnu..." he said. She waited for the other answer, but Kipnu was unsure of what she meant.

"Your duty?" she implored, "Your job?"

"I'm a physician if that's your meaning," he said.

She looked him up and down with a curious gaze as if her eyes had seen him for the first time. An acute feeling of discomfort grew within him as her eyes made their way back up to his. "Mark your words carefully, Kipnu. You have value, that much is certain. But do you know what to do about it?"

"Value?" asked Kipnu, but before he could ask more, she pulled his arm under the flaps of the wall into a lustrous new world of blue.

The room was a sea of skin and light, each woman, maman, and man baring the unique luminescent markings that meandered across their skin. He felt naked in his clothes and wholly opaque, but Setre pulled him ever deeper into the crowd, ever more lost in the blur. The deep drum grew louder as he grew nearer, rattling the ground with its droning meditation while dancers blurred into the sweet smoke of anomin. The rest were fully immersed in each other, drenched in the throws of erotic ecstasy. He looked at their eyes colored brightly with the light of kanosin, and for a moment, felt an inexplicable pang of envy.

"Stay close," said Setre, or at least that's what he heard as she led him between gaps in the crowd, closer to the center of this grand hall. Upon a fine rug of blue light, a maman no more than Kipnu's age lay reclined in front of a broad post that held the weight of this place. Thi flirted and toyed with the men and women gathered around hae, but stopped as thi spotted Setre with a strange man. Thi looked him up and down and up again with lustful eyes, the only part of hae body that wasn't glowinig blue.

"Setre, you clever fiend," thi said in a salacious tone. "What a prize you've brought me today."

Setre leaned in to whisper something in hae ear, and the maman's expression changed from desire to excitement. Thi motioned for him to follow, but Kipnu hesitated, imagining all of the things thi could be suggesting. Setre lowered her mouth to his ear and her spear to his back, and whispered to him, "Now is the time to show us who you are." And with a deep breath, he took the maman's hand and followed hae to a small table a few steps away.

"Kipnu, welcome to the Senate of Ulukoma," thi said mockingly. "I am Shinna, master of ceremonies and keeper of the hunters." Thi moved around him with an intimidating confidence, never taking hae eye off of him. "All under the shelter of the Cloth are equals. We've proven our worth and our loyalty to each other. And you," thi paused to look over him again, "You will do the same."

Kipnu stared at hae with cautious eyes. He thought of the people working the ovens outside, wondered how they had been deemed unworthy.

Shinna's eyes moved toward his pendant. "Oh, you're a bound man are you? How charmingly quaint."

Kipnu replied with steadfast eyes and a tone of conviction. "You are asleep," he said, "if you think yourself greater than love."

"Love?" thi laughed dismissively. "A bond is something you say once, in a time of your life you hardly remember, with a feeling you'll never have again. It's nothing more than a couple scribbles on some metal trinkets; a gamble that you'll always be content with each other. That's not love; it's a wish that eventually dies. If love is throwing your life at something dead simply because it was there first then yes, there is something greater: _Loyalty_."

He pulled against Setre's grasp again but her arms and hands held him firm. Never in his life had he felt such strength.

"You seem a bit on-edge," said Shinna. "Come. Share the spirit with us." Thi turned toward the table, moving hae hands methodically and turned back with an ornately designed syringe in hae hands, blue through the glass. Thi placed hae fingers into its clever niches and placed hae other hand on his arm, gently at first but he flinched at the touch and started to back away. "Oh you like a chase," thi said. Setre stopped Kipnu in his path and held tightly to his arms while Shinna walked closer. In one fluid motion, thi climbed onto him, locking hae legs around him and pressing hae body against his. "Don't fight," whispered Shinna. "You are one of us now."

Thi moved the syringe to his neck and punctured an artery, gently pouring its contents into his blood. A blue glow began to radiate out from his neck, down his shoulders and chest, filling them with a numbing cool.

"What... what is this?" he whispered in a shallow breath.

"I've given you enough kanosin to cross into the life beyond death," said Shinna as thi gently caressed his body. "We shall see the kind of man you really are on the other side. Until then, just enjoy the ride."

His head rushed with countless thoughts and feelings that came and went as if they would slip away if he stopped to hold any of them for more than a moment. Shinna laid him down and rested hae body against his, sending sparks through his muted nerves where hae fingertips and hae breath fluttered across his skin.

"We belong to you," thi whispered to him. "And you belong to us."

He watched his arms as they reached out to caress the blue patterns of Setre's body. "I...am..." he felt his tongue struggling in his throat, preferring to lie down in its bed. His last bits of conscious thought were filled with memories of Melna and Liffa. How whole he'd become in their intimate moments, how completely he would surrender to them, and they to him.

His eyes turned to Setre who sat beside him with another glowing blue syringe and a certain emptiness in her expression. Like a mind that had shut itself down to protect from reality, he surmised. She injected Shinna with its contents and hae eyes went back into hae head. Thi began to undulate above him to the metronomic beat of the drum, lost in some euphoric world of hae own.

As for him, the kanosin had begun to close in the thoughts that lived inside his mind, cornering them into that place behind the eyes where only perception lives. He expected the bitter taste of shame to pervade him as he watched his body break his oath to Liffa and Melna. But he had no more command upon his mind to have such conviction, just as his muscles no longer had a will to fight and his eyes had no more energy to inform him.

This is the way that kanosin takes you: first with the limbs and the chest, then with the mind and the eyes.

Then your breathing slows to whispers, and your hearts stutter to a stop.

---

And then you awaken.

The memory Shinna's face was frozen in his mind when he found himself lying on the vinegrass floor where Shinna and Setre had been only a moment ago. A dull headache pounded at the space behind his eyes and he knew from the pain that this wasn't a dream.

The air had changed from sweet smoke and raucous voices to the distant sounds of treebreeze and people talking. He lifted his head to look around but when he opened his eyes he saw nothing but darkness wherever he looked. _Temporary blindness,_ he told himself. _A symptom of kanosin withdraw._ He tried to remember the last memories that he could but his mind was still foggy, trying to collect the fragments and put them together like a broken bowl. Then he remembered Shinna's hands pinning his legs to the ground and Setre's weight against him and he shuddered with a rush of disgust and shame.

"What have I done?" he said out loud as he began to weep and wring his hands in frustration. "What have I done?!"

A pair of footsteps approached him. "Kipnu! Get up!" A voice called. Setre burst into the room with her spear in hand, and pulled Kipnu up to his feet. The blood suddenly rushed out of his head and he swayed to and fro to gain his balance amidst the piercing pain in his head. His eyes were open yet he still saw nothing but dakrness.

"It's time to go," she said in a hurried tone, taking his arm in her hand.

He pushed her away with what little strength he had. "How long has it been?"

"Two days, now we–" she replied.

"-Two days?!" he was incredulous, holding his head in agony. The memories of that night felt like a dream he'd just woken up from, but as he looked around the dream stitched itself back into a reality and the guilt the kanosin had held back came washing over him. "Why?" he asked through anguished breaths. "Why did you do this to me?"

"The kanosin will wear off" she said, some trouble in her voice.

"I need... I need more."

"Nevermind that. Come. We don't have time to waste."

"No!" he shouted at her and moved to tackle her. She pushed him back and swung her spear to his chest and he could feel the air that it moved.

"Why are you doing this to me?!" He chastised her as his body shook and groveled at her feet. "I need more! Get me more!"

"Shut. Up!" she yelled, and with a flick of the wrist, Setre made a small shallow slice through a fatty part of his hip, and Kipnu doubled over, shouting in pain. "Look at you wallowing in your own misery," she said. "I'd love to spear you clean through so I don't have to listen to it. You're lucky your class makes you valuable here otherwise we'd have you working the ovens like the rest of your group." With a pause and a sigh, she pulled out a cloth wrapping from her sling bag and kneeled to bandage up the wound. He flinched as she put her hand on his thigh and began winding the cloth tightly around his leg. "Finish the bandage then come with me. Shinna will speak to you."

"I have nothing to talk about."

"Good," she said. "You're better off keeping your mouth shut."

He finished the wrapping around his waist, tucking the excess between two taut overlaps in the fabric, and prepared himself mentally for what was to come. _This must be some initiation or something. I can't just run away, I have nowhere to go._ He stood himself up and listened as Setre walked toward him and took his arm, gentler than she had held it before.

"Where are my clothes?" he asked her.

"In the fire," she said nonchalantly, and she pushed him to start walking.

The noise of activity went silent as the two approached the fire. The warmth was a welcome feeling to Kipnu who had been shivering since he left the shelter of the yurt, but he could tell there was something or someone in the center blocking the warmth directly in front of him.

"Kipnu! You've made it to the other side," Shinna said, hae charismatic voice carrying well through the air. The crowd made itself known to him through their murmurs and whispers, a few hundred by what his ears could estimate. He'd never felt so vulnerable as he walked past them blind unclothed. Setre let go of his arm but stood behind him, ensuring he didn't turn back.

"Are all of these people here for me?" he asked her over his shoulder.

"Yes," she replied quietly. "You are healthy and strong. But most importantly, you are a physician."

"Why does that matter?"

"You will soon know. If you are worthy of knowing."

Shinna began the ceremony, "Tribes of Ulukoma! Two days ago, my ever-faithful hunter, Setre, found and claimed the man you see before you." Kipnu stood shivering and just wanting to get the ceremony overwith. "Setre, please tell us what makes your find so special."

Setre paused, then adddressed them. "Kipnu proclaims to be a physician from Heiko." The crowd filled with whisperings and murmurs before she was done talking but with a single gesture, Shinna silenced them all.

"But of course, we cannot merely trust your word, Kipnu um Heiko," thi said, and paused to take his hand. "You must prove to us that you are who you say that you are." With a strong pull, thi led him toward the other side of a flattened tree stump and placed his hands on an array of glass cylinders, all of them identical in shape and texture. "Before you is a menagerie of glass vials. Only one will grant you eternal happiness under Ulu." Thi ran hae fingers across his skin and caressed his neck with hae thumb. "Choose poorly... and you will never get the chance to lie again." Thi released him and stepped away, leaving him alone at the table. "Begin!" thi shouted.

The pain in Kipnu's head was throbbing with the beating of his hearts. A test of his knowledge was the last thing he wanted to do in such a state, but he hoped that this would be the last of Shinna's games. He took a few deep breaths to calm his mind and thought of a methodical approach. _I cannot see, but I can touch and smell_. He used his fingers to feel the shapes of the vials on the table, turned them over in his hand to feel the weight and thickness of their contents one-by-one. He had hoped that he could eliminate at least one of the vials, but they all seemed to filled with liquids of various types. _I need a tool_.

"Setre," he said, and with some hesitation she responded, "What now?"

"Can you tell me what color these all are?" She hesitated, maybe to glance at Shinna, but not a word was exchanged that Kipnu could hear. She carefully took the vials into one hand and positioned him closer to her with her other.

"Red," she said, placing one down into his hand. Kipnu uncorked it and wafted its contents toward himself. _Salty and tannic. Of the ocean._ He covered and placed it before him, remembering the reddish algae he used as an anesthetic. A dose this size would kill him, he was certain.

Setre hesitated before giving him the next one. "Clear," she said as she gently set the next one down. Kipnu could detect an unease in her voice and in her hand, as if merely holding the vial was dangerous. He uncorked it and wafted as he had before, and winced at a distinct smell of char. He lifted the vial and poured a small drop of the liquid onto the table which exploded upon impact and the crowd around him jumped in fear. Carefully, he covered the vial up again and placed it on the table near his left hand in case he had a use for it later. The quiet of the crowd was palpable, as if they'd found some interest in the mundane prodding and testing of his science.

"Black," said Setre, placing the final vial in his hands. There was no tremor now but a deliberate tone in her voice tipped him off, as if she held this vial in high regard. "Black," replied Kipnu as he uncorked the vial. He was certain to be careful with this one, moving slowly and keeping a firm grip. He let the smell into his nose and for a brief moment, he could see at the corner of his eye. The glow of the fire was unmistakeable in that darkness. _A neutralizer for kanosin? No... I would have heard about it._

"It's time to decide, Kipnu," said Shinna. A syringe was in hae hand, making twinkling sounds against hae coat buttons.

He thought about hae words, _eternal happiness under Ulu_. What did thi mean? He took a deep breath of the air above the black liquid to see if his vision came back again. A blob of orange emerged from the darkness, and a strange twinkle of blue near Shinna's waist. _What is that?_

"What will it be?" thi asked. Kipnu walked toward hae slowly with the vial of black liquid in his hands and poured a drop out in front of hae. The crowd erupted into a frenzy of shouting and commotion as Setre pushed them away. He capped the vial of neutralizer and then took one more step toward her, taking hae hand and the vial of kanosin that lie within it. Shinna leaned into him and laughed gently. "You are the genuine article, Kipnu um Heiko. You've earned that." Thi took both vials from his hand, placed one of them in a syringe and moved the needle to his arm. A warm liquid filled his blood, carried a tingling sensation that washed over him as the pain in his head subsided and his vision began to return. Thi removed the needle, and swapped out the empty vial for the vial of kanosin. Kipnu backed away, not wanting to endure the grip of the blue again but Setre stopped him abruptly and held his body stationary.

"It's not what you think," she said. He looked at the sincerity in her expression and realized how different she looked now, how gentle her features when touched by the light of the fire. "You done staring?" she said. He caught himself and moved back toward Shinna to accept whatever it was they had planned.

"There is no cure for life," said Shinna as thi slipped the needle into his chest at a shallow angle. He felt a cold rush spreading and saw a blue light begin to draw the ornate pattern of a flow tattoo. "But the blue comes close." As thi removed the syringe, a drop of kanosin wept from the place where the syringe had entered him. Without hesitation, thi licked it off his skin and stared into his eyes with a smirk. "Never forget," thi whispered, then returned to hae place in front of the fire.

"Kipnu," thi said his name with a projecting voice, and the crowd stepped in closer. They all were clothed in black kelp with blue markings on their skin. _Are these the same people from the yurt? None of them are suffering from withdrawal._

"You have proven your worth and your loyalty to us, to this place. Yesterday, you were enslaved by the light. Today, you serve the dark." Setre came up behind him and lifted his arms one-by-one, clothing him with a well-fitting thick black kelpen poncho that covered his body. She turned him around the crowd whooped and hollered for Kipnu. But he felt no warmth by their voices; he felt shackled to this place, to these people that too could never leave.

Setre walked him into the crowd, and he watched as they turned from polishing their spears or eating their bread, their cold eyes throwing a rehearsed greeting. Suddenly, a hand placed itself in his and left behind a slip of paper. He turned around to find who it was, his eyes scanning over the crowd, but he couldn't be sure of who it could have been.

"What's gotten into you?" asked Setre.

"I'm still a bit woozy from the kanosin," he said.

"Must not have been enough antikan. You'll be fine by day's end."

A maman's voice chimed out from behind him, "Congratulations Kipnu." The tone seemed oddly familiar, but he couldn't place who it was. He turned around but before he could see who it was, an explosion filled the area with smoke and dust. Setre pulled him behind herself as the crowd scattered.

"Stay here," said Setre, and she bolted into the smoke to investigate.

He took the time to read the paper that had been given to him: _2000 paces east. Fallen tree_ is all it read.

_The smoke is a distraction_, he thought. _A chance for me to get away_.

He knew that it was a stretch, but a shred of hope was all he needed in that moment. Without a second thought he oriented himself eastward with Ara against his right cheek and through the flurry of people running to and fro, he ran back into that dark forest, not stopping to look back.
