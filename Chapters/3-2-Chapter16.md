## Chapter 16


<!-- TODO: ADd Linyu to this chapter -->

  Mel awoke in a dark corner of the great room with a sliver of Ara peering through the windows. For a moment she found herself in that space between dream and reality, imagining Lif at the front door watching hae garden in the light while Kip lay beside her, still sound asleep. The ghosts of tall grasses chirped in her mind, their thirst quenched by millions of deafening droplets hanging in the air. But there were hints of betrayal in her dreams as well: a chill in the air, a dim in the light, a small annoying twist in her tunic. She sat up and looked toward Lif at the door who was looking back at the two of them with tears in hae eyes.

  "Kip... Mel... I love you." Thi turned and left, shutting the door behind hae.

  "Where are you going?" She called to hae, but thi had gone and the room was empty. She sat up and looked toward the door, still closed, and found herself on the floor near the washroom, dressed in an overly wrinkled version of the clothes she wore the day before. *Why am I on the floor?*

  "Linyu?" She called loudly, suddenly remembering hae. "Linyu?!"

  She lifted herself up by one arm and scurried around the house looking for where Linyu might have gone. There was no sign of hae listener and Liffa's robes were still in the washroom. *Thi left. But there's still so much I don't know about hae.*

  With some hesitation, she decided to carry on with her day and look for Linyu later. Pomri would give her an earful on the whole journey if she was late for her own appointment. She quickly grabbed her senate robes from the bedroom and a canteen of water, stuffing them in her bag, and walked outside into the foggy morning.

  She approached the stable, calling, "Laen-Laen," and he made three short whoops to wake up.

  "You awake yet?" she asked him as she entered the stable. Nestled between Laen-Laen's stretching legs was Linyu, just barely awake.

  "Linyu, what are you doing out here?"

  Thi started to talk but remembered the pain as only a whisper emerged. Thi cleared hae throat gently and tried again.
  
  "Warmer," thi said with a scratch of a voice, holding hae hand against Laen-Laen's belly.
  
  "I was so worried where you had gone."

  "Why?"

  She was perplexed. "Why? Because you're... alone. And I have no clue where your parents are... And you can't scream for help."

  "I'm fine," thi said with conviction. Mel was even more confused now. Wondering where such an independent child could have come from.
  
  "Well, we're going on a big trip today so let's eat up to prepare," she told hae. She ran toward the garden to fetch whatever vegetables might still be living, with Linyu and the saffa in toe.

  "Is this what you eat, Laen?" she asked him, pointing at the vast field of Pohua. He sniffed the stems, hungry but loyal in his patience.

  "Let's find you a couple big ones... wow these are all pretty big. And they seem pretty healthy even in the cold."

  She plucked a couple big ones at the low point of the field and quickly dusted them off, storing them in her bag.
  
  "Here you are," she said, tossing two of the largest ones to him. He chomped down on them, taking enough time to chew, and the sweet aroma of fresh Pohua and not-so-fresh saffa breath filled her nose. She took his eating time to find something that she and Linyu could eat, but everything else had seemed to be wilting under the low-light and their grain stores had been emptied by the senate's last mandate.

  "Well, I guess we'll have to get something in town," she told a disappointed Linyu.
  
  She fetched the thick linen riding cloth from the stable and wrapped securely around Laen-Lean's back and chest. Once he had finished with his breakfast, he hummed in satisfaction as he sniffed around for scraps that might have fallen between his teeth.

  With a firm grab of his neck hair, she hopped onto his back and settled herself in. 
  
  Holding her arms out to Linyu, she said, "Come on, I'll pull you up," and with a pull she lifted hae up to sit in front of her.

  "Alright, Laen-Laen. Let's take a steady trip to the station."

  He started walking, still licking his teeth and clearly not focused on the path while Linyu finished hae last bits of sleep and Mel turned her mind to the day ahead. Putting pressure on Holragi while they held ultimate power in the senate was a nearly impossible task, but it had to be done.

  The station was the nearly empty. The only sign of life was two people talking in a corner near the entrance and a station attendant who knew no other job. The walls had notices painted on them, "No Trains – Provincial Travel Lockdown", in big white lettering, while the fog-diffused and obstruction-dimmed light of Ara painted soft shapes on top. The cold loitered in the unmoving air, the beginning of the end of morning winds in Heiko.

  She called, "Pomri!", in case she was waiting elsewhere. Her echoes bounced off of the walls, absent of people to muffle them. She looked around and saw no sign of her. *Well I guess I'm early.* She hopped off of Laen-Laen and then helped Linyu off as well before patting his cheek. The two cautiously approached the pair in the corner. There was a young man in an mechanic's uniform who looked like he had skipped sleep the night before and a woman about his height and build, twiddling with a small steel bar.

  She greeted them, "Hi there. Do you happen to know the time?"

  They gave them a once-over and the man asked, "No trains now. Go home."

  "I'm just looking for the time," she persisted, now suspicious of them.

  The two glanced at each other and the maman approached her with a swagger meant to intimidate.

  Thi said, "You look familiar," and glanced at her bag from which hastily-packed robes were peaking out.

  "You're that senator who gave away all our grain."

  Mel suddenly felt her muscles tighten and she glanced back at Laen-Laen who wasn't paying attention to them.

  "Wonder if you hoarded any," she said, as she grasped for the bag. Melna pulled it away from hae fingers, but the cold, long finger of the steel bar across her neck stopped her from fleeing. Linyu tried throwing a punch, but the man pushed got in hae way and pushed hae back.

  "We have no food. Only robes and water," she tried to reason with them.

  "Your saffa will do", the man said, looking at Laen-Laen. "Call it over."

  "You would kill a saffa to eat?"

  "You didn't exactly give us a choice. Did you, senator," he said as if he had been waiting for this moment to take his revenge.

  Mel hesitated, thinking of a way out, and then made a peculiar humming sound with her fingers at her neck. Laen-Laen looked over to her for a moment and then slowly approached them, looking around at every corner.

  "Hurry it up!" The woman demanded with the bar still at Melna's neck.

  Suddenly, a voice called from behind them, "Melna. glad I found you."

  The pair turned around to find Pomri, on her own saffa and armed with a titanium spear. In a split-second, they dashed away from the station at a sprint pace. Looking back to ensure they weren't being followed.

  "You're woefully unprepared," said Pomri.

  "And you're woefully late," Mel responded.

  "Who is this?" Pomri asked, only glancing at Linyu.

  "This is Linyu."

  Pomri patiently waited for more details. 
  
  Melna started again, "I found Laen-Laen protecting hae last night and now they're pretty much inseparable."

  "And you're taking this strange kaln with us to Shaki?"

  "I think thi might know something about Holragi that we don't know."

  Pomri wore her blank stare, incredulous that a senator would even suggest something so ridiculous.

  Mel let out an exasperated sigh. "I know this sounds the smallest bit harebrained but I'll show you once I hear it again."


  <!-- Pomri foreshadows her loyalty? -->

She changed the subject in attempt to build trust, "Here. Let me show you something."

She reached under her shirt to reveal her family pendant. Silver, and slightly worn from use.

"Have you seen one of these before? It's a pendant that my nather made for me. We keep track of our family trees with tiny engravings on the inside."

Slowly, she removed it from her neck and held it out to Linyu, who was still staring into the distance.

"Want to see it?"

Linyu was confused but took a look anyway. Mel watched as thi looked intently at the engravings. Suddenly, thi reached into hae shirt and pulled out a pendant of hae own and began to compare the two. Melna was shocked to see Kipnu's pendant in the hands of this strange kaln.

"Where did you get that?!" She asked, grasping to see Kip's pendant

Linyu quickly finished checking the two and hae eyes started to water. Without a moment's pause, thi flung haeself at Melna and made whimpering breaths into her shoulder.

"Kip," thi whispered through tears. She let hae cry a bit more but her mind kept racing back and forth to all of the possibilities that could have led to this moment.

"Is he ok?" She asked.

Thi shook hae head.

"Was it the fire?"

Thi shook hae head again.

"Do you know where he is?"

"Mom," thi whispered with a tremble.

"Your mother – he's with your mother?"

Thi began to cry more and Mel held her shoulder out to cry on. For the moment, she believed Kip to be safe.

"Linyu, please. Let me have this. I am bound to Kipnu."



"Linyu, I'm sorry. I- I just... miss him."

It smelled faintly of the ocean, but nothing else stood out to her. *What happened to you, Kip? How did a kaln find your pendant and then bring it all the way back here?*
