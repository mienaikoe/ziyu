## Chapter 16

Melna awoke in a dark corner of the great room with a sliver of Ara peering through the windows. For a moment she found herself in that space between dream and reality, imagining Liffa at the front door watching hae garden in the light while Kipnu lay beside her, still sound asleep. The ghosts of tall grasses chirped in her mind. A million thirsty mouths quenched by countless tiny droplets dancing to and fro, dampening the noise of their goings and doings. But something was amiss in her dreams as well: a chill in the air, a dim in the light, a small annoying twist in her tunic. She sat up with Kipnu beside her and looked toward Liffa at the door, looking back at the two of them with tears in hae eyes.

"Kipnu... Melna... I love you." Thi turned and left, shutting the door behind hae.

"Where are you going?" She called to hae, but thi had gone and the room was empty. She sat up and looked toward the door, still closed, and found herself on the floor near the washroom, dressed in an overly wrinkled version of the clothes she wore the day before. _Why am I on the floor?_

"Linyu?" She called loudly, suddenly remembering hae. "Linyu?!"

She lifted herself up by one arm and scurried around the house looking for where Linyu might have gone. Liffa's robes had been left in the washroom and there was no other sign of Linyu.

With little time to spare that day, she resolved to carry on with her day and have Thimlu, the operator, send a message to look for hae. Pomri would give her an earful on the whole journey if she was late for her own appointment. She quickly grabbed her senate robes from the bedroom and filled a copper canteen of water, stuffing them in her bag, and walked outside into the foggy morning.

She approached the stable, calling, "Laen-Laen," but she heard nothing. She checked the stable and Laen-Laen was gone.

She panicked and called again, louder and further than before, "Laen-Laen!"

There was no answer, but from a distance she spotted the figure of a saffa lying underneath Liffa's ziyu tree. She ran toward it calling for Laen-Laen once again, and he made three short whoops to wake up.

"Why are you all the way out here, Linyu?" She asked him. Linyu was curled up between Laen's stretching legs, beginning to awaken. The wooden listener was still on hae ear.

"Linyu," she hastened.

Thi started to talk but remembered the pain in hae throat as only a whisper emerged. Thi cleared it gently and tried again.

"Tree," thi said with only the scratch of a voice, holding haeself up against the ground.

"I was so worried where you had gone."

"Why?" thi asked, and surprised her.

"Because you're... alone. And I have no clue where your parents are and you can't call for help."

"Am. Fine," thi said with conviction. Melna's preplexion was renewed. Such an independent child could surely not have come from Heiko. _But then how did thi get here?_, she thought.

"Well, anyway, I need to take Laen on a big trip to Shaki today."

"Sha. Ki?"

"Yes. It's quite far and there are a few things I must attend to there, so I might not be back for a while. I know someone in the city who can look after you while I'm gone."

"With. You," thi said.

"You want to go with me?"

Thi nodded earnestly in boundless appreciation of the clarity of a plan and a person to trust, but Linyu had no way to tell her and Melna would never have understood.

"No. It's much too dangerous. It's better if you stay here with Thimlu at the observatory."

Thi stood up now and approached her. "With. You," thi insisted.

She didn't have the time to argue, and thought it might be good to understand more about this mysterious child with a listening device. She stooped to hae height and placed her hands on hae shoulders.

"I don't know how much you remember or know about the world right now, but I need you to understand something if you're going to be traveling with me. I am a fidelant from Heiko. Do you know what a fidelant is?"

Thi furrowed hae brow, and Melna was surprised.

"I go to a big room where all the provinces of the world discuss things, and I represent the people who live here. In that room, a few days ago, I was accused of hoarding food, and I had to give away some of my province's food. A lot of people aren't happy about that, so we must keep a low profile to avoid danger. That means we have to stick together and stay out of trouble. You understand?"

Thi nodded back.

"Good. Now we don't have much time so let's eat up to prepare. Just follow wherever Laen goes and you'll be safe," she told hae. She ambled across the path and down a shallow slope toward the garden to fetch whatever vegetables might be waiting there, the saffa in toe with Linyu's hand glued tight to his rib.

"You like those, right Laen?" Melna asked him, pointing at the vast plot of pohua. He sniffed the stems, hungry but patient.

"Let's find you a couple big ones..."

She entered a row at a low point in the field and dug at the root of one plant.

"This one seems pretty healthy even in the cold," she said to herself.

The girthy root began to taper in the soil, and she pulled easily on the stems to liberate it from the ground. She hadn't worked the soil since her childhood, as her stance and dress might suggest, but a fidelant was always ready for anything, including the care of her saffa. A few more and and she stored them in her bag for later, leaving two in her hands for now.

She handed them to Linyu and said, "Here, feed these to Laen-Laen."

Thi held them out one at a time and a gentle mouth lifted them from hae hands and chomped down, splashing droplets of a sweet yellow liquid all over. The sweet aroma of fresh pohua and not-so-fresh saffa breath filled their noses.

Melna took this time to find something that she and Linyu could eat, but everything else had seemed to be wilting under the low-light. With each row she checked, her panic mounted. She wondered how many people had moved their plots closer to Ara or faced the same problems.

"Our grain stores are practically empty from ration sharing," she tol a disappointe Linyu. "I guess we'll have to get something to eat in town. The quicker we ride out there, the quicker we get to eat."

She led them to the stable where she fetched a thick linen riding cloth and wrapped it securely around Laen-Lean's back and chest. Once he had finished with his breakfast, he hummed in satisfaction as he sniffed around for scraps that might have fallen between his teeth.

"Here," she said to Linyu, stooping to fetch a small but durable travel bag. "Keep this with you. It's made of mycose, so it's waterproof and keeps its shape well. It's great for storing food."

With a firm grab of his neck hair, she hopped onto Laen's back and settled herself into the forward-leaning position, a little further back than she was used to.

"Come on," she said, holding her arms out to Linyu, "I'll pull you up."

And with a firm grip she lifted hae up to sit in front of her.

"Alright, Laen-Laen. To the station, but steady."

He started walking, still licking his teeth and clearly not focused on the path while Linyu got in some last bits of sleep and Melna focused her mind to the day ahead. Putting pressure on Holrag while they held ultimate power in the senate was a nearly impossible task, but it had to be done.

The station would have been quiet and empty, were it not for a couple of mechanics resting in the corner near the entrance and the old station attendant who found some solace in being there. The ground near the tracks had notices painted on, "No Trains â€“ Provincial Travel Lockdown", in big white lettering, barely visible through the fog-diffused light of Ara. The breath of Ulu loitered in the still air, a sign of an end to morning winds in Heiko.

She strained her eyes to look for Pomri in case she had been waiting elsewhere. The echoes of her voice bounced off of the walls, absent of any people to muffle them.

"Guess I'm not the only late one," she said to herself.

Laen-Laen stooped down, letting her gently off his back. She patted the saffa's cheek and turned to Linyu.

"Stay here, Linyu. I'll be right back."

She approached the station attendant wearing an impeccable posture in lieu of her robes.

She greeted him, "Hi there. Do you know if this is when the train typically arrives?"

He gave her a once-over and said, "No trains today. Get out of here."

"I'm just looking for the time," she persisted.

He looked behind her and quickly walked away, ending the conversation. The mechanics from the corner were approaching slowly with a swagger meant to intimidate: a young man in uniform who looked like he hadn't slept the night before and a maman about his height and build, twiddling with a steel bar fashioned with a crook at the end.

"You look familiar," thi said. Hae eyes shot toward Melna's bag where her hastily-packed robes were peeking out.

"You're the one who gave away all our food."

Melna suddenly felt her muscles tighten and she glanced back at Laen-Laen who wasn't paying attention to them.

"Wonder if you kept any for yourself," thi said, and thi lunged for her bag. Melna just barely pulled it away from hae fingers, but as she turned to run she felt the cold touch of a steel bar across her throat. She tried to turn around, but the man held his arm against her shoulder to keep her down.

"I have no food," she pleaded, "Only robes and water."

"Your saffa will do", the man said, looking at Laen-Laen. "Call it over."

"You would kill a saffa to eat?"

"We don't have the luxury of choice. You took that from us," he said in his most scornful tone. It was clear he had been waiting for this moment to take his revenge.

Melna looked over to Laen-Laen who was too busy licking his legs to know what was happening. She held a moment for thought, and then raised her hand to her ear and made a peculiar humming sound. Laen-Laen looked over to her for a moment and then slowly started walking toward them, looking cautiously in every direction.

"Hurry it up!" The maman demanded with the bar still at Melna's neck. Melna made the sound again, and Laen-Laen continued, ever more cautious. Before he reached her, Laen-Laen became suddenly happy about something nearby.

A voice called from behind them, "Melna. glad I found you."

The pair turned around to find Pomri, on her own saffa, holding a polished blue titanium sword to the man's neck.

"Looks like you've made some friends," she addressed Melna.

The maman tugged on the man's arm and they dashed away from the station as fast as they could.

"You're woefully unprepared," said Pomri, sheathing her swordd.

Melna was stoic. "Those two need guidance not threats, Pomri. Their lives are already filled with fear."

Pomri suspended her disagreement and aimed her tongue elsewhere. "Who's this kaln?" she asked, giving the slightest glance to Linyu, "And what's with hae eyes?"

"This is Linyu."

Pomri patiently waited for more details.

Melna started again, "I found hae with Laen-Laen, voiceless and blind. Now they're pretty much inseparable. I don't know where thi came from, or how thi got into such a state."

"And you're taking this kid with us to Shaki? Isn't there someone here to take care of hae?"

"I think thi might know some things that we don't know."

Pomri wore a blank stare in an attempt to hide her frustration.

"You never run out of strange ideas, do you?" she asked in an antagonizing tone.

Melna let out an exasperated sigh. "My ways may seem strange to you, Pomri, but I am desparate for answers. I'm doing this for the assurance that we tried everything that we could."

"I only hope that we don't run out of time," she rebuked.

"Time... Never been fond of it. A little more, and we'd use it to complain about how little we had."

"Oiii. Sometimes I wonder how you became a fidelant with such terrible quips."

"There are no bad jokes, Pomri. Only bad people."

"Are you done?"

---

The seldom-seen path along the rail line was littered with withered leaves and stems. Several Ka'To had passed since the line had been laid by the railmakers of Holrag and it showed in these old paths of sand and gravel that had been abandoned soon after the rail was built.

Pomri took out her canteen and gulped a mouthful of water before looking over to Linyu.

"You thirsty, Linyu? Boon-Boon filled up on plenty so she won't be needing much."

Thi didn't answer, but wore a scowl of distrust.

Pomri's hand receded and twisted the vessel closed. "Oh, my water's not good enough for you? Your pride will be your death," she said.

"Oh Pomri, thi's a lost kid. Don't take it personally."

"Lost or not, a gift from a Rudjani is not to be refused."

Linyu's gaze of hearing had already diverted back toward the road.

A soft hand rested on hae shoulder, and thi snapped out of hae thoughts, "Hey, you ok?"

Thi straightened hae back and let out a gentle sigh, bringing a hand to meet hers.

Melna told hae, "Pomri can be a bit difficult at times-"

"-If by difficult you mean honest"

"...But she means well. And there's some truth in her words. We're not quite halfway to Rudjan, and Shaki is still further. We all need to keep hydrated out here."

She extended her own canteen to hae, and thi begrudgingly took a sip, a pause, and then another before giving it back to Melna.

"Laen," thi whispered hae concern to her.

"Saffas drink a lot of water and hold it for much longer. We'll give him some once we reach Rudjan."

Thi leaned forward into his thick fur and held close to his back. Melna briefly let her curiosity wander back to the listener on hae ear; the things she heard, and the things she might be missing.

"Linyu," she began to ask. Thi turned hae head along Laen's back to show thi was listening. The polished surface and patterns in the grain of the listener shone clearer now in the brighter light. She remembered how attached thi was to it, that it symbolized hae mother. There were so many questions she had to ask, and so few ways to ask them.

"It's.. It's nothing. Never mind," she said.

Linyu relaxed again while Melna kept looking toward Rudjan, troubled by a question she didn't know how to ask.

_When we stop. I need to know._

---

Pomri was glowing at the first sight of her hometown. The pale orange of Ara splashed its light upon the patchwork of grasses and lakes dotting the wetlands, above which stretched a long wooden causeway proudly laying the path into the city. It was rare that she would be introducing the city to someone, much less a child, so she was filled with excitement.

"Linyu, do you know much about Rudjan?"

Linyu looked in her direction with a vacant face, annoyed that she was talking again.

"Home," thi said.

"Yes, it is my home! Allow me to introduce you to Rudjan, the city of ships!"

She waved her hands as if channeling some sort of illusion in the air.

"Rudjan is a fortress of a city-state on the border of Shaki and Heiko provinces. The settlers found this giant wetland and realized that it would be safe from invaders."

"It wasn't very safe from saffas," Melna butted in.

Pomri shot her a glare, and continued teaching.

"The saffas and tilmarims that inhabited the area did not take kindly to their new neighbors, and almost destroyed the settlement completely. But through ingenuity, we found a way to communicate at a basic level with the animals and bargained with them to live in peace."

"The settlers tricked them into fighting each other," said Melna.

"Goodness, woman, let me tell the story!"

"You're fogging up the water."

"How would you know this story anyway?"

"I hear it everytime I come here with you."

"Good. Then let Linyu hear it too."

Melna kept her face forward with a slight smirk and gestured to Pomri to continue.

"Anyway, after much bargaining we came to a mutual agreement. The stone walls of Rudjan were built to keep saffas and tilmarim out and people in, and we would no longer form trade routes on their wetlands."

"The people were afraid."

"Melna!"

She snickered under her breath so only Linyu could hear.

"Anyway, now that you know about our history, let me tell you about the bridge we're crossing."

Linyu leaned back and looked up at Melna as if to say, "Do I have to?", to which Melna laughed in surprise.

"By Ara, I haven't heard you chuckle once since the Obscura showed up. Some kaln comes along and now you're as bright as glass in the desert."

She looked down at hae and pondered at the mysteries behind this peculiar child dressed in kelp clothing that life had swept her way.

"Linyu reminds me to stay patient. Whatever this kaln went through to be alone in the cold in a foreign province, thi adapted through it all and found others to trust. We should all be so resilient."

They came to the edge of the wetland, and dismounted from their saffas. Before them, a city awaited their arrival, a train awaited their board. But for now the saffas wooped and played in the water of their ancestors, the throngia looked on in glee, and not one among them in this moment of respite felt any worry for the state of their world.

<!--

Ramne + Penyi + Ginnu?
or Ramne + Ginnu?

Do this reveal when meeting and running from Ramne
  Maybe Ginnu has the pendant, and gives it to Linyu to try and tell hae that Kipnu is alive.
  Ramne is angry at this and causes a ruckus to try and get the pendant back while Melna runs
    away with Linyu. Pomri tries to stop him, and gets a mild gash in the process.



She changed the subject in attempt to build trust, "Here. Let me show you something."

She reached under her shirt to reveal her family pendant. Silver, and slightly worn from use.

"Have you seen one of these before? It's a pendant that my nather made for me. We keep track of our family trees with tiny engravings on the inside."

Slowly, she removed it from her neck and held it out to Linyu, who was still staring into the distance.

"Want to see it?"

Linyu was confused but took a look anyway. Melna watched as thi looked intently at the engravings. Suddenly, thi reached into hae shirt and pulled out a pendant of hae own and began to compare the two. Melna was shocked to see Kipnu's pendant in the hands of this strange kaln.

"Where did you get that?!" She asked, grasping to see Kipnu's pendant

Linyu quickly finished checking the two and hae eyes started to water. Without a moment's pause, thi flung haeself at Melna and made whimpering breaths into her shoulder.

"Kipnu," thi whispered through tears. She let hae cry a bit more but her mind kept racing back and forth to all of the possibilities that could have led to this moment.
