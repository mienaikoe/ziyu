I wished my old tree good morning as I rustled my way through its branches and set my back down on the slope that its trunk had been building. The sunlight had just begun to lift the dewdrops, slowly making room for the songleaves around them to transform the new morning breeze into the music of the spirits.

You cannot hear the first note of a jiyu's song. There is no grand entrance or catchy hook. It's more like a choir of thousands of distant voices all entering and exiting at different times with their pre-ordained notes. When you start to hear the song, you realize that it's been singing for a while, only your mind was not clear enough to focus on it. No mind has been or will ever be clear enough to know which of a jiyu's leaves sang first. Only the tree can know, and it will forever keep it secret.

It was under this tree that I was born. Among the plants and animates that called this magnificent tree home, I made my first cry to the heavens and the heavens sang back through the leaves. My mother used to tell me it was the most beautiful thing watching me be born. They had been waiting all night for me to start, but I wouldn't budge until just before dawn. It had been raining that night and the leaves of the tree were glistening by the crescent of green light of our sibling planet, Surien. She told me that the song the tree sang that morning had never sounded quite so much like a lullaby, carrying me in its arms the way she would do. I still imagine it sometimes when I come here, laying in her arms at dawnlight, hidden within the greatest sound in all the world.

I recited my mother's poem quietly:
  *The jiyu is an orchestra.*
  *The sunlight tunes its reeds.*
  *The rain decides each note and rest*
  *and breath flies in the breeze*

  *My ears are not the ending points;*
  *the song lives on within me.*
  *I speak with it upon my lips*
  *and with my hands it guides me*

  "Lovely poem"
  Startled, I turned around to see Melna sitting behind me with her legs tucked under her, smiling her warm smile.
  "How long have you been hovering over there?"
  "Only a little bit. I knew you'd be out here just like you do every morning after a rain, so I thought I'd come out to get you for breakfast and catch a bit of the song"
  I turned forward again and listened for the last notes.
  "What did you think of the poem," I asked.
  "It was"
