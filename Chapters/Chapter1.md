I wished my old tree good morning as I rustled my way through its branches and set my back down on the slope that its trunk had been building. The sunlight had just begun to lift the dewdrops, slowly making room for the songleaves around them to transform the new morning breeze into the music of the spirits.

You cannot hear the first note of a jiyu's song. There is no grand entrance or catchy hook. It's more like a choir of thousands of distant voices all entering and exiting at different times with their pre-ordained notes. When you start to hear the song, you realize that it's been singing for a while, only your mind was not clear enough to focus on it. No mind has been or will ever be clear enough to know which of a jiyu's leaves sang first. Only the tree can know, and it will forever keep it secret.

It was under this tree that I was born. Among the plants and animates that called this magnificent tree home, I made my first cry to the heavens and the heavens sang back through the leaves. My mother used to tell me it was the most beautiful thing watching me be born. They had been waiting all night for me to start, but I wouldn't budge until just before dawn. It had been raining that night and the leaves of the tree were glistening by the crescent of green light of our sibling planet, Surien. She told me that the song the tree sang that morning had never sounded quite so much like a lullaby, carrying me in its arms the way she would do. I still imagine it sometimes when I come here, laying in her arms at dawnlight, hidden within the greatest sound in all the world.

I recited my mother's poem quietly:
  *The jiyu is an orchestra.*
  *The sunlight tunes its reeds.*
  *The rain decides each note and rest*
  *and breath flies in the breeze*

  *My ears are not the ending points;*
  *the song lives on within me.*
  *I speak with it upon my lips*
  *and with my hands it guides me*

"Lovely poem"
Startled, I turned around to see Melna sitting behind me with her legs tucked under her, smiling her warm smile.
"How long have you been hovering over there?"
"Only a little bit. I knew you'd be out here just like you do every morning after a rain, so I thought I'd come out to get you for breakfast and catch a bit of the song"
I turned forward again and listened for the last notes.
"What did you think of the poem," I asked.
"It was"

Kip sat at the kitchen table reading a postletter with his morning face on. His hair, the furrowed nest of a bird with all the wrong branches. Our tired eyes met and he put on his best goofy smile: a typical greeting for him and me. Mel was too busy to be amused by our nonsense but she usually didn't partake anyway.

   "Who's the letter from?", I asked casually.

   "My parents. They're on vacation on the east coast this week."

   "Ooh. Quite hot this time of year," said Melna. Her eyes turned down to pick up the porridge bowls she had prepared before fetching me.

   "Yea. They've always been ones to go on adventures to exotic places. This probably isn't the hottest they've experienced."

   "Quite brave," said Mel, setting down our breakfast. She turned back to get her own. "So why the East in particular?" 

    "Well they haven't gone in a while and they were really wanting to see a good view of the great crown at sunrise."
   I was immediately excited. "Oh, I've heard about that. They say there's very little fog or cloud on the east coast and that the sky is so clear you can see the outlines of the crown's plates where the light hits."

   "Huh. Sounds great. We should see it someday," he said in a ho-hum sort of way. Kip had turned his attention toward breakfast, his happy place.

   Mel sat in her seat and began to tap on the table as if something was missing. 

   "Lif, where did you leave the water jug?"

   I responded politely, "I don't know, I haven't touched it since dinner last night."

   "...Kip?"

   He looked up from his breakfast and pointed his nose toward the reading room.

   "On the table."

   Mel waited to see if he would get up, but he turned back to his breakfast. Sensing her irritation, I started to rise but she paused me with a firm grip on my arm and some sort of repeated syllable that signified she was proving a point and I should not get in her way.

   "Kip."

   "Mmmmhm?" He was pretty oblivious.

   "Could you fetch it for us?"

   "Oh. Yea, sure."

   He got up and paced toward the water jug while Mel lowered her head toward her again, a discontented sound echoing from her throat.
   
   A pause of quiet slurping went by and I could see Mel's mind had moved onto a deeper thought. She withdrew her hand from her spoon and sat up in her chair, breathing a closed-eye sigh of longing into the morning sunlight. I could tell she was thinking about travling again. We had been entwined too early before we could roam across Palinan as single Palinians do.
   "Thinking about going to the East Coast yourself?" I chimed.
   "I am. It's been too long since we've gone anywhere."
   Kip, hesitant, joined, "Last time was when we went to the North coast to live with the halpas for a week. I'll never forget how cold that was."
   Mel immediately recalled the memory, "Ughhh. Don't remind me. Halpas are a great people, but I will never understand why they live in the tundra."
   
   
   ********

   After breakfast, Kip cleaned up while Mel and I moved upstairs to the dressing room to prepare for the day. Her and I started this morning ritual when we first started living together as a quiet time to bond. We chose what to wear together and I would watch her and playfully try to slow her down. After doing this everyday for years, we had a way of knowing what each other is thinking so we stopped using words. Sometimes we would have whole conversations with just our eyes and our hands. I've found that it's better to tell her she's beautiful without saying it.

Mel had always spent her day in the capital while Kip and I stayed home to farm our own food and maintain the house. 
Her eyes flutter the feathers on the wings of my heart. Her presence teaches my spirit to fly and it learns like it's always known.
