  "Lovely day"

  Startled, I sat up to see a silhouette of Melna standing in the light, her hair dancing in time with the leaves.

  "How long have you been here?" I asked.

  "Just a click. I figured you would be here today."

  I stayed silent, still listening for the leaves and my mother's voice.

  "You've been gone a while. Your breakfast is cold."

  "I'll be there in a bit."

  She stared at me for a moment - I assume to size up my strange behavior, and then turned to walk back home.

  She reassured me, "I feel it too. There's a chill in the air."

  I felt no comfort.

  Kip was at the stove reheating my breakfast and reading a postletter with his morning face on. His hair, the furrowed nest of a bird that took a liking to crooked branches. He looked up, locking his tired eyes to mine, and put on his goofiest morning smile which only complimented his hair. I walked up to nuzzle him. Melna was squatting at the eating table, reading her daily missive from the provincial council.

  "Who's the letter from?", I asked Kip casually.

  "My parents. They're on vacation to the east bay this week."

  "That's a strange place to vacation," said Melna.

  "Yea. They've always been ones to go on adventures to exotic places. They were really wanting to see the sky when Ara is high. Something about brightness meditation."

  I was immediately excited. "Oh, I've heard about that. They say there are no clouds or fog and the whole sky is bright blue like the sunrise. You can see some features of the crown too."

  "And I bet it's hot enough to pass out too," he remarked, still not convinced.

  "That sounds awful," said Mel, her eyes still focused her work, "Why would someone choose that place to meditate in?"

  Kip shrugged and let out a hopeless hum, more focused on the letter than the now boiling soup pot. I came closer and nudged him away to remove the pot from the focus while he took a moment to snap out of reading.

  "A bowl would be great," I told him.

  "Ah yea. A bowl," he fetched one and held it out for me to pour into.

  Mel walked over to us to check on the food. "Let me make sure it's still like my Amma used to make," she took out a spoon and dipped it into the bowl. "It's too thick and too hot - add some water"

  I did as she said and finally sat down to eat.

  A moment of quiet slurping went by and I could see Mel's mind had moved onto a deeper thought. She released her pen and sat up in her chair, staring longingly out into the sunrise. I could tell she was thinking about traveling again. The three of us had joined too early before we could roam across the world.

  "Thinking about traveling?" I chimed at her.

  "I am. It's been too long since we've gone anywhere."

  Kip joined, "Last time was when we went to the North coast to live with the Hunnin for a week. I'll never forget how cold that was. Who's idea was that again?" He never missed a chance to remind me.

  "Hey, we all had fun uh... catching fish," I defended myself.

  "You mean having sex," Mel interjected.

  I defended my position, "Hey, catching fish was fun too."

  "There was literally nothing else to do," Kip reminded me.

  "Yea... but I'd totally do it again!"

  And I would. I was kind of a sucker for them. He and Mel shook heads and laughed while I broke the smarmiest smile.

  "Hey... what did you mean this morning?" I asked Melna as she got dressed for the day. "You mentioned you could feel a chill."

  She responded, "Oh nothing. Just an observation."

  I could hear the lie. Why would she lie?

  "If there's something you know-"

  "-I wouldn't be able to tell you anyway."

  She moved to the mirror and I followed her. The newly-awoken daylight had been shining through the window, and it bounced off the mirror and into my eyes as I walked toward it. I put my arm up to shield the light, as it missed her completely. She proceeded to wrap and tighten the clay-orange cords of a Heiko senator around her robe.

  "The farmers... we have a responsibility, you know. If a wind current drift is happening, we need to know so we aren't caught by an early-"

  "Lif... I've already told you all I that I know. I will learn more when I attend today's convention."

  She was a stone wall of secrets. I was unsatisfied, but it was unfair of me to keep pushing on it when I knew she was bound to her duties. I wasn't letting her go without a promise.

  I placed a hand on her bare shoulder, and pleaded, "Look me in the eye. Look at me and tell me you are not keeping secrets from your village. From your family."

  She looked at me through the mirror for a moment, searching for motives in a face of none.

  "You will know soon," she said coldly.

  I let out a frustrated sigh and made my way to the doorway of her room.

  "Lif..."

  I stopped.

  "Don't tell Kip about this."

  I continued.

  Kip was going over his schedule of patients in the same spot we had left him. He looked up and took a glance at me, burying his head in the schedule again.

  "Mel got you down?"

  "How could you tell?"

  "Ah you know."

  I waited for him to elaborate.

  "...Reasons."

  Thanks Kip.

  I mustered up a response, "Don't want to talk about it right now."

  He wasn't convinced, but he was more accepting about these things than I was.

  "Okay... suit yourself"

  I stooped at the table with him and a long awkward silence filled the room while I watched him write notes in his schedule. Mel came downstairs and looked us over. She had a confused look for a brief moment, but resumed her recessional.

  "I'm headed to the train."

  "Have a good day," he chimed. I stayed silent.

  "I'll be back a bit late tonight. Don't wait up for me on dinner."

  "Late? What for?" I asked.

  "I was promised a busy day today."

  I looked in her eyes more intently. Something about her eyes was very out of place. As if she had shut off her heart and it was wallowing in guilt. I stood up and approached her as she turned to leave the house.

  "What are you doing?" She asked. I checked that her cords were tight and robe was creased correctly.

  "Whatever it is you'll be arguing today, I am here for you."

  I embraced her as if she was going on a long journey. She was never too fond of touch, but today she raised her arms to reciprocate.

  "Thank you. Lif."

  Kip walked up to us, and she loosened up to nuzzle both of us quickly before opening the door to the outside. Kip and I watched as she entered the daylight and headed toward the rail station without looking back.

  "What's eating her?" Kip asked again.

  "Nothing. Just a chill in the air."
