  "Lovely song"

  Startled, I turned around to see Melna sitting behind me with her legs tucked under her, smiling her warm smile.

  "How long have you been hovering over there?"

  "Only a little bit. I knew you'd be out here just like you do every morning after a rain, so I thought I'd come out to get you for breakfast and catch a bit of the song"

  I turned forward again and listened for the last notes.

  "What did you think of the song," I asked.

  She paused for a bit to think, and then answered, "Like the Jiyu's song, its beauty does not expire."

  Kip sat at the kitchen table reading a postletter with his morning face on. His hair, the furrowed nest of a bird with all the wrong branches. Our tired eyes met and he put on his best goofy smile: a typical greeting for him and me. Mel was too busy to be amused by our nonsense but she usually didn't partake anyway.

   "Who's the letter from?", I asked casually.

   "My parents. They're on vacation on the east coast this week."

   "Ooh. Quite hot this time of year," said Melna. Her eyes turned down to pick up the porridge bowls she had prepared before fetching me.

   "Yea. They've always been ones to go on adventures to exotic places. This probably isn't the hottest they've experienced."

   "Quite brave," said Mel, setting down our breakfast. She turned back to get her own. "So why the East in particular?"

   "Well they haven't gone in a while and they were really wanting to see a good view of the great crown at sunrise."

   I was immediately excited. "Oh, I've heard about that. They say there's very little fog or cloud on the east coast and that the sky is so clear you can see the outlines of the crown's plates where the light hits."

   "Huh. Sounds great. We should see it someday," he said in a ho-hum sort of way. Kip had turned his attention toward breakfast, his happy place.

   Mel sat in her seat and began to tap on the table as if something was missing.

   "Lif, where did you leave the water jug?"

   I responded politely, "I don't know, I haven't touched it since dinner last night."

   "...Kip?"

   He looked up from his breakfast and pointed his nose toward the reading room.

   "On the table."

   Mel waited to see if he would get up, but he turned back to his breakfast. Sensing her irritation, I started to rise but she paused me with a firm grip on my arm and some sort of repeated syllable that signified she was proving a point and I should not get in her way.

   "Kip."

   "Mmmmhm?" He was pretty oblivious.

   "Could you fetch it for us?"

   "Oh. Yea, sure."

   He got up and paced toward the water jug while Mel lowered her head toward her again, a discontented sound echoing from her throat.

   A pause of quiet slurping went by and I could see Mel's mind had moved onto a deeper thought. She withdrew her hand from her spoon and sat up in her chair, breathing a closed-eye sigh of longing into the morning sunlight. I could tell she was thinking about travling again. We had been entwined too early before we could roam across Palinan as single Palinians do.
   "Thinking about going to the East Coast yourself?" I chimed.
   "I am. It's been too long since we've gone anywhere."
   Kip, hesitant, joined, "Last time was when we went to the North coast to live with the halpas for a week. I'll never forget how cold that was."
   Mel immediately recalled the memory, "Ughhh. Don't remind me. Halpas are a great people, but I will never understand why they live in the tundra."


   ********

   After breakfast, Kip cleaned up while Mel and I moved upstairs to the dressing room to prepare for the day. Her and I started this morning ritual when we first started living together as a quiet time to bond. We chose what to wear together and I would watch her and playfully try to slow her down. After doing this everyday for years, we had a way of knowing what each other is thinking so we stopped using words. Sometimes we would have whole conversations with just our eyes and our hands. I've found that it's better to tell her she's beautiful without saying it.


   *********

Mel had always spent her day in the capital while Kip and I stayed home to farm our own food and maintain the house.

   *********

Her eyes flutter the feathers on the wings of my heart. Her presence teaches my spirit to fly and it learns like it's always known.
