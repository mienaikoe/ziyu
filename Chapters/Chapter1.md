  "Lovely day"

  Startled, I sat up to see a silhouette of Melna standing in the light, her hair dancing in time with the leaves.

  "How long have you been here?" I asked.

  "Just a click. I figured you would be here today."

  I stayed silent, still listening for the leaves and my mother's voice.

  "You've been gone a while. Your breakfast is cold."

  "I'll be there in a bit."

  She stared at me for a moment - I assume to size up my strange behavior, and then turned to walk back home.

  She reassured me, "I feel it too. There's a chill in the air."

  I felt no comfort.

  Kip was at the sun stove reheating my breakfast and reading a postletter with his morning face on. His hair, the furrowed nest of a bird that had found all of the crooked branches. His tired eyes met mine and he put on his goofiest "it's my day off" smile. Melna was at the kitchen table, too busy planning her day to be amused by our nonsense.

  "Who's the letter from?", I asked him casually.

  "My parents. They're on vacation to the east bay this week."

  "That's a strange place to vacation," said Melna.

  "Yea. They've always been ones to go on adventures to exotic places. They were really wanting to see the sky when the star is high. Something about brightness meditation."

  I was immediately excited. "Oh, I've heard about that. They say there are no clouds or fog and the whole sky is bright blue like the sunrise. Everything is so hot that you sweat out all your worries."

  "That sounds awful," said Mel, her eyes still focused her work, "Why would someone choose that place to meditate in?"

  Kip shrugged and let out a hopeless hum, more focused on the letter than the now boiling soup pot. I came closer and nudged him away to remove the pot from the focus while he took a moment to snap out of reading.

  "A bowl would be great," I told him.

  "Ah yea. A bowl," he fetched one and held it out for me to pour into.

  Mel walked over to us to check on the food. "Let me make sure it's still like my Amma used to make," she took out a spoon and dipped it into the bowl. "It's too thick and too hot - add some water"

  I did as she said and finally sat down to eat.

  A moment of quiet slurping went by and I could see Mel's mind had moved onto a deeper thought. She released her pen and sat up in her chair, staring longingly out into the sunrise. I could tell she was thinking about traveling again. We had been married too early before we could roam across the world like most single Palinians.

  "Thinking about traveling?" I chimed at her.

  "I am. It's been too long since we've gone anywhere."

  Kip joined in, "Last time was when we went to the North coast to live with the Hunnin for a week. I'll never forget how cold that was. Who's idea was that again?" He never missed a chance to remind me.

  "Hey, we all had fun catching fish," I defended myself.

  "There was nothing else to do."

  "Yea... but it was fun!"

  He shook his head and laughed while Melna and I broke a smile.

  "Hey... what did you mean this morning?" I asked Melna as she got dressed for the day. "You mentioned you could feel a chill."

  "Oh nothing. Just an observation," A lie. Why would she lie?

  "If there's something you know-"

  "-I wouldn't be able to tell you anyway."

  She scurried to the mirror and I followed her.

  "So there *is* something."

  "I did not say that-"

  "Yes but you inferred it. Mel, us farmers... we are responsible for food here. If a seasonal drift is happening, we need to know that."

  "We know this already. The court will inform the people when the time is appropriate-"

  "And when will that be? When we start getting hit with frosts? When we've all starved to death? When will it be?"

  "Lif... you are beyond yourself. I've already told you all I can tell."

  I wasn't satisfied. She was never this secretive.

Mel had always spent her day in the capital while Kip and I stayed home to farm our own food and maintain the house.

   *********

Her eyes flutter the feathers on the wings of my heart. Her presence teaches my spirit to fly and it learns like it's always known.
