## Chapter 14


	Kip paused the group in their walk toward the Shadestead, smelling the first hints of fire in the air. He turned around and signaled to them to gather in close to him.

	"From this point on, Linyu and I will be guiding you from above, so I want to go over a few things. What you see and what we see may not be the same, so use your own judgment and decide what's best. Stay with your partners at all times; if one of them is hurt, confirm that the area is safe and get out. If they have a listener, take it off of them and put it on yourself. If any one of Lissa's guardians gets a hold of one we could all be captured, so do not let this happen. And finally, Do Not Kill; I repeat Do Not Kill unless they are endangering your life or your partner's life. Setre will be there and she cannot be harmed. Everyone clear?"

	"Yea," the said in a broken unison.

	"Voices off, everyone clear?"

	They nodded in a much clearer unison.

	"Stay here until you hear me through your listeners. I'll join you once the you begin. Good luck, everyone."

	He put his arm around Lin and said, "Lead the way." Lin took him through the forest, ever closer to the fire until they came upon an old tree that was leaning due to shifting clay in the ground.

	"This one," thi said, already starting to climb.

	Kip was concerned, "Is there a closer tree?"

	"This is the tree you start on. We can travel between trees once we get up above."

	He looked up into the dark abyss, and put his full trust in Linyu. Linyu and Kip tied a rope to each other, one to the transmitter, and another long one for rappeling back down, and began the climb up the tree. They were relying on the lean of the tree to support their weight with each vault to the next position. With such a large tree, Kip was struggling to wrap his legs in a way that would secure him, but he watched as Lin focused on scaling it with hae feet in the various crevasses that formed out of the bark.

	"Wait up, Linyu," he said, feeling a tug on the rope.

	"Sorry, Kipnu. I got carried away."

	Nearing the top, Kip could see branches, which served as nice places to rest, and the beginning of a canopy, with hints of Ara at the top.

	"Why is it so bright up here?"

	"These trees are so tall so their needles can reach Ara's light."

	"How do you mean?"

	"You'll see."

	When they reached an area with a lot of smaller branches, they could see clear rays of an infrared light dancing between the leaves. Lin led him along one of them so they could reach the end and peek their heads above the canopy. The light of Ara beamed straight into his eyes, and he had to shield them for a minute.

	"Why is it so bright up here?"

	"When you've been in the dark for so long, the light can seem painful."

	He finally opened his eyes, and was amazed at what he saw. Shaki Bay, with Ara in a gradient from dark to light. The Shaki Mountains, the Northern one of which the city was carved. And the lines of houses and farms, mere specks on the land that formed a geometric pattern as natural as Ara itself.

	"This is beautiful. I could never leave."
