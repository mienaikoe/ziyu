## Chapter 14


	Kip paused the group in their walk toward the Shadestead, smelling the first hints of fire in the air. He turned around and signaled to them to gather in close to him.

	"From this point on, Linyu and I will be guiding you from above, so I want to go over a few things. What you see and what we see may not be the same, so use your own judgment and decide what's best. Stay with your partners at all times; if one of them is hurt, make sure that the area is safe and get out. If they have a listener, take it off of them and put it on yourself. If any one of Lissa's guardians gets a hold of one we could all be captured, so do not let this happen. And finally, Do Not Kill; I repeat Do Not Kill unless they are endangering your life or your partner's life. Setre will be there and she cannot be harmed. Everyone clear?"

	"Yea," the said in a broken unison.

	"Voices off, everyone clear?"

	They nodded in a much clearer unison.

	"Stay here until you hear me through your listeners. I'll join you once the you begin. Good luck, everyone."

	He put his arm around Lin and said, "Lead the way." Lin took him through the forest, ever closer to the fire until they came upon an old tree that was leaning due to shifting clay in the ground.

	"This one," thi said, already starting to climb.

	Kip was concerned, "Is there a closer tree?"

	"This is the tree you start on. We can travel between trees once we get up above."

	He looked up into the dark abyss, and put his full trust in Linyu. They tied a rope to each other, one to the transmitter, and another long one for rappeling back down, and began the climb up the tree. They were relying on the lean of the tree to support their weight on each vault to the next position. With such a large tree, Kip was struggling to wrap his legs in a way that would secure him, but he watched as Linyu focused on scaling it with hae feet in the various crevasses that formed out of the bark.

	"Wait up, Linyu," he said, feeling an upward tug on the rope.

	"Sorry, Kipnu."

	Nearing the top, Kip could see branches, which served as nice places to rest, and the beginning of a canopy, with hints of Ara at the top.

	"Why is it so bright up here?"

	"These trees are so tall so their leaves can reach Ara's light."

	"How do you mean?"

	"You'll see."

	When they reached an area with several smaller branches, they could see clear rays of red light peering between the densely-packed thin leaves dancing with the wind above. Lin led him along one of them so they could reach the end and peek their heads above the canopy. The light of Ara beamed straight into his eyes, and he had to shield them for a moment.

	"Why is it so bright up here?"

	"When you've been in the dark for so long, the light can seem painful."

	He finally opened his eyes, and was amazed at what he saw. Shaki Bay, with Ara in a gradient from dark to light. The Shaki Mountains, the Northern one out of which the city was carved. And the lines of houses and farms, mere specks on the land that formed a geometric pattern as natural as Ara itself.

	"Absolutely beautiful," he said. Linyu remained quiet, remembering all the times hae mother brought hae there. Kip secured his footing and turned around to look toward Ulu. Through the darkness, Kip could see cloud cover for at least as far as he could see, which was only about the length of the island. But if he stared long enough, he could see tiny specks of faint red and infrared hanging in the sky.

  "Linyu, what are those red dots?" he asked, pointing toward the horizon.

  "Don't know. Mom calls them Ara's children. They're always right above the clouds when Ara is far away."

  "And they've always been there?"

  "Always."

  Kip was transfixed on them, wondering why he had never seen them on the mainland. but he snapped out of his temporary obsession, remembering that they still had a job to do.

  "Well, shall we move a bit closer?" He asked.

  "Can I ask you something first?"

  He hesitated, "Well, sure."

  "Once this ends, and you go back to your home on the mainland. Don't forget about us."

  Hae doubtful eyes peered into a part of himself he had long forgotten. As if Linyu was directing Kip's subconscious, and he himself was just a passenger.

  "I could never forget about you, Linyu. Or your mother, or your nather. I will find a way to clear Ara and I'll come back to tell you all the stories."

  "That's what every outsider says to the people they meet while they're here. They never come back."

  Kip felt a tear well up without surfacing. He wanted to say *I'm not whoever disappointed you. I mean the things that I say*. But instead he cracked a small smile to cover up his sadness and said, "No excuses, no mistakes. You have my word."

  But Linyu didn't smile; thi gathered hae things and climbed across the canopy, toward the clearing where the great fire burned brightly in the darkness below.

	They reached the base of a long thick branch that jutted its way into the opening, and Linyu found a coil wrapped around a smaller branch that grew out of it. Kip pulled up the battery and wrapped the slack rope in a simple knot around the smaller branch while Linyu twisted wires from the transmitter box to the coil ends. One-by-one, Linyu checked all of the connections and oriented the long face of the box toward the ground. Kip pulled a listener out of a satchel he was carrying and held it to his ear as an eager Linyu positioned haeself to speak into the transmitter.

	Thi spoke into the transmitter with anticipation, "If you can hear this, we're ready to go," and then laughed at Kip who had pulled it away from his ear because it was so loud.

	"It's louder, the closer you are," thi said.

	"Yea, I figured that out!" he exclaimed, putting the listener back into his satchel. The two looked over the big branch onto the Shadestead, making mental maps of the terrain and feeling the warm smoky currents from the fire mix with the wind. They counted seven blue lights from guardians scattered around the fire. Two of them were sparring with sticks near the kitchen and the others were eating a late dinner closer to the armory.

	Kip moved to the transmitter and said, "Seven guardians around the fire. Five near the armory. Approach from the East, everyone. Approach from the East."

	Linyu pointed to the south as the first signs of movement came from their group, moving in a line toward the Shadestead and shifting their movement to the East. *Setre's plan is working!*, he whispered.

	Their view of the armory was slightly obscured, but they watched as the group circled around it from the back.

	He noticed one of the eating guardians look to the side, and he quickly said, "Stop! Stop!" into the transmitter. They did, and the guardian went back to eating.

	"Walk slower and spread out," he said. And they watched as the group followed his orders. Once they reached the back side of the armory, Kip addressed the most agile maman in the group, "Penyi, go in and survey the place. The rest of you, sit tight and get your bearings." Kip kept his eyes on the guardians, watching every move and thinking of contingencies in case they did catch on. Moments stretched longer and longer until Kip began to feel uneasy about the time it was taking to search a tent so small.

	He asked Linyu, "What do you think is taking hae so long?"

	Thi shrugged and kept watching the scene, but Kip was getting impatient.

	"I'm going down there"

	"But I need you up here," thi said.

	"You'll be fine. It's just calling out things you see."

	"But-"

	He unwrapped the rope from Linyu and looped it around the first branch

	"I'll be right back," he said.

	"Kip!"

	But he was off, heading down the tree before thi could stop him.

	Back on the ground, Kip took the rope off and followed the pathway the group had taken as quickly and quietly as they had. Nearing the group, he saw their listeners and remembered to put his own on.

  "Hey, what's going on?" he asked them at a whisper.

  A maman told him, "Not sure. Penyi went in, then... nothing."

  "I'm going in. Someone come with me to be a messenger in case something goes wrong."

  "I'll go," whispered a woman. She came forward on all fours to quiet her movements, introducing herself, "I am Fanla, a tracker from Heiko."

  She was young, likely the kind who had come to Ulukoma on a whim. But fear was not apparent in her expressions - only excitement.

  "Ok Fanla. Follow a few paces behind me. If I get hit, you run, got it?"

  "Got it," She said.

  They tiptoed toward the armory tent, and Kip peeked underneath the cloth on the ground. He saw nothing but racks full of spears and a faint blue light from a bottle at the top of the tent. He slipped underneath with minimal effort and slowly stood up as he continued to look around. His ears listening for any sign of trouble from the fire or from Lin, he began surveying the tent a little closer than he had before. All was blue and still, with no sign of Penyi. *Thi didn't just vanish*. He took up a spear and with one last glance at the room, signaled under the wall for Fanla to come in.

  They both slowly walked around the room, looking at the weapons that were stockpiled - daggers, spears, swords, bows and arrows. All hardened and sharpened to an infinitesimal edge.

	"Hey, look at this," Fanla beckoned from another side of the tent.

	Kip shot a glance toward her feet where a small wooden door lay among the thin damp leaves. Its polished hardware was too precise to be made in Ulukoma, but its messy grease and handle reminded them of where they were.

	"Maybe this is where Penyi went," she said.

	"Maybe," he said, taking up two daggers and handing one to Penyi. Her hands took the dagger as she looked up with concern for Kipnu, but he could do nothing to quell it - he had to find Fanla. Kip kneeled down at the edge of the hole and with an imperceptible creak, he swung the door open to uncover a tunnel big enough for two leading into the darkness.

	"I'll go down," he said. "Start bringing people in one-by-one. If you hear any trouble, bring some people and come get me."

	"Got it," she said.

	With his hands against the wall, Kip made his way into the tunnel with only the blue light on his chest to light his way. After only a few steps, he came upon a sharp descent in the ground and he could no longer see a reflection of the blue light against anything in front of him. *A room. Dug into the ground like Shaki*, he thought. He sat down on the edge to try and feel for where the ground was in front of him, but he stopped when he heard the sound of footsteps on dust from far away in front of him. He covered his marking with his right arm and readied his dagger in the other while watching as the mysterious person came closer. They stopped immediately below him, several strides down and removed their shirt to reveal the bright blue markings of a guardian. The light bounced off of the ground and illuminated the face of Ramne, looking at a body lying on the floor in front of him.

	He murmured to himself, "Now who might you be?"

	He reached for an arm and picked the body up. It was a maman. *Penyi. You must have fallen.*. Once Ramne was far enough away, Kip put the dagger in his pouch and started his search for the ground again, slowly swinging his leg off the ledge. On the third swing, he broadened his swing, and his toe hit a steel peg, causing him to wince and fight every urge to scream. He took a moment to regain his calm and proceeded to move his hands to the peg. It was grooved in a peculiar way and the bottom was covered with a thick layer of rust, but after a few swipes he was sure he could get a solid grip on it. He started by slowly adding more of his weight on it until he was sure it would hold him. With a leap of faith, he jumped and let his feet fall below him while his hands were still fixed to the ends of the peg. To his surprise, his feet discovered another peg below him, upon which he found more secure footing and carefully stooped down to. He performed the same steps on the next peg and his feet found the ground - a desert of grit and dust. In the distance, he could still see the remnants of Ramne's blue light and the shadow of Penyi on his shoulder. *I can catch up*. He rubbed his toe to ease the pain and redistribute the water in his skin, and then took off after Ramne. With every silent step, the gap between them was closing, and the light of Ramne's chest grew brighter. The anticipation of a fight grew in him. *A man like that deserves what's coming to him*. When Kip had come within ten paces, Ramne stopped and turned in suspicion, but he was too late to fend off any sort of attack. Instead he threw Penyi at him and ran a few paces forward to keep the distance between him and his would-be assailant.

	"Who're you? How'd you get down here?"

	Kip dropped the dagger briefly to catch Penyi and lay hae down gently. As soon as thi was down, he reached for the dagger, but couldn't find it anywhere. Out of options, he turned to Ramne and took a defensive stance.

	"Kip? What are you doing here? You here for this milta?" he said, holding a hand to Penyi.

	Kip didn't respond, but held his stance and his look of disdain.

	"Oh I get it. You're the hero come to rescue the weak. When you gonna wake up, Kip? There are no heroes here. Just addicts. Selfish, miserable, fucked-up addicts. You can't save us."

	"No one can save you."

	He shouted, "Hah! Hahahaha. You think I'm any different than any of those shits in the tent? You think we're somehow wholesome people on the inside? You weren't here when Casra failed. When so many people took advantage of hae that thi was forced to move into the woods where no one could find hae. Ulukoma is a shit place. And us? We're all shit people. You get used to it or you die."

	"You'll regret this life someday. When the world revolves and purges your kind of evil. You'll be the one left in the dark."

	He laughed, "Oh I'm countin' on it."

	There was a tense pause which Kip broke, "So you gonna fight me or what?"

	"A colossal waste of time. You're not going anywhere with Penyi injured here."

	"Says who?"

	"Ask hae yourself."

	Penyi began to stir and moan, and Kip turned and ran to help hae.

	Ramne turned around and said, "time to play doctor, big hero. That's all your dreams good for."

	"Stay still, don't move anything," Kipnu told a barely-conscious Penyi. He could see bad scrapes and bruises on hae shoulder and a stream of blood coming from hae head. Kip glanced back at Ramne, but he had already faded into the infinite darkness of this underground cavity.

	"Ahhhh." Thi groaned in still-constant pain.

	"I know, Penyi. Where does it hurt?"

	"H-Headaahhh."

	"Head. Ok. I can work with that."

	He took off his pouch and gently raised hae head and shoulders much to Penyi's protest, and slipping the pouch underneath.

	"I'll be right back with something for the pain."

	"Unnhhhh!!" Thi exclaimed.

	He left hae there and ran back toward the pegs and the hole he came from.

	"Fanla, I need kanosin and something I can use as a stretcher."

	She was in the middle of passing out bows, but she came back to the hole and said, "What?!"

	"It's Penyi. Thi's in a lot of pain. Let's hurry."

	Without a beat, they both located some used Kanosin leaves and a sword rack that they wrapped with Kip's sturdy reed clothing. Kip showed her how to climb down the pegs and they both entered into the giant room of darkness with their makeshift stretcher
