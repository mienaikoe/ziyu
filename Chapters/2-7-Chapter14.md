## Chapter 14


	Kip paused the group in their walk toward the Shadestead, smelling the first hints of fire in the air. He turned around and signaled to them to gather in close to him.

	"From this point on, Linyu and I will be guiding you from above, so I want to go over a few things. What you see and what we see may not be the same, so use your own judgment and decide what's best. Stay with your partners at all times; if one of them is hurt, confirm that the area is safe and get out. If they have a listener, take it off of them and put it on yourself. If any one of Lissa's guardians gets a hold of one we could all be captured, so do not let this happen. And finally, Do Not Kill; I repeat Do Not Kill unless they are endangering your life or your partner's life. Setre will be there and she cannot be harmed. Everyone clear?"

	"Yea," the said in a broken unison.

	"Voices off, everyone clear?"

	They nodded in a much clearer unison.

	"Stay here until you hear me through your listeners. I'll join you once the you begin. Good luck, everyone."

	He put his arm around Lin and said, "Lead the way." Lin took him through the forest, ever closer to the fire until they came upon an old tree that was leaning due to shifting clay in the ground.

	"This one," thi said, already starting to climb.

	Kip was concerned, "Is there a closer tree?"

	"This is the tree you start on. We can travel between trees once we get up above."

	He looked up into the dark abyss, and put his full trust in Linyu. They tied a rope to each other, one to the transmitter, and another long one for rappeling back down, and began the climb up the tree. They were relying on the lean of the tree to support their weight on each vault to the next position. With such a large tree, Kip was struggling to wrap his legs in a way that would secure him, but he watched as Linyu focused on scaling it with hae feet in the various crevasses that formed out of the bark.

	"Wait up, Linyu," he said, feeling an upward tug on the rope.

	"Sorry, Kipnu."

	Nearing the top, Kip could see branches, which served as nice places to rest, and the beginning of a canopy, with hints of Ara at the top.

	"Why is it so bright up here?"

	"These trees are so tall so their needles can reach Ara's light."

	"How do you mean?"

	"You'll see."

	When they reached an area with several smaller branches, they could see clear rays of red light peering between the densely-packed thin leaves dancing with the wind. Lin led him along one of them so they could reach the end and peek their heads above the canopy. The light of Ara beamed straight into his eyes, and he had to shield them for a moment.

	"Why is it so bright up here?"

	"When you've been in the dark for so long, the light can seem painful."

	He finally opened his eyes, and was amazed at what he saw. Shaki Bay, with Ara in a gradient from dark to light. The Shaki Mountains, the Northern one out of which the city was carved. And the lines of houses and farms, mere specks on the land that formed a geometric pattern as natural as Ara itself.

	"Absolutely beautiful," he said. Linyu remained quiet, remembering all the times hae mother brought hae there. Kip secured his footing and turned around to look toward Ulu. Through the darkness, Kip could see cloud cover for at least as far as he could see, which was only about the length of the island. But if he stared long enough, he could see tiny specks of faint red and infrared hanging in the sky.

  "Linyu, what are those red dots?" he asked, pointing toward the horizon.

  "Don't know. Mom calls them Ara's children. They're always right above the clouds when Ara is far away."

  "And they've always been there?"

  "Always."

  Kip was transfixed on them, wondering why he had never seen them on the mainland. but he snapped out of his temporary obsession, remembering that they still had a job to do.

  "Well, shall we move a bit closer?" He asked.

  "Can I ask you something first?"

  He hesitated, "Well, sure."

  "Once this ends, and you go back to your home on the mainland. Don't forget about us."

  Hae doubtful eyes peered into a part of himself he had long forgotten. As if Linyu was directing Kip's subconscious, and he himself was just a passenger.

  "I could never forget about you, Linyu. Or your mother, or your nather. I will find a way to clear Ara and I'll come back to tell you all the stories."

  "That's what every outsider says to the people they meet while they're here. They never come back."

  Kip felt a tear well up without surfacing. He wanted to say *I'm not whoever disappointed you. I mean the things that I say*. But instead he cracked a small smile to cover up his sadness and said, "No excuses, no mistakes. You have my word."

  But Linyu didn't smile; thi gathered hae things and climbed across the canopy, toward the clearing where the great fire burned brightly in the darkness below.

	They reached the base of a long thick branch that jutted its way into the opening, and Linyu found a coil wrapped around a smaller branch that grew out of it. Kip pulled up the battery and wrapped the slack rope in a simple knot around the smaller branch while Linyu twisted wires from the transmitter box to the coil ends. One-by-one, Linyu checked all of the connections and oriented the long face of the box toward the ground. Kip pulled a listener out of a satchel he was carrying and held it to his ear as an eager Linyu positioned haeself to speak into the transmitter.

	Thi spoke into the transmitter with anticipation, "If you can hear this, we're ready to go," and then laughed at Kip who had pulled it away from his ear because it was so loud.

	"It's louder, the closer you are," thi said.

	"Yea, I figured that out!" he exclaimed, putting the listener back into his satchel. The two looked down onto the Shadestead, mapping the outlines of different sectors in their heads. They counted seven blue lights from guardians scattered around the fire. Two of them were sparring with sticks and the others were eating a late dinner closer to the armory. The faint raucous of the tent.

	feeling the mix of warm currents from the fire and the cold Ulu breeze above.
