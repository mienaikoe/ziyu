## Chapter 14

Kipnu stopped them at the top of the hill overlooking the pavilion, smelling the first hints of fire in the air. Ara was but a reddish sliver on the horizon, a view that he never fathomed to see. He turned around and signaled to them to gather in close. Huddled to his right was Fanla, who held the length of rope binding Ginnu's hands. It was an unpleasant position for the both of them, but she understood the weight of the job.

"From this point on, we'll split into the two groups I mentioned before. Stay with your partners at all times; if one of them is hurt, make sure that the area is safe and get the both of yourselves out of here. If they have a listener, take it off of them and put it on yourself. If you're about to be captured, destroy it. We cannot let them get a hold of one. And finally, we are not here to fight, we are here to liberate. Even if we have all of the weapons and antikan on Ulukoma, we wouldn't be able to defeat the guardians. Do not attack unless your life is in danger. Everyone clear?"

They made a gesture with their hands in assent, a sort of salute of honor that Kipnu had learned from Melna.

"Ground team, stay here until you hear us through your listeners. Sky team, let's move."

Kipnu took him through the forest, ever closer to the fire until they came upon a tree with a slight lean toward the pavilion. Its roots looked as sturdy as any other tree and its trunk was littered with a coil here and there, a sign that Linyu had often climbed it.

"This one," he whispered, looking up into the dark abyss, imagining Linyu there among its branches. He tied a rope to himself, leaving two long ends free, and began the climb up the tree. The lean helped to support their weight on each vault to the next position. With such a large tree, Kipnu was struggling to secure his footing on the bark, but he learned to find the various crevasses that formed out of the bark and use them to his advantage.

He came to a large branch and tossed one of the ropes at his back over the top of it, and a woman below took the other end in her hands. There was such a strong sense of safety in something so simple as a friendly hand end of a rope, he thought. He shook his hands to clear out any soreness and dry the water from his palms. There was another half to go.

A plethora of branches and rays of red light greeted him near the top, where he tossed the other rope over the thickest branch he could find and gave it a good shake to signal that he was ready. Now all he had to do was wait for the others to join him.

This place was bathed in the light of Ara, a sprawling terrain of densely-packed leaves and branches bobbing in the wind, spread across the horizon's curve like the earth itself had become an ocean. He had shield his eyes from the searing brightness to look in the direction of the mainland. In the distance to the north, he could make out the Shaki Mountains, and saw some lights from the hill where Yansha sat. A bit to the south was the Rudjan wetlands, lit brightly with the boat lanterns he'd heard about but never saw for himself. And all along the coast were lines of houses and farms and patches of trees, mere specks on the land that formed a geometric pattern as natural as Ara itself.

He turned around to look toward Ulu. Through the darkness, Kipnu could see patches of clouds that faded into Ulu. But if he stared long enough, he could see tiny specks of faint red and infrared hanging in the sky, ever still, ever bright. Like the small children of Ara. He wondered at what they might be, how long they'd been just beyond the veil of Ara.

Three people in total made it up the tree, shielding their eyes and gasping at the beauty of what they were seeing. They made their way from tree to tree atop the intertwined branches and toward the clearing that marked the fire and the pavilion. They came upon a larger tree at the perimeter of the clearing they'd been looking for and perched to look below, making mental maps of the terrain and feeling the warm smoky currents from the fire mix with the wind. They counted seven blue lights from guardians scattered around the fire. Two of them were sparring with sticks near the kitchen and the others were eating a late dinner closer to the armory.

Kipnu pulled a listener out of a satchel he was carrying and removed the coil assembly from the wooden puck. With a small tool he'd found in Casra's home, he cleaved a hole into the branch and inserted the end of the coil that stuck out, giving time for the fresh wet wood take to it. As they waited, they watched as the last sliver of light extinguished itself into the ground, and an eerie feeling overcame them. They knew that this strange new kind of darkness would soon be everywhere.

A maman, Penyi, produced a listener of hae own and asked for Kipnu to say something into the newly fastened coil.

"The wind speaks," he said with tone of conviction: the sort that Casra spoke with. He'd hoped that Setre was listening.

The maman with the listener nodded to him and he smiled, knowing Linyu's work hadn't gone to waste. He made a departing gesture to the three and made his way back across the branches and down the leaning tree, all the while wondering about in those strange red dots in the sky, and Linyu's strange blue eyes in the deep.

"Seven guardians around the fire," he told the ground team. "Five near the armory. We'll approach from Ulu-side."

And without a moment to pause, he led them in a sparse line through the forest, around the pavilion grounds and further into the dark.

Penyi's voice chimed in through the listener. "There's a commotion in the pavilion," thi said, "The guardians are leaving the armory."

"Now's our chance," he told them. "I need four volunteers to come with me. Walk silently and spread out."

He didn't stop to choose but began walking right as he'd given the order. He knew that time was short.

They reached the back side of the armory tent and Kipnu switched to gestures: a hand from his chest to the underside of the tent, then onto the ground in a waving motion. The four rose their hands in confirmation and he went down into the dirt, underneath the cloth, and arose in a makeshift room lit only by the fire from the far side. He firmly grasped his stolen spear and looked for signs of movement, but saw only racks upon racks of spears and daggers and huge fishing nets with metal weights, All of them hardened and polished to a mirror finish.

"Three guardians running toward the armory," said Penyi, and Kinpu suddenly found himself in the middle of the tent, looking for a place to hide. He considered running back toward the place he came in, but knew that if they spotted him, they would be led to the others. There was no option but to stay far away, taking cover behind racks and move with them.

"Those damned traitors," said a woman as she entered.

A man's voice followed hers, "We need fifty, maybe sixty. Fetch fifteen, each of you. I'll handle the rest."

_Ramne. Of course he's leading the counter-resistance._

Kipnu's eyes were trained upon the three figures, watching every move, thinking of contingencies in case they noticed him there in the corner. But for now, they were focused on their work.

"You done yet?" said Ramne, impatiently piling spears into their already-full arms. Ramne's lackies had cleared the racks near their side of the armory, and ran off on their way to fight Setre's force, leaving Ramne alone with him.

_I could dispatch Ramne now. Just a dagger in the back_, he thought, _wipe that smugness clean off his face_.

Kipnu took a dagger carefully from the stand in front of him, and held it snugly in his hands, imagined getting close enough to land a solid blow in one quick motion. But Ramne had other plans. He paced the racks up and down, with Kipnu moving between the racks discreetly to stay out of his line of sight.

"Ahh," he whispered to himself atop a conspicuously placed carpet. "Just what I was looking for."

He tossed aside the carpet and revealed a small wooden door among the thin damp leaves that had meandered there. Its polished hinges and edge moulding were too precise to be made in Ulukoma – closer to Shaki design – but the hinges were covered in a thick grease, as if whoever had placed it there wanted to be the only person using it. With a small jump Ramne fell into the hole, landing squarely upon a stone floor below. _What's he want antikan for?_ Kipnu wondered, and he slowly approached the hole to peer in.

It was dark save for the patterened blue streaks across Ramne's chest that showed a row of crates lining the wall in front of him. He opened one and pulled out a metallic cylinder of some sort, looking it over in his hands.

"Yes, that'll do nicely," he said.

He pulled out three others, packed them in a satchel hung over his left shoulder, and shut the crate. Kipnu moved back to avoid being seen, but Ramne stayed below. He looked again and saw Ramne's blue light illuminating the marred features of a familiar face.

"You awake now?" Ramne murmured and reached for hae arm, measuring the life left in hae body.

Casra didn't answer.

"Good," he said with a hint of remorse in his voice. But he didn't stick around to grieve or regret. Kipnu removed himself from the hole as Ramne lifted himself out and covered any sign of there having been a door in the floor.

This would be his last chance to stop Ramne, but surely someone would come to the armory looking for Ramne if he never appeared again. He couldn't risk being found while trying to pull Casra out of whatever state thi was in. And just as quickly as he thought it, the woman from before came through the entryway and barked at him.

"You coming?" she asked in a rush.

He lunged at her, covering nearly half the room in a single step, but she moved out of his way just in time.

His voice boomed at her in a sort of low-pitched growl. "If you ever rush me again, you'll be the one locked in the cellar."

She looked him up and down with a disgusted, dismissive look on her face and ran off back toward the pavilion, while Ramne picked up a spear of his own.

"Time to bring a light back to Ulu," he said, and stepped out into the firelight.

With no time to waste, Kipnu ran over to where he'd entered and signalled to the other four to come in.

"I heard Ramne," said a young man. He was frightened for his life.

"It's okay, Ramne is gone," Kipnu whispered, knowing that the walls, though opaque, were not soundproof. "But we have to move quick. Grab a spear and go fetch the others. Can you do that?"

He nodded and ran off toward the back of the tent, forgetting the spear. Kipnu turned to the others and said, "You three, come with me."

Together they opened the cellar door and descended into the darkness with only Kipnu's memory to light their path.

"This room is a long trench," he told them. "There are crates lining the walls that should be full of antikan, but there may be something else down there. Find the antikan and move it topside."

He started to walk further into the darkness, and one of them asked him, "Where are you going?"

"Casra needs medical attention," he told them, and they didn't speak a word.

He moved to Casra who was still against the wall where Ramne kept hae. Kipnu felt for a pulse. _Still ticking_. Thi began to stir and moan, but Kipnu kept hae still.

"Hey it's me, Kipnu. Stay as still as you can. I'm gonna get you down okay?"

He felt around hae gently for some sort of shackle, noticed a multitude of scrapes and lacerations on hae shoulder and up hae neck.

"How is your head? Does it hurt?" he asked as he moved his hand to hae head. His fingers meandered onto a strange ridge in front of hae ear.

"Ahhhh," thi groaned immediately as his hand came to it.

"Ok. I can work with that."

With graceful and deliberate touches, he assessed the injury, stopping whenever thi moaned in pain. It seemed to be a large welt just in front of hae ear, and it was filling with fluid. He knew it was a skull fracture.

"How did this happen?" he asked hae. But thi didn't respond. He touched hae shoulder and felt a violent shaking in hae body.

"No no that's too soon!" he said to the air.

He removed a firestarter from his satchel and turned its knob. A titanium cylinder spun in a metallic socket, sending small sparks and the odor of magnesium smoke into the air. In one slow motion, he ran the top of the dagger across the tip of the firestarter and its heat turned the blade yellow with oxidation. He turned to the welt and cut open a small hole at the bottom of the welt with a calculated movement of his hand. A mix of blood and fluid formed a tangible rivulet across hae face as the welt emptied, quickly at first but slowing with time. Kipnu dropped the knife and held his fingers fast to hae chest, continuously checking for a pulse as hae consciousness slowly began to return.

"Kipnu," thi said in a daze, "Is that you? Am I dying?"

"You'll be fine," he lied. "Just stay strong."

The other three had finished moving crates and the sound of many footsteps filled the room above, but Kipnu was steeped in concentration, looking for kanosin to use as a pain reducer. He checked the crates that the others had opened, but found no kanosin. Just more of those strange cylinders that Ramne had taken with him.

"Casra?" he called hae name, secretly hoping thi might have gone unconscious again.

"The patient is bleeding everywhere," thi said in a dazed tone, "Needs kan-o..."

"Yes, doctor," he said while he prepared the firestarter again. He could sense that something was amiss. He tapped hae cheeks, but thi didn't wake up. There was little time to save hae.

Penyi's voice interrupted him again, "Kipnu, I see a figure entering the armory."

But he couldn't deal with that now. The firestarter was hot, and the bleeding needed to stop. _"Am I dying?"_ He heard hae slurred voice echo in his mind as he moved his hand closer to hae neck.

"Hold still," he said, in case thi could still hear him. "This will only be a moment."

He wedged his smallest finger into the space of hae fractured skull and pried into the wound to find a path to the source of the blood. _About a quarter finger length in. Right posterior artery._

A blue light entered the room but once again he didn't didn't pay it any mind.

"What are you doing with Casra?" asked a maman angrily.

"I need to stop the bleeding."

He spoke mechanically without moving his head.

"How did..." thi said out loud, but thi walked closer and was repulsed by the blood on hae face.

"You can either help me or stand back," he said abruptly.

Thi helped him restrain hae head and added light to the area. Kipnu separated the plunger from its socket and quickly slid a finger over the tip to check its heat. He winced at the singe it created and waved the finger to cool it down, then carefully inserted the hot plunger into the wound. A sizzling sound began and the air was soaked with the smell of burning flesh. The maman coughed and gagged, walking away from the scene, but Kipnu remained unfazed. He felt around for blood, and it seemed to stop, but Casra's remained unconscious.

"Thi's lost too much blood," said the maman, looking away. "Thi needs kanosin."

Kipnu dismissed hae suggestion, unsurprised that another stranger would think to give him medical advice. But he recalled the blue light, noted that it was brighter than even Setre would have been. The maman turned around and walked to Casra again, unlocking the chains that held hae to the wall with a key from hae pocket, and held hae in hae arms as if to prepare to carry Casra a long distance.

Kipnu drew his dagger and stood in front of Shinna.

"Where are you taking hae?" he asked.

Thi gently set Casra's fading body onto the floor and drew hae thick black robes over hae, plunging the room into darkness. In an instant, he felt the sharp feeling of a blade against his back, a firm grip on his wrist, and he kneeled away from it. Shinna was atop him now, holding his blade arm out and his torso to the ground.

"The next time you try to pull a blade on me, you'll never see daylight again."

Kipnu struggled to break free, but was not in a position to do so. He dropped the dagger, sensing that it was his only way out of this situation, and Shinna kicked it aside.

"The underworld is the only way Casra will survive," Shinna said. "You can either help me or stand back."

Thi let go of him, and went back to Casra.

"Why are you helping hae all of a sudden?"

"Hope fits snugly under my toe. It is a small, fickle thing. But life? Life is far too big a thing to crush - even for a wicked bastard like me."

Thi lifted Casra up and out of the basement with ease, looking back at Kipnu.

"You're a meager little pawn, Kipnu. You're in a war you know nothing about. Never forget: you're my meager little pawn."

Shinna lifted haeself out of the hole and carried Casra through that bustling crowd of revolutionaries, none of them stopping hae or knowing who these two maman were. Thi left through the main fissure and turned hae path toward the cold dark night with only a promise of Casra's safety.

Kipnu lifted himself out of the hole, caught his breath in the armory amongst the clamor of people scrambling for more antikan and spears. A pair of anomin lanterns had been lit but the air was not filled with their sweet smell, but the smell of smoke. He looked for Fanla, but couldn't find her. Nor did he find Ginnu.

Penyi came upon the listener again. "Fire. There's a fire at the Pavilion!"

An overwhelming feeling of dread overcame him, but running was not an option. Setre was still at the pavilion, keeping the guardians off, and even more were treating the sick. His feet pushed the ground beneath him, and out into the cold night.

Some people were rushing out of the pavilion carrying limp bodies. Others were carrying crates of kanosin. Most were standing at a safe distance staring in horror at the sight of their home burning down. Adjacent to the armory, he saw a group of bodies laying on the ground and some people from his group attending to them. Some of them were stirring, and others were not. His eye caught Fanla who stood before several people lying on the ground with soot all over their bodies. He ran toward her, dodging a flurry of people from every direction.

"Fanla! What's going on?" he asked her. Another woman came out of the burning pavilion, carrying two guardians on her shoulders, and set them gently on the ground next to the others.

"We're pulling people out of the pavilion. I need your help."

"Where is Setre?" he asked.

But she didn't know. "Kipnu, these people aren't breathing," thi insisted. "What do we do?"

"If they still have a pulse, press on their chest until they start coughing. Otherwise move on to the next person."

Fanla looked at him, understanding what he was asking her to do but mentally unprepared to do it.

As much as she needed someone to help revive them, he didn't have time. Setre was still in the fire.

A dark smoke hung in the air as he ran into the inferno. Everywhere around him the heat of infrared light alighted upon his cheeks and hands, the rumble roared in his ears, exercising vengeance against the darkness. Ahead of him, there were yells that could scarcely be heard through the fire and spears strewn on the ground as if in a hurry, but there was no sign of Setre.

He called her name but could scarcely be heard above the rumble.

A silhouette appeared on the ground. It was short, resembling a child, but through the lapping of flames and fabric, the silhouette moved and transformed into two figures. One on the ground, and the other hovering over.

"Do you need help?" he said to them. But the kneeling figure ran off toward the back of the pavilion, staying low to the ground.

"Wait!" he said, but the figure had already disappeared. He turned to the person lying on the ground and found Setre.

"Casra...Casra...", her voice had fractured in two and wheezed through labored breaths. But Kipnu was too busy lifting and carrying her to hear.

When he had made it back to Fanla, he set her down gently and began examining her for injury. The entire left side of her head and neck had been disfigured by the flames, and her eyes were dotted with starry cataracts. Setre reached to Kipnu's arm, and tried to gaze at him with vacant eyes, as if she were experiencing some other world far behind the one he was in. She called out again in a voice frailer than before, "Lin..."

"Linyu is safe. No need to worry," he comforted her with her own mysterious words. But her mind was still locked away.

_I need to find Casra._

"The pavilion is clear and the fighting has stopped," he said. "Keep giving antikan to addicts and kanosin to the ones who won't make it. I'm going after Casra."

Fanla, incredulous, averted her focus, "Where are you going?! We need you here!"

"I trust you!"

Kipnu ran into the darkness, exhausted but determined.

The trees transformed as he ventured into the dark. From giant pillars in hues of fire to silent shadows looming over him. The darkness and his belabored feet led him stumbling into trees, discovered only by the faint changes in the sound of his breaths echoing off of the tree in front. Still, he wandered further into the darkness.

He searched for any faint sign of a horizon through the darkness, but he saw none – just darkness as far as the eye could see. He once paused and looked upward toward the sky, searching for the red dots he had seen in the treetops, but the sky was obscured by thick branches hanging high above him in this, the darkest part of Ulukoma. A chilly humidity had taken over the air, mingling with the smell of dead pine needles and ice hanging on his breath.

And salt. _I must be near the shore._

Drawing a few deep breaths, he recommitted his mind and started to run again.

A constant pulse of waves began to fill the darkness, and he could taste more of the salty and frosty mist.

"Casra!" He called toward the sound. There was no answer.

He came to a place where the trees cleared, and the ground had all but turned to sand. Looking out toward the ocean, he was astonished at the scene before him. The seawater was teeming with glowing kelp, a streak of blue light hanging upon every wave, reaching down to the ocean floor. In the sky were more of those strange dots he had seen from the treetops, but far more, marring Ulu like the .

Kipnu refocused on his mission. He called out again, "Casra!"

"Thi's dead," Shinna's voice came from behind him. Kipnu jumped out of surprise and looked around for hae.

"Or alive," thi continued. "Depends on how you look at it, I suppose."

"What did you do to hae?"

There was a moment of silence. Kipnu sensed that thi was moving, but couldn't see where. He lunged at where he thought thi was but he was met with cold thin air and the sound of hae voice above him. Thi spoke with a tone of smoldering rage.

"Burning our home to the ground wasn't enough? Hundreds of people, dead in a moment and still you aren't satisfied."

"The fire? I didn't start that–"

"I love my people. We love our way of life. An Ara-worshipper like you would never understand."

He spoke back through gasps and cries, "Your people are slaves."

Thi circled around him, unraveled hae robe to reveal all of the light infused into hae skin. It blinded him just enough for hae to immobilize him and hold a dagger to his neck.

"And you under Ara aren't? How do you handle those who don't fit your mold of the perfect person? Exile us to the darkness where we won't be a nuisance? Force us into addiction to handle the misery? Burn us all in a fire and make it look like an accident? Psycopaths like you deserve to rot for eternity under the blue. You strip this world of everything good and erase those who dissent."

"It wasn't me," he pleaded. He wanted to show hae somehow that he wasn't the man thi believed him to be, but the words eluded his mind and his lips; only fear was left.

Thi pushed him onto the ground, held his chest firmly under hae foot, and raised hae dagger to strike.

"I gave you a tree, and you burned the forest. Tonight you meet the arbiter of your retribution. And thi is far from kind."

The sound of two feet rustling the forest floor interrupted hae. Thi looked aside, and put hae dagger away, immediately forgetting about Kipnu.

"Ramne, why are you here?" thi asked.

He seemed as surprised as thi was.

"Found a traitor among them," he said. "Thi knew about the saltpeter and the antikan and led them straight to it. Thi's the only one who could have started the fire."

"Your own partner? Are you sure?"

"Absolutely."

He pushed the maman into Shinna's light and held out hae hands.

"See the dust?"

Shinna glanced at hae hands and nodded in assent while Ramne glanced at Kipnu. He had a careless scowl, silhouetted in Shinna's body light, and the skin on his ankles were now exposed from which a bright blue light scattered across the ground around him.

"Looks like you have a rebel of your own," said Ramne.

Shinna responded in an almost mechanical tone.

"These two have caused death and destruction to befall Ulukoma. They deserve what is coming to them."

Kipnu was unaware of what would come next, but he felt the frothing of finality in the air, as if fate itself had reached a boiling point.

"Hold Ginnu for a moment," said Ramne. "I'll get him."

He moved slowly toward Kipnu, who had started to run but found poor footing in the darkness, stumbling over rocks and driftwood strewn across the beach. When Ramne caught up to him, he hadn't gone far.

"I remember you," he said a little too loudly for someone so close. "You gave that rousing speech about your first day in Ulukoma. Welcome to the underworld."

A loud patronizing laugh came out of his mouth, mingling with the acrid smell of stale pohua beer. Kipnu smelled something else too, something distinctly mineral.

Shinna followed behind him with Ginnu's arm in hae hand.

"Let's just be finished," Shinna said. "We need to get out of here soon."

"Patience leads to beautiful things, Shinna."

He put his arm around Kipnu as if they were best friends. Kipnu shrugged it off, but Ramne insisted with a tight grip on his wrist that Kipnu couldn't wrestle free from.

"Now Ginnu has been a loyal partner for countless days and nights. Though hae treachery has caused the suffering of hundreds of individuals, hae death should be swift, painless, poetic even."

He turned to Kipnu and said, "Kipnu, fetch us a small bit of kelp from the water."

Ramne pulled out a long metal tube with some sort of ornate mechanisms attached to it.

"And don't even think about running," he said.

Kipnu looked back at Ramne, confused, but knew this might be his last chance to escape. Slowly, obediently, he waded into the waves, keeping his eyes on Shinna and Ginnu, who both seemed agitated at his situation. The water surprised him with its warmth and the faintest tickles of bubbles that were released as he broke the sand below him. His listener had come alive with a strange sound, almost like voices amongst the static. He felt as if the ocean had come alive and he was headed straight into its belly.

The frail villi-like stalks bent and swayed to his movements, and he reached down to fetch one. The blue light was brighter than even the light from Shinna's body. He suspected that this plant is where Kanosin came from.

With his head submerged, he tugged hard on the vine, trying his best to wrest it from the ground, but he the vine wouldn't give. The leaves were much easier to separate from their vines, and he gathered three for good measure, nestling two under the middle of his tunic. He waded back with a leaf of bluekelp and a plan.

"Do you have it?" Ramne asked. But Kipnu didn't respond.

"Kipnu, do you have the kelp?" he asked again. Kipnu kept walking, with his eyes locked upon Shinna's. When he stopped, he was knee-deep in the water, with Ramne impatiently wading into the water to meet him, all with this metal pipe pointed directly to his chest. Kipnu spotted the window of his opportunity approach, and took Ramne's free hand, filling it with the one kelp leaf he'd kept visible. Ramne pushed him away, keeping the kelp leaf, and proceeded toward Ginnu. Meanwhile, Kipnu's eyes were transfixed on Shinna who began to notice.

"Ginnu, we don't have kanosin for you because you destroyed it all, but I suppose this is the next best thing. Swallow the liquid inside and you'll satisfy the craving you so dearly desire."

Kipnu held his hand up to his nose, sending a signal to Shinna. Thi paused for a moment, then took one step closer to Ginnu and inhaled quietly, so Ramne wouldn't notice. Thi noticed an odor with a quizzical look behind hae face, then looked at the leaf, then to Ramne's hand and a look of understanding formed across hae face.

Ginnu quckly took the leaf into hae mouth and pulled it against hae teeth, letting the contents into hae mouth. Thi soon lost hae balance and slipped into the kanosin trance.

"There you go," Ramne said, laying hae softly onto the sand and unceremoniously squeezed on the instrument in his hand. A loud crack rang out into the air and the dark shadow of hae blood spread across the sand.

"Kipnu, come closer," said Ramne, but he stood perfectly still save for the tremors in his body. Ramne rose the weapon, pointing it toward Kipnu.

"You heard me," he said, and as if in a trance, Kipnu started to walk closer.

"There you go," Ramne said. "Ah, stop right there."

Shinna stood to the side of him, glancing behind haeself as if weighing hae options. Ramne continued as if thi had vanished into the background: a passive audience to his judgment and execution.

"Now Kipnu, on the other hand. He's a real troublemaker. Came to this shithole and got right to work dismantling it all. You might think yourself a noble man, Kip, but that means nothing in this world. You and all your addict friends are the filth of society, the very spirit of Ulu. Ara is the fire that demands your sacrifice. And if you won't give it willingly, it shall be taken from you by force."

Kipnu had heard this way of speaking before, in a Holragi curiosity he'd leafed through on a whim. The teachings inside it struck him as antithetical to everything he believed. The Code of the Conscious, the philosophy of the first Heiko. These are the things that drove him to save lives, to reduce suffering. But now he knew what foul thoughts he was up against, and he met Ramne's gaze with conviction.

"When Ara fades from the sky and you've killed off everyone you ever had a chance to love, I hope you find the decency to regret it all as you die alone in the dark."

He chuckled a quick breath, barely a puff, and told him, "Nobody dies in the dark."

He stared comfortably into Kipnu's eyes as if harvesting Kipnu's emotions to feed his malevolent hunger.

"When the darkness falls and the mainlanders kill each other in the chaos, I'll be there to laugh as it all comes tumbling down."

Kipnu walked closer to challenge him and said, "You're nothing but a twisted drug peddler. The people of this world are nothing like you."

Ramne smirked and adjusted the instrument. "Not yet."

He squeezed the metal instrument with his hand and another shot rang out. Kipnu dove into the water to dodge the projectile, bracing for some kind of stinging pain. But a wave passed, and there was no pain. He surfaced again and found him struggling with Shinna, the metal instrument gripped tightly in his hand. Without thinking, Kipnu rushed in to wrest it from Ramne's hand, grasping tightly at his fingers to pry them off, but they held fast. Shinna was thrown out of the scuffle in a sudden twisting motion and the two men fell to the ground with Ramne underneath. He struggled as Kipnu arrested his arms against his back, and suddenly pushed himself backward to lift Kipnu off of him. As he flew back, Kipnu held on to Ramne's firing arm and inadvertently turned it straight toward himself. Another crack rang out and Kipnu felt the sting of hot metal pierce a bone in his chest, and the flowing of blood his body came in one stream down his abdomen and into the sand. Through fading eyes, he saw Shinna with hae light reflecting off the metal of the instrument, and Ramne vanishing into the night.

"Kipnu!" He heard Shinna's voice calling from above. Or below?

"Don't die on me. Not today."

But through the commotion and the fickle passage of time, another voice was interred in his ear and slept there with him in his final moment.

"Kipnu... Melna... I love you."
