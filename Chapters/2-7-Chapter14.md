## Chapter 14


	Kip paused the group in their walk toward the Shadestead, smelling the first hints of fire in the air. He turned around and signaled to them to gather in close to him.

	"From this point on, Linyu and I will be guiding you from above, so I want to go over a few things. What you see and what we see may not be the same, so use your own judgment and decide what's best. Stay with your partners at all times; if one of them is hurt, make sure that the area is safe and get out. If they have a listener, take it off of them and put it on yourself. If any one of Lissa's guardians gets a hold of one we could all be captured, so do not let this happen. And finally, Do Not Kill; I repeat Do Not Kill unless they are endangering your life or your partner's life. Setre will be there and she cannot be harmed. Everyone clear?"

	"Yea," the said in a broken unison.

	"Voices off, everyone clear?"

	They nodded in a much clearer unison.

	"Stay here until you hear me through your listeners. I'll join you once the you begin. Good luck, everyone."

	He put his arm around Lin and said, "Lead the way." Lin took him through the forest, ever closer to the fire until they came upon an old tree that was leaning due to shifting clay in the ground.

	"This one," thi said, already starting to climb.

	Kip was concerned, "Is there a closer tree?"

	"This is the tree you start on. We can travel between trees once we get up above."

	He looked up into the dark abyss, and put his full trust in Linyu. They tied a rope to each other, one to the transmitter, and another long one for rappeling back down, and began the climb up the tree. They were relying on the lean of the tree to support their weight on each vault to the next position. With such a large tree, Kip was struggling to wrap his legs in a way that would secure him, but he watched as Linyu focused on scaling it with hae feet in the various crevasses that formed out of the bark.

	"Wait up, Linyu," he said, feeling an upward tug on the rope.

	"Sorry, Kipnu."

	Nearing the top, Kip could see branches, which served as nice places to rest, and the beginning of a canopy, with hints of Ara at the top.

	"Why is it so bright up here?"

	"These trees are so tall so their leaves can reach Ara's light."

	"How do you mean?"

	"You'll see."

	When they reached an area with several smaller branches, they could see clear rays of red light peering between the densely-packed thin leaves dancing with the wind above. Lin led him along one of them so they could reach the end and peek their heads above the canopy. The light of Ara beamed straight into his eyes, and he had to shield them for a moment.

	"Why is it so bright up here?"

	"When you've been in the dark for so long, the light can seem painful."

	He finally opened his eyes, and was amazed at what he saw. Shaki Bay, with Ara in a gradient from dark to light. The Shaki Mountains, the Northern one out of which the city was carved. And the lines of houses and farms, mere specks on the land that formed a geometric pattern as natural as Ara itself.

	"Absolutely beautiful," he said. Linyu remained quiet, remembering all the times hae mother brought hae there. Kip secured his footing and turned around to look toward Ulu. Through the darkness, Kip could see cloud cover for at least as far as he could see, which was only about the length of the island. But if he stared long enough, he could see tiny specks of faint red and infrared hanging in the sky.

  "Linyu, what are those red dots?" he asked, pointing toward the horizon.

  "Don't know. Mom calls them Ara's children. They're always right above the clouds when Ara is far away."

  "And they've always been there?"

  "Always."

  Kip was transfixed on them, wondering why he had never seen them on the mainland. but he snapped out of his temporary obsession, remembering that they still had a job to do.

  "Well, shall we move a bit closer?" He asked.

  "Can I ask you something first?"

  He hesitated, "Well, sure."

  "Once this ends, and you go back to your home on the mainland. Don't forget about us."

  Hae doubtful eyes peered into a part of himself he had long forgotten. As if Linyu was directing Kip's subconscious, and he himself was just a passenger.

  "I could never forget about you, Linyu. Or your mother, or your nather. I will find a way to clear Ara and I'll come back to tell you all the stories."

  "That's what every outsider says to the people they meet while they're here. They never come back."

  Kip felt a tear well up without surfacing. He wanted to say *I'm not whoever disappointed you. I mean the things that I say*. But instead he cracked a small smile to cover up his sadness and said, "No excuses, no mistakes. You have my word."

  But Linyu didn't smile; thi gathered hae things and climbed across the canopy, toward the clearing where the great fire burned brightly in the darkness below.

	They reached the base of a long thick branch that jutted its way into the opening, and Linyu found a coil wrapped around a smaller branch that grew out of it. Kip pulled up the battery and wrapped the slack rope in a simple knot around the smaller branch while Linyu twisted wires from the transmitter box to the coil ends. One-by-one, Linyu checked all of the connections and oriented the long face of the box toward the ground. Kip pulled a listener out of a satchel he was carrying and held it to his ear as an eager Linyu positioned haeself to speak into the transmitter.

	Thi spoke into the transmitter with anticipation, "If you can hear this, we're ready to go," and then laughed at Kip who had pulled it away from his ear because it was so loud.

	"It's louder, the closer you are," thi said.

	"Yea, I figured that out!" he exclaimed, putting the listener back into his satchel. The two looked over the big branch onto the Shadestead, making mental maps of the terrain and feeling the warm smoky currents from the fire mix with the wind. They counted seven blue lights from guardians scattered around the fire. Two of them were sparring with sticks near the kitchen and the others were eating a late dinner closer to the armory.

	Kip moved to the transmitter and said, "Seven guardians around the fire. Five near the armory. Approach from the East, everyone. Approach from the East."

	Linyu pointed to the south as the first signs of movement came from their group, moving in a line toward the Shadestead and shifting their movement to the East. *Setre's plan is working!*, he whispered.

	Their view of the armory was slightly obscured, but they watched as the group circled around it from the back.

	He noticed one of the eating guardians look to the side, and he quickly said, "Stop! Stop!" into the transmitter. They did, and the guardian went back to eating.

	"Walk slower and spread out," he said. And they watched as the group followed his orders. Once they reached the back side of the armory, Kip addressed the most agile maman in the group, "Penyi, go in and survey the place. The rest of you, sit tight and get your bearings." Kip kept his eyes on the guardians, watching every move and thinking of contingencies in case they did catch on. Moments stretched longer and longer until Kip began to feel uneasy about the time it was taking to search a tent so small.

	He asked Linyu, "What do you think is taking hae so long?"

	Thi shrugged and kept watching the scene, but Kip was getting impatient.

	"I'm going down there"

	"But I need you up here," thi said.

	"You'll be fine. It's just calling out things you see."

	"But-"

	He unwrapped the rope from Linyu and looped it around the first branch

	"I'll be right back," he said.

	"Kip!"

	But he was off, heading down the tree before thi could stop him.

	Back on the ground, Kip took the rope off and followed the pathway the group had taken as quickly and quietly as they had. Nearing the group, he saw their listeners and remembered to put his own on.

  "Hey, what's going on?" he asked them at a whisper.

  A maman told him, "Not sure. Penyi went in, then... nothing."

  "I'm going in. Someone come with me to be a messenger in case something goes wrong."

  "I'll go," whispered a woman. She came forward on all fours to quiet her movements, introducing herself, "I am Fanla, a tracker from Heiko."

  She was young, likely the kind who had come to Ulukoma on a whim. But fear was not apparent in her expressions - only excitement.

  "Ok Fanla. Follow a few paces behind me. If I get hit, you run, got it?"

  "Got it," She said.

  They tiptoed toward the armory tent, and Kip peeked underneath the cloth on the ground. He saw nothing but racks full of spears and a faint blue light from a bottle at the top of the tent. He slipped underneath with minimal effort and slowly stood up as he continued to look around. His ears listening for any sign of trouble from the fire or from Lin, he began surveying the tent a little closer than he had before. All was blue and still, with no sign of Penyi. *Thi didn't just vanish*. He took up a spear and with one last glance at the room, signaled under the wall for Fanla to come in.

  They both slowly walked around the room, looking at the weapons that were stockpiled - daggers, spears, swords, bows and arrows. All hardened and sharpened to an infinitesimal edge.

	"Hey, look at this," Fanla beckoned from another side of the tent.

	Kip shot a glance toward her feet where a small wooden door lay among the thin damp leaves. Its greased steel hinges and handle were made to be precise and quiet as it closed and opened.

	"Maybe this is where Penyi went," she said.

	"Maybe," he said, taking up two daggers and handing one to Penyi. "I'll go down there. Stay here at the door."

	Her apprehensive hands took the dagger and she looked up with resolve and concern for Kipnu, but he couldn't quell them - he had to find Fanla. With a creak, the door swung out and Kip pinned his arms and legs against the walls of a long narrow hole in the ground, descending into the darkness with only the blue light on his chest to guide him.
