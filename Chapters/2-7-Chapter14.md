## Chapter 14

Kipnu stopped them at the top of the hill overlooking the pavilion, smelling the first hints of fire in the air. Ara was but a reddish sliver on the horizon, a view that he never fathomed to see. He turned around and signaled to them to gather in close. Huddled to his right was Fanla, who held the length of rope binding Ginnu's hands. It was an unpleasant position for the both of them, but she understood the weight of the job.

"From this point on, we'll split into the two groups I mentioned before. Stay with your partners at all times; if one of them is hurt, make sure that the area is safe and get the both of yourselves out of here. If they have a listener, take it off of them and put it on yourself. If you're about to be captured, destroy it. We cannot let them get a hold of one. And finally, we are not here to fight, we are here to liberate. Even if we have all of the weapons and antikan on Ulukoma, we wouldn't be able to defeat the guardians. Do not attack unless your life is in danger. Everyone clear?"

They made a gesture with their hands in assent, a sort of salute of honor that Kipnu had learned from Melna.

"Ground team, stay here until you hear us through your listeners. Sky team, let's move."

Kipnu took him through the forest, ever closer to the fire until they came upon a tree with a slight lean toward the pavilion. Its roots looked as sturdy as any other tree and its trunk was littered with a coil here and there, a sign that Linyu had often climbed it.

"This one," he whispered, looking up into the dark abyss, imagining Linyu there among its branches. He tied a rope to himself, leaving two long ends free, and began the climb up the tree. The lean helped to support their weight on each vault to the next position. With such a large tree, Kipnu was struggling to secure his footing on the bark, but he learned to find the various crevasses that formed out of the bark and use them to his advantage.

He came to a large branch and tossed one of the ropes at his back over the top of it, and a woman below took the other end in her hands. There was such a strong sense of safety in something so simple as a friendly hand end of a rope, he thought. He shook his hands to clear out any soreness and dry the water from his palms. There was another half to go.

A plethora of branches and rays of red light greeted him near the top, where he tossed the other rope over the thickest branch he could find and gave it a good shake to signal that he was ready. Now all he had to do was wait for the others to join him.

This place was bathed in the light of Ara, a sprawling terrain of densely-packed leaves and branches bobbing in the wind, spread across the horizon's curve like the earth itself had become an ocean. He had shield his eyes from the searing brightness to look in the direction of the mainland. In the distance to the north, he could make out the Shaki Mountains, and saw some lights from the hill where Yansha sat. A bit to the south was the Rudjan wetlands, lit brightly with the boat lanterns he'd heard about but never saw for himself. And all along the coast were lines of houses and farms and patches of trees, mere specks on the land that formed a geometric pattern as natural as Ara itself.

He turned around to look toward Ulu. Through the darkness, Kipnu could see patches of clouds that faded into Ulu. But if he stared long enough, he could see tiny specks of faint red and infrared hanging in the sky, ever still, ever bright. Like the small children of Ara. He wondered at what they might be, how long they'd been just beyond the veil of Ara.

Three people in total made it up the tree, shielding their eyes and gasping at the beauty of what they were seeing. They made their way from tree to tree atop the intertwined branches and toward the clearing that marked the fire and the pavilion. They came upon a larger tree at the perimeter of the clearing they'd been looking for and perched to look below, making mental maps of the terrain and feeling the warm smoky currents from the fire mix with the wind. They counted seven blue lights from guardians scattered around the fire. Two of them were sparring with sticks near the kitchen and the others were eating a late dinner closer to the armory.

Kipnu pulled a listener out of a satchel he was carrying and removed the coil assembly from the wooden puck. With a small tool he'd found in Casra's home, he cleaved a hole into the branch and inserted the end of the coil that stuck out, giving time for the fresh wet wood take to it. As they waited, they watched as the last sliver of light extinguished itself into the ground, and an eerie feeling overcame them. They knew that this strange new kind of darkness would soon be everywhere.

A maman, Penyi, produced a listener of hae own and asked for Kipnu to say something into the newly fastened coil.

"The wind speaks," he said with tone of conviction: the sort that Casra spoke with. He'd hoped that Setre was listening.

The maman with the listener nodded to him and he smiled, knowing Linyu's work hadn't gone to waste. He made a departing gesture to the three and made his way back across the branches and down the leaning tree, all the while wondering about in those strange red dots in the sky, and Linyu's strange blue eyes in the deep.

"Seven guardians around the fire," he told the ground team. "Five near the armory. We'll approach from Ulu-side."

And without a moment to pause, he led them in a sparse line through the forest, around the pavilion grounds and further into the dark.

Penyi's voice chimed in through the listener. "There's a commotion in the pavilion," thi said, "The guardians are leaving the armory."

"Now's our chance," he told them. "I need four volunteers to come with me. Walk silently and spread out."

He didn't stop to choose but began walking right as he'd given the order. He knew that time was short.

They reached the back side of the armory tent and Kipnu switched to gestures: a hand from his chest to the underside of the tent, then onto the ground in a waving motion. The four rose their hands in confirmation and he went down into the dirt, underneath the cloth, and arose in a makeshift room lit only by the fire from the far side. He firmly grasped his stolen spear and looked for signs of movement, but saw only racks upon racks of spears and daggers and huge fishing nets with metal weights, All of them hardened and polished to a mirror finish.

"Three guardians running toward the armory," said Penyi, and Kinpu suddenly found himself in the middle of the tent, looking for a place to hide. He considered running back toward the place he came in, but knew that if they spotted him, they would be led to the others. There was no option but to stay far away, taking cover behind racks and move with them.

"Those damned traitors," said a woman as she entered.

A man's voice followed hers, "We need fifty, maybe sixty. Fetch fifteen, each of you. I'll handle the rest."

_Ramne. Of course he's leading the counter-resistance._

Kipnu's eyes were trained upon the three figures, watching every move, thinking of contingencies in case they noticed him there in the corner. But for now, they were focused on their work.

"You done yet?" said Ramne, impatiently piling spears into their already-full arms. Ramne's lackies had cleared the racks near their side of the armory, and ran off on their way to fight Setre's force, leaving Ramne alone with him.

_I could dispatch Ramne now. Just a dagger in the back_, he thought, _wipe that smugness clean off his face_.

Kipnu took a dagger carefully from the stand in front of him, and held it snugly in his hands, imagined getting close enough to land a solid blow in one quick motion. But Ramne had other plans. He paced the racks up and down, with Kipnu moving between the racks discreetly to stay out of his line of sight.

"Ahh," he whispered to himself atop a conspicuously placed carpet. "Just what I was looking for."

He tossed aside the carpet and revealed a small wooden door among the thin damp leaves that had meandered there. Its polished hinges and edge moulding were too precise to be made in Ulukoma – closer to Shaki design – but the hinges were covered in a thick grease, as if whoever had placed it there wanted to be the only person using it. With a small jump Ramne fell into the hole, landing squarely upon a stone floor below. _What's he want antikan for?_ Kipnu wondered, and he slowly approached the hole to peer in.

It was dark save for the patterened blue streaks across Ramne's chest that showed a row of crates lining the wall in front of him. He opened one and pulled out a metallic cylinder of some sort, looking it over in his hands.

"Yes, that'll do nicely," he said.

He pulled out three others, packed them in a satchel hung over his left shoulder, and shut the crate. Kipnu moved back to avoid being seen, but Ramne stayed below. He looked again and saw Ramne's blue light illuminating the marred features of a familiar face.

"You awake now?" Ramne murmured and reached for hae arm, measuring the life left in hae body.

Casra didn't answer.

"Good," he said with a hint of remorse in his voice. But he didn't stick around to grieve or regret. Kipnu removed himself from the hole as Ramne lifted himself out and covered any sign of there having been a door in the floor.

This would be his last chance to stop Ramne, but surely someone would come to the armory looking for Ramne if he never appeared again. He couldn't risk being found while trying to pull Casra out of whatever state thi was in. And just as quickly as he thought it, the woman from before came through the entryway and barked at him.

"You coming?" she asked in a rush.

He lunged at her, covering nearly half the room in a single step, but she moved out of his way just in time.

His voice boomed at her in a sort of low-pitched growl. "If you ever rush me again, you'll be the one locked in the cellar."

She looked him up and down with a disgusted, dismissive look on her face and ran off back toward the pavilion, while Ramne picked up a spear of his own.

"Time to bring a light back to Ulu," he said, and stepped out into the firelight.

With no time to waste, Kipnu ran over to where he'd entered and signalled to the other four to come in.

"I heard Ramne," said a young man. He was frightened for his life.

"It's okay, Ramne is gone," Kipnu whispered, knowing that the walls, though opaque, were not soundproof. "But we have to move quick. Grab a spear and go fetch the others. Can you do that?"

He nodded and ran off toward the back of the tent, forgetting the spear. Kipnu turned to the others and said, "You three, come with me."

Together they opened the cellar door and descended into the darkness with only Kipnu's memory to light their path.

"This room is a long trench," he told them. "There are crates lining the walls that should be full of antikan, but there may be something else down there. Find the antikan and move it topside."

He started to walk further into the darkness, and one of them asked him, "Where are you going?"

"Casra needs medical attention," he told them, and they didn't speak a word.

He moved to Casra who was still against the wall where Ramne kept hae. Kipnu felt for a pulse. _Still ticking_. Thi began to stir and moan, but Kipnu kept hae still.

"Hey it's me, Kipnu. Stay as still as you can. I'm gonna get you down okay?"

He felt around hae gently for some sort of shackle, noticed a multitude of scrapes and lacerations on hae shoulder and up hae neck.

"How is your head? Does it hurt?" he asked as he moved his hand to hae head. His fingers meandered onto a strange ridge in front of hae ear.

"Ahhhh," thi groaned immediately as his hand came to it.

"Ok. I can work with that."

With graceful and deliberate touches, he assessed the injury, stopping whenever thi moaned in pain. It seemed to be a large welt just in front of hae ear, and it was filling with fluid. He knew it was a skull fracture.

"How did this happen?" he asked hae. But thi didn't respond. He touched hae shoulder and felt a violent shaking in hae body.

"No no that's too soon!" he said to the air.

He removed a firestarter from his satchel and turned its knob. A titanium cylinder spun in a metallic socket, sending small sparks and the odor of magnesium smoke into the air. In one slow motion, he ran the top of the dagger across the tip of the firestarter and its heat turned the blade yellow with oxidation. He turned to the welt and cut open a small hole at the bottom of the welt with a calculated movement of his hand. A mix of blood and fluid formed a tangible rivulet across hae face as the welt emptied, quickly at first but slowing with time. Kipnu dropped the knife and held his fingers fast to hae chest, continuously checking for a pulse as hae consciousness slowly began to return.

"Kipnu," thi said in a daze, "Is that you? Am I dying?"

"You'll be fine," he lied. "Just stay strong."

The other three had finished moving crates and the sound of many footsteps filled the room above, but Kipnu was steeped in concentration, looking for kanosin to use as a pain reducer. He checked the crates that the others had opened, but found no kanosin. Just more of those strange cylinders that Ramne had taken with him.

"Casra?" he called hae name, secretly hoping thi might have gone unconscious again.

"The patient is bleeding everywhere," thi said in a dazed tone, "Needs kan-o..."

"Yes, doctor," he said while he prepared the firestarter again. He could sense that something was amiss. He tapped hae cheeks, but thi didn't wake up. There was little time to save hae.

Penyi's voice interrupted him again, "Kipnu, I see a figure entering the armory."

But he couldn't deal with that now. The firestarter was hot, and the bleeding needed to stop. _"Am I dying?"_ He heard hae slurred voice echo in his mind as he moved his hand closer to hae neck.

"Hold still," he said, in case thi could still hear him. "This will only be a moment."

He wedged his smallest finger into the space of hae fractured skull and pried into the wound to find a path to the source of the blood. _About a quarter finger length in. Right posterior artery._

A blue light entered the room but once again he didn't didn't pay it any mind.

"What are you doing with Casra?" asked a maman angrily.

"I need to stop the bleeding."

He spoke mechanically without moving his head.

"How did..." thi said out loud, but thi walked closer and was repulsed by the blood on hae face.

"You can either help me or stand back," he said abruptly.

Thi helped him restrain hae head and added light to the area. Kipnu separated the plunger from its socket and quickly slid a finger over the tip to check its heat. He winced at the singe it created and waved the finger to cool it down, then carefully inserted the hot plunger into the wound. A sizzling sound began and the air was soaked with the smell of burning flesh. The maman coughed and gagged, walking away from the scene, but Kipnu remained unfazed. He felt around for blood, and it seemed to stop, but Casra's remained unconscious.

"Thi's lost too much blood," said the maman, looking away. "Thi needs kanosin."

Kipnu dismissed hae suggestion, unsurprised that another stranger would think to give him medical advice. But he recalled the blue light, noted that it was brighter than even Setre would have been. The maman turned around and walked to Casra again, unlocking the chains that held hae to the wall with a key from hae pocket, and held hae in hae arms as if to prepare to carry Casra a long distance.

Kipnu drew his dagger and stood in front of Shinna.

"Where are you taking hae?" he asked.

Thi gently set Casra's fading body onto the floor and drew hae thick black robes over hae, plunging the room into darkness. In an instant, he felt the sharp feeling of a blade against his back, a firm grip on his wrist, and he kneeled away from it. Shinna was atop him now, holding his blade arm out and his torso to the ground.

"The next time you try to pull a blade on me, you'll never see daylight again."

Kipnu struggled to break free, but was not in a position to do so. He dropped the dagger, sensing that it was his only way out of this situation, and Shinna kicked it aside.

"The underworld is the only way Casra will survive," Shinna said. "You can either help me or stand back."

Thi let go of him, and went back to Casra.

"Why are you helping hae all of a sudden?"

"Hope fits snugly under my toe. It is a small, fickle thing. But life? Life is far too big a thing to crush - even for a wicked bastard like me."

Thi lifted Casra up and out of the basement with ease, looking back at Kipnu.

"You're a meager little pawn, Kipnu. You're in a war you know nothing about. Never forget: you're my meager little pawn."

Shinna lifted haeself out of the hole and carried Casra through that bustling crowd of revolutionaries, none of them stopping hae or knowing who these two maman were. Thi left through the main fissure and turned hae path toward the cold dark night with only a promise of Casra's safety.

Kipnu lifted himself out of the hole, caught his breath in the armory amongst the clamor of people scrambling for more antikan and spears. A pair of anomin lanterns had been lit but the air was not filled with their sweet smell, but the smell of smoke. He looked for Fanla, but couldn't find her. Nor did he find Ginnu.

Penyi came upon the listener again. "Fire. There's a fire at the Pavilion!"

An overwhelming feeling of dread overcame him, but running was not an option. Setre was still at the pavilion, keeping the guardians off, and even more were treating the sick. His feet pushed the ground beneath him, and out into the cold night.

Some people were rushing out of the pavilion carrying limp bodies. Others were carrying crates of kanosin. Most were standing at a safe distance staring in horror at the sight of their home burning down. Adjacent to the armory, he saw a group of bodies laying on the ground and some people from his group attending to them. Some of them were stirring, and others were not. His eye caught Fanla who stood before several people lying on the ground with soot all over their bodies. He ran toward her, dodging a flurry of people from every direction.

"Fanla! What's going on?" he asked her. Another woman came out of the burning pavilion, carrying two guardians on her shoulders, and set them gently on the ground next to the others.

"We're pulling people out of the pavilion. I need your help."

"Where is Setre?" he asked.

But she didn't know. "Kipnu, these people aren't breathing," thi insisted. "What do we do?"

"If they still have a pulse, press on their chest until they start coughing. Otherwise move on to the next person."

Fanla looked at him, understanding what he was asking her to do but mentally unprepared to do it.

As much as she needed someone to help revive them, he didn't have time. Setre was still in the fire.

A dark smoke hung in the air as he ran into the inferno. Everywhere around him the heat of infrared light alighted upon his cheeks and hands, the rumble roared in his ears, exercising vengeance against the darkness. Ahead of him, there were yells that could scarcely be heard through the fire and spears strewn on the ground as if in a hurry, but there was no sign of Setre.

He called her name but could scarcely be heard above the rumble.

A silhouette appeared on the ground. It was short, resembling a child, but through the lapping of flames and fabric, the silhouette moved and transformed into two figures. One on the ground, and the other hovering over.

"Do you need help?" he said to them. But the kneeling figure ran off toward the back of the pavilion, staying low to the ground.

"Wait!" he said, but the figure had already disappeared. He turned to the person lying on the ground and found Setre.

"Casra...Casra...", her voice had fractured in two and wheezed through labored breaths. But Kipnu was too busy lifting and carrying her to hear.

When he had made it back to Fanla, he set her down gently and began examining her for injury. The entire left side of her head and neck had been disfigured by the flames, and her eyes were dotted with starry cataracts. Setre reached to Kipnu's arm, and tried to gaze at him with vacant eyes, as if she were experiencing some other world far behind the one he was in. She called out again in a voice frailer than before, "Lin..."

"Linyu is safe. No need to worry," he comforted her with her own mysterious words. But her mind was still locked away.

_I need to find Casra._

"The pavilion is clear and the fighting has stopped," he said. "Keep giving antikan to addicts and kanosin to the ones who won't make it. I'm going after Casra."

Fanla, incredulous, averted her focus, "Where are you going?! We need you here!"

"I trust you!"

Kipnu ran into the darkness, exhausted but determined.

The trees transformed as he ventured into the dark. From giant pillars in hues of fire to silent shadows looming over him. The darkness and his belabored feet led him stumbling into trees, discovered only by the faint changes in the sound of his breaths echoing off of the tree in front. Still, he wandered further into the darkness.

He searched for any faint sign of a horizon through the darkness, but he saw none – just darkness as far as the eye could see. He once paused and looked upward toward the sky, searching for the red dots he had seen in the treetops, but the sky was obscured by thick branches hanging high above him in this, the darkest part of Ulukoma. A chilly humidity had taken over the air, mingling with the smell of dead pine needles and ice hanging on his breath.

And salt. _I must be near the shore._

Drawing a few deep breaths, he recommitted his mind and started to run again.

A constant pulse of waves began to fill the darkness, and he could taste more of the salty and frosty mist.

"Casra!" He called toward the sound. There was no answer.

He came to a place where the trees cleared, and the ground had all but turned to sand. Looking out toward the ocean, he was astonished at the scene before him. The seawater was teeming with glowing kelp, a streak of blue light hanging upon every wave, reaching down to the ocean floor. In the sky were more of those strange dots he had seen from the treetops, but far more, marring Ulu like the .

Kipnu refocused on his mission. He called out again, "Casra!"

"Thi's dead," Shinna's voice came from behind him. Kipnu jumped out of surprise and looked around for hae.

"Or alive," thi continued. "Depends on how you look at it, I suppose."

"What did you do to hae?"

There was a moment of silence. Kipnu sensed that thi was moving, but couldn't see where. He lunged at where he thought thi was but he was met with cold thin air and the sound of hae voice above him. Thi spoke with a tone of smoldering rage.

"Burning our home to the ground wasn't enough? Hundreds of people, dead in a moment and still you aren't satisfied."

"The fire? I didn't start that–"

"I love my people. We love our way of life. An Ara-worshipper like you would never understand."

He spoke back through gasps and cries, "Your people are slaves."

Thi circled around him, unraveled hae robe to reveal all of the light infused into hae skin. It blinded him just enough for hae to immobilize him and hold a dagger to his neck.

"And you under Ara aren't? How do you handle those who don't fit your mold of the perfect person? Exile us to the darkness where we won't be a nuisance? Force us into addiction to handle the misery? Burn us all in a fire and make it look like an accident? Psycopaths like you deserve to rot for eternity under the blue. You strip this world of everything good and erase those who dissent."

"It wasn't me," he pleaded. He wanted to show hae somehow that he wasn't the man thi believed him to be, but the words eluded his mind and his lips; only fear was left.

Thi pushed him onto the ground, held his chest firmly under hae foot, and raised hae dagger to strike.

"I gave you a tree," thi said. "And you burned the forest. Tonight you will burn with us."

The sound of two feet rustling the forest floor interrupted hae. Thi looked aside, and put hae dagger away, immediately forgetting about Kipnu.

"Ramne, why are you here?" thi asked.

He seemed as surprised as thi was.

"Found a traitor among them," he said. "Thi knew about the saltpeter and the antikan and led them straight to it. Thi's the only one who could have started the fire."

"Your own partner? Are you sure?"

"Absolutely."

He pushed the maman into Shinna's light and held out hae hands.

"See the dust?"

Shinna glanced at hae hands and nodded in assent while Ramne looked on at Kipnu.

"Looks like you have a rebel of your own," said Ramne.

<!-- left off -->

Thi lowered haeself to put hae face in front of his.

"You think we're a broken society? I'll tell you what we are. We tried to make the only home that made sense to us. Those who threatened us remained in their drunken stupor, while the rest of us made the best we could from their labor.

But you just couldn't stand it, could you? You had to come here and burn it all down. Nobody here can have a shred of fucking happiness."

    Thi took hae hand away from Kipnu's neck and he gasped for air between tears and cries of pain. Shinna rummaged in hae dressings and took out an ornate pipe, well-used and wooden, and lit it with a hot tip. The embers were slow to light, and few to number, but thi took a drag anyway.

    "Why fire?" thi asked, crouching a few paces away. "You could have ambushed us or held some of us for ransom. But fire. Why?"

    He mustered up what little strength he had to answer, "I didn't..."

    Thi hesitated a bit.

    "Stop lying."

    "I... didn't"

    Thi looked over at him, and for the first time showed some doubt.

    They spent a moment in the cold, saying nothing. The blue waves projected countless patterns across Shinna's pale-cold face. Thi reached for the pipe from Kipnu and took two more deep inhales before bringing it back to him and removing hae dagger from his hand and the ground. He cried out again

    Thi set the blade in hae own left palm and stared at the blood.

    "I took pride in what I built. In outsmarting everyone who stood in my way. I want you to remember that, Kipnu. I want you to remember who we were."

    Thi turned back to Kipnu and helped him sit up. He could see tears welling up in hae eyes in between the refraction of his own.

    "My dream was always to make a home for those who felt they had none. Swear to me you'll remember that."

    Kipnu started to lose some cognition, but the cold acted as his last thread to coherence. He looked up at hae, pensively toying with the knife and said, "I swear it."

    Thi stood up and looked out to the ocean, taking hae time pondering about the past couple days.

    Thi let the wind carry hae words to him, "This is how thi wanted to die. Dancing in the undying light that Ulu created. Casra and I buried a friend here once. Back when I still believed in hae promise. But this isn't the way it was supposed to happen."

    Thi turned back to him, "Kipnu. Remember that nobody dies in the darkness." A pause punctuated the air and did nothing to help Kipnu understand.

    Shinna lifted her hand and pointed to giant boulder in the distance, "Thirty paces toward Thassa's island. Don't let hae die."

    He immediately looked out toward the water, and glanced back to find Shinna walking back into the forest. With a rush of adrenaline, he leapt toward the ocean and didn't look back.

    *The water is... warm?* He was slightly disconcerted at the warmth amidst the faint tickles of bluekelp as he swam past, as if the ocean itself had come alive and he was headed straight into its belly. The frail villi-like stalks bent and swayed to his movements, their light and making it easier to look for Casra. Amidst all the noise of his swimming, he thought he could hear voices amongst the static in his listener, but he ignored it and kept searching.

    Once he reached about 30 paces, he dove underwater to look for hae and was faced with a forest of light. It was impossible to see more than a few paces away, and his muscles were becoming slow to respond, but he carried on anyway, diving several times to look for the silhouette of a body.

    Casra had both hae hands and legs tied to several bluekelp around hae; loosely as if to make hae suffer before drowning. Kipnu started to tear some of the kelp off of Casra, but it was tougher than he had predicted it to be, and he got nowhere with that plan. On his second dive, he attempted to pull the tightest kelp off of the rocky seafloor, and with some effort it came loose and Casra surfaced.

    He heard a sound in his listener again, but it was much more audible, "Prepare for ignition".

    Putting it out of his mind, he went for a third dive to pull more kelp. *Three, Two more to go.* Above him, Casra was lightly wrapped by the light of the bluekelp that had once held hae down. He surfaced again to catch his breath, only taking two breaths before plunging back into the deep. Hallucinations of stars and flashing lights clouded his sight as he reached the bottom again. The last kelp seemed the most stubborn – its roots buried deep into the sand and its vines securely fastened to Casra's left arm. He tied the base of the stem around his arm and kept pulling, feeling his muscles giving away their last bits of strength and his lungs failing to keep their hold on the air. They let a sip of salt slip in, then two, and then the taste of salt permeated his cognition and filled him with panic. He choked in reflex and pushed off from the ground to try to surface, but his arm was held back. The omnipresent blue light amongst the trickles of sand against his skin disoriented him as he fought to unravel himself. Up had become down, and down had become up, and he was lost in between.

    As the darkness closed in on him, his listless gaze found Casra's shape, wrapped in blue light, peaceful and solemn.

    The listener spoke again, "Kipnu... Melna... I love you."

<!-- left off -->

<!--


    After 80 presses with no pulse or breathing, he stopped and slowly removed Ginnu's body from his own. He looked into hae lifeless eyes once more, both of their chests blue with kanosin, illuminating the space between life and death.

    "I'll come back for you," he told hae, wishing he could be certain. An overwhelming air of failure welled up in him, but he pushed it down and forced himself to run away.


 trying to convince them that  The hope of Casra's return had kept them alive, and now that hope was gone.



 Kipnu heard the clanging of weapons, hoped that Setre was doing well.




 Some of those who knew Casra cried out at the sight of hae body. They leaped to wrest hae free from Shinna's arms, but hae strength was much greater than theirs.


"Linyu, what are those red dots?" he asked, pointing toward the horizon.

"Don't know. Mom calls them Ara's children. They're always right above the clouds when Ara is far away."

"And they've always been there?"

"Always."

Kipnu was transfixed on them, wondering why he had never seen them on the mainland. but he snapped out of his temporary obsession, remembering that they still had a job to do. -->

<!--
Kipnu shot a glance toward hae feet where

"Maybe this is where they went," thi said.

"Maybe," he said, taking up two daggers and handing one to Ginnu. Hae hands took the dagger as thi looked up with concern and confusion, but he could do nothing to quell it - they had to find the missing scouts. Kipnu kneeled down at the edge of the hole and with an imperceptible creak, he swung the door open to uncover a tunnel big enough for one leading into the darkness.

"I've never seen this before," thi said.

"This place gets stranger the longer I'm here," he responded.

After a pause, thi said. "Let me go first. I won't raise suspicion."

"After you."

With their hands against the wall, they made their way into the tunnel with only the blue light on Kipnu's chest to light the way. After only a few steps, Ginnu suddenly and silently vanished, followed by a loud thump that reverberated in a space bigger than he could imagine.

"Ginnu?!" he yelled out to hae, but there was no answer.

He moved a little closer and came upon a sharp cut off in the ground where there was no more reflection of the blue light against anything in front of him. *A room. Dug into the ground like Shaki*, he thought. He sat down on the edge to try and feel for where the ground was in front of him, but he stopped when he heard the sound of footsteps on dust from far away in front of him. With his right arm, he covered his blue mark, readying his dagger in the other and watched as the mysterious person came closer. The figure stopped immediately below him, several strides down and removed a shirt to reveal the bright blue markings of a guardian. The light bounced off of the ground and illuminated the face of Ramne, examining at the body lying on the floor in front of him.

Once Ramne had created enough distance, Kipnu hid the dagger in his pouch and started his search for the ground, slowly swinging his leg down and off the ledge. On the third swing, he broadened his search, and his toe hit a steel peg, causing him to wince and fight every urge to scream. He took a moment to regain his calm while the throbbing pain passed and proceeded to carefully move his hands to the peg. It was grooved in a peculiar way and the bottom was covered with a thick layer of rust, but after a few swipes he was sure he could get a solid grip on it. He started by slowly adding more of his weight on it until he was sure it would hold him. With a leap of faith, he jumped and let his feet fall below him while his hands were still fixed to the ends of the peg. To his surprise, his feet discovered another peg below him, upon which he found more secure footing and carefully stooped down to. He performed the same steps on the next peg and his feet found a layer of dust thick enough to cushion his feet before they hit the cold hard ground. In the distance, he could still see the remnants of Ramne's blue light and the shadow of his feet touching the floor with every step.
-->

    He glanced at where he had seen Ramne before to find nothing but the dark and then reassured hae one more time with a hand squeeze before running back toward the pegs and the hole he entered from. Inside, Fanla and Penyi were busy fetching weapons and passing them under the cloth wall.

    "Fanla? Penyi? Where did you go? We've been waiting for you," he whispered loudly.

    Fanla replied, "We hid because someone came in looking for us."

    He hasitated for a moment and then regained his train of thought.

    "I need a hot tip, have you seen one?"

    Fanla approached him and didn't seem to have heard what he requested, "What have you been doing down there? Linyu has been going crazy on the listener."

    *Why didn't I hear him?*

    "What do you mean?"

    "Thi saw some figures running from the pavilion and is certain one of them was Casra."

    "Dammit."

    "Well shouldn't you go after them?"

    "I can't do that right now. Ginnu is down here and thi fell pretty hard. I need a hot tip to cauterize a wound."

    She gasped and then darted to a corner of the room where she picked up a pouch and immediately handed them to Kipnu who immediately noticed the pouch was still warm. She said, "I saw a vial of Kanosin and a hot tip in this bag."

    Before he could turn back around, she asked him, "What should I tell the others?"

    "Tell them to stay hidden and Find Setre. Tell her what you told me."

    "Got it," she said and darted off.

    From afar he could hear faint sounds of dust shifting quickly on the ground. As he grew nearer his fears were escalated when he realized Ginnu was having a seizure.






    He glanced at the wound and saw that the swelling had come down but blood was still draining out steadily.

    *Thi's bleeding from an artery under the broken bone.*

    He opened the pouch that Fanla had given him and used his fingers to examine its contents. *syringe, kanosin ampule...A hot tip* He pulled the hot tip out and examined the charred point. *Looks like it's still got some life*.

    He took one more observation of hae vitals while repeatedly pressing the plunger to warm it up, "convulsions; pulse fast; pressure high; temperature high."


    He moved the hot tip toward the incision he had made, but either through reflex or alertness, Kipnu stopped and jumped off of Ginnu and away from an arm trying to grab him out of the darkness. It was Ramne, by the looks of his markings, pacing toward him.

    "Who're you?! What are you doing with Ginnu?!" Ramne demanded.

    Kipnu took a defensive stance and held the blade tightly in the light so Ramne could see.

    "I need to help hae," Kipnu asserted.

    "You're that doctor that ran off, aren't you? I know better than to bid on arrogant pricks like you. The fuck are you doing down here?"

    Kipnu didn't respond, but held his stance and his look of disdain.

    "Oh I get it. You're the hero come to the rescue. Well you're about a lifetime too late."

    "Please, I need to help hae."

    He snickered under his gritty breath and took a few steps closer, kicking Ginnu's sprawled lifeless leg out of the way. Kipnu could see that Ramne was on a stiff dose of Kanosin. He quickly glanced at Ginnu and saw the blood still trickling out of the wound, but didn't dare take his eyes off of Ramne.

    Ramne said, "Thi's mine. But I don't give a shit about hae. You think thi's different than anyone else here? You think either of hae hearts still cares about right and wrong? If it weren't her out there keeping the world full of Kano, someone else would be doing it."

    "Look, I'm not here to argue. Ginnu needs help or thi'll die."

    "Thi's already gone. What the fuck does thi care?"

    He glanced at hae again to check his statement. Blood continued to drip out of the wound, and the convulsions were slowing.

    Ramne continued, "You think you know what happened here, don't you, Kipnu. Everybody took Casra' good nature and then stabbed hae in the back with it. We told hae to fight back, but instead thi fled into the dark forest with hae kaln. Thi chose to abandon everyone while Setre and I tried to save it from burning to the ground."

    Ramne leaned over Ginnu, his chest above haes with his palms on his knees. He took a closer look at Kipnu in the light of his decorated body.

    He said, "You might think yourself a noble man. But that means nothing here. Ulukoma is shit. You dominate everything you can. And then you die."

    Kipnu met his gaze with conviction in his eyes. "When Ara fades from the sky and you've killed off everyone you had a chance to love, I hope you find the decency to regret it all as you die alone in the dark."

    He chuckled a quick breath, barely a puff, and told him, "Nobody dies in the dark."

    Rising to his right, he turned and stared comfortably into the void as if speaking to an invisible friend.

    "You know what, Kipnu, I like you. Let's make a deal, I'll let you live at the end of all this and you can stay here to be my personal servant."

But the addicts and criminals of the world are lazy and wicked; their contributions must be taken from them by force.

    "Get the fuck out of here."

    "Just think about it. This'll be the only place left when the darkness falls and you mainlanders kill each other in the chaos."

    Kipnu walked closer to challenge him and said, "We aren't like you!"

    Ramne smirked in his face and said, "Not yet."

    Ramne backed away slowly from Kipnu, their eyes fixated on each other, and then he turned to fade into the infinite abyss.

    Without pause, Kipnu once again dropped to Ginnu and took an observation, "Unconscious; pulse high; pressure high; temperature still high; breathing...stopped"

    "Dammit, Ramne," he said under his breath.

    He scrambled to find the hot tip in the dust and caught it with a finger. From a satchel at his waist, he produced some kelp collagen Casra had given him, and applied it to the wound. She said it would melt over a wound, but he wasn't sure if it would do the trick with one so big and full of blood. Without being able to see the wound, he imagined the vasculature system in the area, as he was trained to do. He positioned the hot tip and melted the collagen over the artery exactly where the fractured skull piece would have punctured it. The cauterizing procedure was nearly instant; he had been rehearsing it in his head while talking to Ramne.

    *Kanosin reduces blood pressure.* He reached back into the pouch with his bloody fingers and produced the syringe and ampule. It took only a few presses to warm the hot tip enough to sanitize the needle. He punctured the wax seal of the ampule with the syringe, and set the puncture lever to let the translucent blue liquid enter the needle. *It's ready.* He pulled hae shirt down to expose hae chest and plunged the kanosin into it over one of hae hearts. Glowing blue streaks radiated underneath hae pallid skin as they had for Kipnu a single night ago. Hae eyes gazed forward and inward, sitting lifeless in their cradles where they had been alive moments ago. Kipnu watched as they dilated ever so slightly, but didn't move.

    He checked her vitals again, "Unconscious. Temperature lower. Pulse...No no no!"

    He slipped behind her as he had for Linyu and began to compress hae hearts. No response. *Thi lost too much blood. I need to transfuse.*

    The syringe showed some signs of dulling but he carried on, plunging it into his own arm to fill the barrel with blood. No time was wasted to clot the wound he just produced in his arm; he found a vein in hae arm, narrow and empty with blood loss, and painstakingly located it with the needle to fill it with the new contents of the syringe. Hae shirt became a dressing for the now-cauterized wound while he once again assumed his position behind hae, trying desparately to restart hae hearts.

    "You will not die on me. Not today," he said into hae unhearing ear.

    "Kipnu!" He heard Fanla's voice calling from above.

    "Not now!"

    "The Pavilion is on fire!"

    "I said not now!" he said, tuning her out.

    He moved out from under Ginnu and picked up the needle again, jabbing it into the same wound, yelling in pain and frustration. He removed the bloody dressing and found the narrow vessel again. Her question weighed on him heavily. *"Am I dying?"* He heard it echo in his mind as he crawled back under her and counted his compressions on her hearts.

	"Tell me, Kipnu um Heiko: Why would a magistrate send a doctor to Ulukoma in the midst of a global crisis? Do you really think he values justice over sensibility?"

	"How do you know about that?"

	"Oh, everybody has a debt to pay. Sometimes an... arrangement can be made for those who would rather pay in power."

	"People like you bring nothing but misery to the world. You make me sick."
