## Chapter 14


	Kip paused the group in their walk toward the Shadestead, smelling the first hints of fire in the air. He turned around and signaled to them to gather in close to him.

	"From this point on, Linyu and I will be guiding you from above, so I want to go over a few things. What you see and what we see may not be the same, so use your own judgment and decide what's best. Stay with your partners at all times; if one of them is hurt, make sure that the area is safe and get out. If they have a listener, take it off of them and put it on yourself. If any one of Lissa's guardians gets a hold of one we could all be captured, so do not let this happen. And finally, Do Not Kill; I repeat Do Not Kill unless they are endangering your life or your partner's life. Setre will be there and she cannot be harmed. Everyone clear?"

	"Yea," the said in a broken unison.

	"Voices off, everyone clear?"

	They nodded in a much clearer unison.

	"Stay here until you hear me through your listeners. I'll join you once the you begin. Good luck, everyone."

	He put his arm around Lin and said, "Lead the way." Lin took him through the forest, ever closer to the fire until they came upon an old tree that was leaning due to shifting clay in the ground.

	"This one," thi said, already starting to climb.

	Kip was concerned, "Is there a closer tree?"

	"This is the tree you start on. We can travel between trees once we get up above."

	He looked up into the dark abyss, and put his full trust in Linyu. They tied a rope to each other, one to the transmitter, and another long one for rappeling back down, and began the climb up the tree. They were relying on the lean of the tree to support their weight on each vault to the next position. With such a large tree, Kip was struggling to wrap his legs in a way that would secure him, but he watched as Linyu focused on scaling it with hae feet in the various crevasses that formed out of the bark.

	"Wait up, Linyu," he said, feeling an upward tug on the rope.

	"Sorry, Kipnu."

	Nearing the top, Kip could see branches, which served as nice places to rest, and the beginning of a canopy, with hints of Ara at the top.

	"Why is it so bright up here?"

	"These trees are so tall so their leaves can reach Ara's light."

	"How do you mean?"

	"You'll see."

	When they reached an area with several smaller branches, they could see clear rays of red light peering between the densely-packed thin leaves dancing with the wind above. Lin led him along one of them so they could reach the end and peek their heads above the canopy. The light of Ara beamed straight into his eyes, and he had to shield them for a moment.

	"Why is it so bright up here?"

	"When you've been in the dark for so long, the light can seem painful."

	He finally opened his eyes, and was amazed at what he saw. Shaki Bay, with Ara in a gradient from dark to light. The Shaki Mountains, the Northern one out of which the city was carved. And the lines of houses and farms, mere specks on the land that formed a geometric pattern as natural as Ara itself.

	"Absolutely beautiful," he said. Linyu remained quiet, remembering all the times hae mother brought hae there. Kip secured his footing and turned around to look toward Ulu. Through the darkness, Kip could see cloud cover for at least as far as he could see, which was only about the length of the island. But if he stared long enough, he could see tiny specks of faint red and infrared hanging in the sky.

  "Linyu, what are those red dots?" he asked, pointing toward the horizon.

  "Don't know. Mom calls them Ara's children. They're always right above the clouds when Ara is far away."

  "And they've always been there?"

  "Always."

  Kip was transfixed on them, wondering why he had never seen them on the mainland. but he snapped out of his temporary obsession, remembering that they still had a job to do.

  "Well, shall we move a bit closer?" He asked.

  "Can I ask you something first?"

  He hesitated, "Well, sure."

  "Once this ends, and you go back to your home on the mainland. Don't forget about us."

  Hae doubtful eyes peered into a part of himself he had long forgotten. As if Linyu was directing Kip's subconscious, and he himself was just a passenger.

  "I could never forget about you, Linyu. Or your mother, or your nather. I will find a way to clear Ara and I'll come back to tell you all the stories."

  "That's what every outsider says to the people they meet while they're here. They never come back."

  Kip felt a tear well up without surfacing. He wanted to say *I'm not whoever disappointed you. I mean the things that I say*. But instead he cracked a small smile to cover up his sadness and said, "No excuses, no mistakes. You have my word."

  But Linyu didn't smile; thi gathered hae things and climbed across the canopy, toward the clearing where the great fire burned brightly in the darkness below.

	They reached the base of a long thick branch that jutted its way into the opening, and Linyu found a coil wrapped around a smaller branch that grew out of it. Kip pulled up the battery and wrapped the slack rope in a simple knot around the smaller branch while Linyu twisted wires from the transmitter box to the coil ends. One-by-one, Linyu checked all of the connections and oriented the long face of the box toward the ground. Kip pulled a listener out of a satchel he was carrying and held it to his ear as an eager Linyu positioned haeself to speak into the transmitter.

	Thi spoke into the transmitter with anticipation, "If you can hear this, we're ready to go," and then laughed at Kip who had pulled it away from his ear because it was so loud.

	"It's louder, the closer you are," thi said.

	"Yea, I figured that out!" he exclaimed, putting the listener back into his satchel. The two looked over the big branch onto the Shadestead, making mental maps of the terrain and feeling the warm smoky currents from the fire mix with the wind. They counted seven blue lights from guardians scattered around the fire. Two of them were sparring with sticks near the kitchen and the others were eating a late dinner closer to the armory.

	Kip moved to the transmitter and said, "Seven guardians around the fire. Five near the armory. Approach from the East, everyone. Approach from the East."

	Linyu pointed to the south as the first signs of movement came from their group, moving in a line toward the Shadestead and shifting their movement to the East. *Setre's plan is working!*, he whispered.

	Their view of the armory was slightly obscured, but they watched as the group circled around it from the back.

	He noticed one of the eating guardians look to the side, and he quickly said, "Stop! Stop!" into the transmitter. They did, and the guardian went back to eating.

	"Walk slower and spread out," he said. And they watched as the group followed his orders. Once they reached the back side of the armory, Kip addressed the most agile maman in the group, "Penyi, go in and survey the place. The rest of you, sit tight and get your bearings." Kip kept his eyes on the guardians, watching every move and thinking of contingencies in case they did catch on. Moments stretched longer and longer until Kip began to feel uneasy about the time it was taking to search a tent so small.

	He asked Linyu, "What do you think is taking hae so long?"

	Thi shrugged and kept watching the scene, but Kip was getting impatient.

	"I'm going down there"

	"But I need you up here," thi said.

	"You'll be fine. It's just calling out things you see."

	"But-"

	He unwrapped the rope from Linyu and looped it around the first branch

	"I'll be right back," he said.

	"Kip!"

	But he was off, heading down the tree before thi could stop him.

	Back on the ground, Kip took the rope off and followed the pathway the group had taken as quickly and quietly as they had. Nearing the group, he saw their listeners and remembered to put his own on.

  "Hey, what's going on?" he asked them at a whisper.

  A maman told him, "Not sure. Penyi went in, then... nothing."

  "I'm going in. Someone come with me to be a messenger in case something goes wrong."

  "I'll go," whispered a woman. She came forward on all fours to quiet her movements, introducing herself, "I am Fanla, a tracker from Heiko."

  She was young, likely the kind who had come to Ulukoma on a whim. But fear was not apparent in her expressions - only excitement.

  "Ok Fanla. Follow a few paces behind me. If I get hit, you run, got it?"

  "Got it," She said.

  They tiptoed toward the armory tent, and Kip peeked underneath the cloth on the ground. He saw nothing but racks full of spears and a faint blue light from a bottle at the top of the tent. He slipped underneath with minimal effort and slowly stood up as he continued to look around. His ears listening for any sign of trouble from the fire or from Lin, he began surveying the tent a little closer than he had before. All was blue and still, with no sign of Penyi. *Thi didn't just vanish*. He took up a spear and with one last glance at the room, signaled under the wall for Fanla to come in.

  They both slowly walked around the room, looking at the weapons that were stockpiled - daggers, spears, swords, bows and arrows. All hardened and sharpened to an infinitesimal edge.

	"Hey, look at this," Fanla beckoned from another side of the tent.

	Kip shot a glance toward her feet where a small wooden door lay among the thin damp leaves. Its polished hardware was too precise to be made in Ulukoma, but its messy grease and handle reminded them of where they were.

	"Maybe this is where Penyi went," she said.

	"Maybe," he said, taking up two daggers and handing one to Penyi. Her hands took the dagger as she looked up with concern for Kipnu, but he could do nothing to quell it - he had to find Fanla. Kip kneeled down at the edge of the hole and with an imperceptible creak, he swung the door open to uncover a tunnel big enough for two leading into the darkness.

	"I'll go down," he said. "Start bringing people in one-by-one. If you hear any trouble, bring some people and come get me."

	"Got it," she said.

	With his hands against the wall, Kip made his way into the tunnel with only the blue light on his chest to light his way. After only a few steps, he came upon a sharp descent in the ground and he could no longer see a reflection of the blue light against anything in front of him. *A room. Dug into the ground like Shaki*, he thought. He sat down on the edge to try and feel for where the ground was in front of him, but he stopped when he heard the sound of footsteps on dust from far away in front of him. He covered his marking with his right arm and readied his dagger in the other while watching as the mysterious person came closer. They stopped immediately below him, several strides down and removed their shirt to reveal the bright blue markings of a guardian. The light bounced off of the ground and illuminated the face of Ramne, looking at a body lying on the floor in front of him.

	He murmured to himself, "Now who might you be?"

	He reached for an arm and picked the body up. It was a maman. *Penyi. You must have fallen.*. Once Ramne was far enough away, Kip put the dagger in his pouch and started his search for the ground again, slowly swinging his leg off the ledge. On the third swing, he broadened his swing, and his toe hit a steel peg, causing him to wince and fight every urge to scream. He took a moment to regain his calm and proceeded to move his hands to the peg. It was grooved in a peculiar way and the bottom was covered with a thick layer of rust, but after a few swipes he was sure he could get a solid grip on it. He started by slowly adding more of his weight on it until he was sure it would hold him. With a leap of faith, he jumped and let his feet fall below him while his hands were still fixed to the ends of the peg. To his surprise, his feet discovered another peg below him, upon which he found more secure footing and carefully stooped down to. He performed the same steps on the next peg and his feet found the ground - a desert of grit and dust. In the distance, he could still see the remnants of Ramne's blue light and the shadow of Penyi on his shoulder. *I can catch up*. He rubbed his toe to ease the pain and redistribute the water in his skin, and then took off after Ramne. With every silent step, the gap between them was closing, and the light of Ramne's chest grew brighter. The anticipation of a fight grew in him. *A man like that deserves what's coming to him*. When Kip had come within ten paces, Ramne stopped and turned in suspicion, but he was too late to fend off any sort of attack. Instead he threw Penyi at him and ran a few paces forward to keep the distance between himself and his would-be assailant.

	"Who're you? How'd you get down here?"

	Kip dropped the dagger briefly to catch Penyi and lay hae down as quickly and gently as he could. He reached for the dagger, but couldn't find it anywhere. Out of options, he turned toward Ramne and took a defensive stance.

	"Kip?! Well dammit, I thought you'd never come," he said.

	Kip didn't respond, but held his stance and his look of disdain.

	"Oh I get it. You're the hero come to rescue the weak. Bout time you woke up, man. No heroes here; just kanoheads. Selfish, miserable, fucked-up kanoheads."

	"*You* made them that way. You don't have to keep doing this."

	He snickered under his gritty breath and took a few steps closer, letting the toe of his hard reed boot shove into Penyi's lifeless shoulder. Kip didn't budge.

	Ramne said, "You think I'm any different than anyone else here? You think one of my hearts still cares about right and wrong? If it weren't me out there keeping the world full of Kano, someone else would be there to fill my shoes. I'd rather be the one reaping the benefits. Doesn't bother me one bit how it comes."

	"And what would Linyu think about it?"

	"Why the hell would I–"

	His tone turned remained uncaring.

	"You don't know what happened here, Kip. Everybody took Cas' good nature and then stabbed hae in the back with it. We told hae to fight back, but instead thi fled into the dark forest with hae kaln. They chose to abandon everyone while Set and I tried to save it from burning to the ground."

	Ramne leaned over Penyi and Kip, holding his chest above them with his palms on his knees. He took a closer look at Kip in the light of his decorated chest.

	He said, "You might think yourself a noble man. But that means nothing here. Ulukoma is shit. You dominate everything you can, and then you die."

	Kip met his gaze with conviction in his eyes. "When Ara fades from the sky and Lissa has killed off everyone you had a chance to love, I hope you find the decency to regret it all as you die alone in the dark."

	He laughed, "Hah. Lissa? All hae power is a show to keep the harvesters obedient. Thi wouldn't hurt a thing without hae master saying so."

	"And who is that?"

	He raised up and turned toward the darkness as if speaking to an invisible friend.

	"Tell me, Doctor Kipnu um Heiko: Why would a magistrate send a doctor to Ulukoma in the midst of a global crisis? Do you really think he values justice over sensibility?"

	"How do you know about that?"

	"Oh, everybody has a debt to pay. Sometimes an... arrangement can be made for those who would rather pay in power." He smiled and paused to change the subject. "You know what, Kip, I like you. Let's make a deal, I'll let you live at the end of all this and you can stay here to be my personal servant."

	"Go to hell."

	"Just think about it. This'll be the only place left when the darkness falls and you mainlanders kill each other in the chaos."

	Kip stood up to challenge him and said, "We aren't like you!"

	Ramne smirked and stood up to face him again.

	"Not yet," he said.

	Ramne backed away slowly from Kip, their eyes fixated on each other, and then he turned to fade into the infinite abyss.

	Once he was sure that Ramne was gone, Kip looked back down Penyi and felt for hae pulse. *Still ticking*. Thi began to stir and moan, and Kip immediately turned his focus to hae.

	"Stay still, don't move," Kipnu told a barely-conscious Penyi. He could see bad scrapes and bruises on hae shoulder and on the side of hae head.

	"How is your head? Does it hurt?" he asked has he gently touched the wound.

	"Ahhhh." Thi groaned.

	"Ok. I can work with that."

	He took off his pouch and gently raised Penyi's head and shoulders much to hae protest. With graceful and deliberate touches, he checked how bad the head injury and found that a piece of hae skull had fractured underneath.

	"UNNHNN!" Thi yelled in pain.

	*Shit*

	He scrambled to look for the dagger he had dropped, but couldn't find it anywhere. *Ramne...He must have picked it up.*

	"I'll be right back," he said.

	"Unnhhhh!!" Thi exclaimed. *Brain damage.*

	He slid his bag under hae head and reassured hae one more time before ran back toward the pegs and the hole he entered from.

	He whispered loudly from the opening, "Fanla, hand me a knife."

	She was in the middle of passing daggers under the tent, but she came back to the hole and whispered, "What have you been doing down there? Linyu has been going crazy on the listener."

	*Why didn't I hear hae?*

	"What do you mean?"

	"Thi saw some figures running from the tent and is certain one of them was Casra."

	"Dammit."

	"Well shouldn't you go after them?"

	"It's Penyi... Thi's fallen pretty badly. I need to make an incision."

	She gasped and then darted to a corner of the tent where she picked up a dagger and a pouch.

	She immediately handed them to Kipnu and said, "There's Kanosin in there. For the pain."

	Before he could turn back around, she asked him, "What should I tell the others?"

	"Tell them to stay hidden and Find Setre. Tell her what you told me. She'll know what to do."

	"Got it," she said and darted off.

	From afar he could hear faint sounds of dust shifting quickly on the ground. As he grew nearer his fears were escalated when he realized Penyi was beginning convulsions.

	"No no that's too soon!"

	He sprinted in the dark toward the sounds and straddled hae braced hae head with his right arm.

	"Fanla!" He yelled for her, but she couldn't hear.

	He held the knife in his left hand and with a quick flick, he cut open a small hole under the scrape on hae temple. A mix of blood, dermal fluid, and cerebral fluid formed a rivulet in the dust while Kip put the knife far away and continued to monitor hae pulse.

	"Nystagmus; pulse fast; temperature high; breathing irregular," he said aloud as he had been trained to do.

	"Come On!" He yelled.

	He glanced at the wound and saw that the swelling had come down but blood was still coming out of the wound.

	*Thi will lose too much blood if I don't bring hae pulse down... Kanosin?*

	He opened the pouch that Fanla had given him and used his fingers to examined its contents. *Pipe...Kanosin Flowers...A hot tip* He pulled the hot tip out and examined the charred point. *Looks like it's still got some life*.

	He took one more observation of hae vitals while repeatedly pressing the plunger to warm it up, "convulsions stopped; unconscious; pulse fast; pressure high; temperature normalized; breathing normalized," and then removed the pipe and a kanosin flower for preparation.

	*I can't believe I'm doing this.* He finished the pipe and then topped off the hot tip again and placed it firmly against the dried pistils of the flower. They danced and shriveled away from the heat and then started to form embers.

	"Here goes," he said out loud, and proceeded to inhale the Kanosin. He took a moderately sized inhale and quickly stopped closer to Penyi to breathe it into hae mouth during inhale. Thi didn't respond. Kip took another drag from the pipe and breathed it into hae mouth, and this time thi shriveled hae face and started to cough lightly.

	"Penyi!" He laughed, but then remembered that he couldn't stop yet.

	He warmed up the hot tip again and moved it toward the incision he had made to relieve the pressure on hae brain. With three gentle presses he cauterized the wound while Penyi made wincing faces but took the pain.

	Kip once again took an observation, "Conscious; pulse normalizing; pressure normalizing; temperature normal; breathing... coughing. Welcome back, Penyi."

	Thi opened hae eyes the slightest bit like two doors slightly ajar with a blue light seeping through.

	"Hey Penyi, can you hear me?"

	Penyi tried to nod, but winced in pain and moved hae arm toward the wound on hae head. Kip gently pressed hae shoulder, glad that thi could still move.

	He asked hae some questions to get hae reoriented, "Do you know who I am?"

	Thi looked at him with determined eyes, but did not say a word.

	"Can you speak?"

	Hae let out a breathing whimper, and his heart sank for hae.

	"Penyi, you've suffered some memory loss, so you might not be able to remember certain things. You will eventually re-learn them. For now you are safe and you should do what you can to rest."

	Thi took his hand into hae own and managed to make what Kip interpreted to be smile.

	"A smile already? You're a fighter," he said.

	*Need to get moving*

	"I have to go, ok?" Thi made a concerned look and breathed heavily as if to speak, but only a punctuated breath took the air.

	"It's ok. I'll send a couple others down here to look after you and bring you some water. Just rest for now."

	Thi brought haeself to trust his plan and then loosened hae grip on his hand. Slowly, he stood up with hae hands still wrapped around his own, feeling a strange connection with this maman.

	"I'll come back for you after. I promise," he said longingly, and then turned back to face the direction of Fanla and the others. He spotted some mild hallucinations in the dark, and his emotions were rapidly waxing and waning. "Must be the Kanosin," he said to himself, and kept going.

	On the way up the strange pegs, he caught the faint odors of wood and kanosin smoke hanging in the air. Far away, he could hear a low rumble, constant and unhuman. *Fire? What's going on?* In the armory, the rumble had grown to a deep roar coming from the direction of the main tent with hints of yells and hollers trickling through. There was no sign of Fanla and spears were strewn on the ground as if in a hurry.

	"Fanla?" He called, trying to find her. All he heard was the commotion outside. He took a spear and moved to a small crack in the entryway. He unsheathed an eye upon the scene outside and felt the heat of the firelight land upon his cheek. Some people were rushing out of the tent carrying limp bodies. Others were carrying crates of kanosin. Most were standing at a safe distance from the tent staring in horror at the sight of their home burning down. Adjacent to the armory, he saw a group of bodies laying on the ground and some people from his group attending to them. Some of them were stirring, and others were not. In an instant, he dropped the spear and ran out to help.

	"Fanla!" He shouted when he approached them, and they quickly glanced in his direction.

	Fanla franticly waved to him and called out, "Kip, these people aren't breathing. What do we do?"

	He rushed toward her and knealt over the body of the maman she was attending to. He checked hae hearts for a pulse, finding one of two and pushed on hae lungs from above.

	He announced to them, "If they have a pulse, do this until they cough. If they don't, move on to the next person."

	They all quickly moved to someone, doing as he told them and repeating his motions. He turned to the woman and asked, "Where is Setre?"

	"She's been moving people in and out of the fire."

	Without a pause, he rose and ran off. The heat grew in intensity as he approached, but he pushed the pain down. He had to find Setre and Casra.

	A silhouette appeared in the doorway of the tent. It was thin and short, almost resembling "Linyu! Linyu is that you? What are you doing down here?" But amidst the lapping of flames and fabric, the silhouette stood up and transformed into Casra, stumbling out of the tent in a daze. He dashed to her to pull her out of the flames.

	"Lin...Lin...", she mumbled through labored breaths as she collapsed onto the ground.

	He was too busy lifting and carrying her to hear what she had said. When he had made it to the area where Fanla and the others were checking for survivors, he set her down gently and began examining her for injury. The entire left side of her head and neck had been disfigured by the flames. Setre reached to Kip's arm and he turned back toward her. Her eyes were glazed and vacant as if she were experiencing some other world between her eyes and his. She called out again in a voice frailer than before, "Kip... Lin..."

	"Thi is safe in the treetops. No need to worry," he comforted her. But her mind was still locked away.

	*I need to find Casra.*

	"Fanla, which direction did Linyu see the figures run?"

	"Figures?" she asked franticly. Her hands were firmly against the chest of a fallen guardian, searching for a pulse.

	"You told me that Linyu was going mad about some figures."

	"Ulu. They ran toward Ulu," she said in a hurried tone.

	"I'm going after them. Take care of Setre and Penyi."

	Fanla, incredulous, averted her focus, "Where are you going?! We need you here!"

	"You'll be fine!"

	Kip ran into the darkness, exhausted but resolute in his duty to save Casra.

	The trees were transforming from giant pillars of reflected fire to silent phantoms looming in the dark, discovered only by the sudden absence of echoes. He searched for any faint sign of a horizon through the darkness, but none was visible.











	<!-- Linyu Death Scene Below -->

	 *This fucking pipe!* He pounded the ground beneath him and the sound fell dead in the vast emptiness of this strange room. As hae breaths slowed down and hae heartbeat slowed, Kip sat with his fingers on hae wrist and resigned his role of hero, of doctor - just for now - and recalled the steps that had gotten him this far. How little he really knew about the maman he sent to hae death, or about the place they were currently in. He reached into the pouch again and produced a Kanosin flower that he held out in front of him. In the blue light of his tattoo he could see its tender white petals and fuzzy central dome of pollen.

	<!-- Either Penyi dies only, or Penyi and Linyu die -->
	<!-- Maybe just Penyi. Linyu might be an interesting Protag next book -->

	"What terrors blossom from such an innocent thing. A life is lost because of you today, flower of the night. But oh the more tempting do you become to those who know loss. And thus is your survival ensured."

	He muddled the flower in the pipe, lit it with the phosphor, and took a moment to contemplate smoking it. In his grieving stupor, he took the pipe to his mouth, but the taste of the sweet smoke reminded him of Lissa and the Shadestead and of all the messed up things he had promised to stop. Instead, he put the pipe on Linyu's chest, in hopes that it would lift hae spirit away from this dark and lonely place. If such thing existed, it would be worth it, he thought.
