## Chapter 17


  One gatekeeper stood vigil at the end of the bridge, bundled up in thick black cloth underneath a shining steel gorget with a rise to protect her neck from the sides and an etching of the Yanshan symbol of a ship on the broad front plate. The skeletal features of her face showed that she was of an older age than most keepers would have been but clearly still fit for her duties.

  "Well look who it is," she scoffed as the group approached her, "The traitor and the liar. Quite the band of thieves you make."

  Pomri responded, "Such a warm welcome, Bavle."

  "Oh, pardon my manners," she said facetiously, "Perhaps you'd like to be thrown across the rails first."

  "Perhaps you'd like this spear down your throat."

  Melna glanced to the side and whispered, "Pomri, what's this about?"

  But Bavle continued, "So tell me why I should let you bastards through."

  A lull in the conversation formed while Melna watched their eyes turn in her direction and stuttered to begin, "W-we are on our way to a senate session. We would like to pass."

  "No," said the guard.

  "What? Why?"

  "Well you haven't told me the password."

  Melna paused, trying to understand such a ridiculous requirement. *A password? Since when was there a password to enter Rudjan?*. She thought and thought for an awkward moment that had long overstayed its welcome, when all of a sudden she heard a chuckle coming from Pomri, and then Bavle, and then all out laughing from the two.

  "I didn't think she'd fall for that!" yelled Pomri. "A password?! Really, Melna?"

  Bavle joined her, "Is your senator honestly so dull?"

  Melna was unamused at being the brunt of a joke, not to mention the waste of precious time, but she took it in stride.

  "Ok, very funny," she said. "We have a train to catch, so please let us be on our way."

  Bavle couldn't stop laughing, but moved to a hidden panel in the wall and with an effortless flick of the finger, she activated a switch to the gate motors.

  "Oh I've missed your damn face, Pomri. Come back when the obscura are gone."

  "I will. Just gotta save the world first."

  "Just another day for Pomri."

  Pomri's saffa went in first, and Bavle stopped Melna's saffa.

  "Now you two, keep a watchful eye. All sorts of trouble is brewing lately."

  "Thank you for letting us know. We'll remain vigilant while we're here," she responded with an unmistakeable kind of sincerity. A curiosity pulled her focus toward the woman's clothes, catching a glimpse of a healing wound on her chest.

  "Bavle," she asked passing while underneath the gate. Will you be okay?" she asked, careful to avoid making her uncomfortable.
  
  Bavle chortled and quickly pulled her clothing tighter around her chest, "Yes we'll be okay. It takes more than a bit of cold to make the Rudjanese quiver."

  Melna bowed in respect and implored Linyu to do so while they bid farewell to the keeper who had already turned to close the gate. They passed through two sets of the giant iron gates and immediately entered onto a pier of a bustling market of small ships lit by oil lanterns bobbing to and fro from their latch points on each end of the bows and sterns.

  "Rudjan is locked to travel," an elderly guard told them at the gate into the city.

  "I am a Heiko senator passing through to Shaki. Please let us pass," Melna told him.

  "My apologies, žah, I cannot even open the gate. You'll have to find a way around."

  Pomri interjected, "That's crazy. We need to board the train."
Rudjan
  "I've told you all I know," said the guard.

  Melna held Linyu steady and jumped off of Laen-Laen's back to approach the guard while Pomri remained mounted.

  She asked him, "Can you ask anyone to open the gate?"

  "I'm locked out of the city until I am relieved from my shift at mid-day."

  "Rudjan has never been this tightly locked. What is the reason?" Pomri demanded.

  "There is no more food or space to support refugees. We cannot risk taking in a single person as it would mean risking the lives of all our citizens."

  Pomri was visibly angry now. "This is ridiculous. Whose law is this?"

  "Our senators told us this was a decree that the entire senate has made."

  "If the senate had agreed on such a rule, I would have known," said Melna.

  "I don't know what to tell you, žah."

  Melna began to pace slowly, frustrated but holding steady on a more pensive state of mind. She pondered busting through the gate somehow, but ruled out the bending of thick steel bars as a matter of time.

  She turned to Pomri and asked, "What if we went the other way?"

  "What other way?"

  "You said the only way is through the desert. What about the ocean?"

  "The ocean is dangeorus without light or wind. If the vessel unhooks from the rail, we could be drifting out into the darkness."

  "Ah. I see," she said. She turned around to the guard and asked him, "Excuse me, do you know of a good ship and captain we could hire?"

  "Toward Shaki? There aren't many fishers who know that route."

  "Any ship will do, as long as we can trust the captain."

  "The only ships like that go to Ulukoma first. Check the far dock."

  "Thank you sir."

  "Oh and uh..." He hesitated. "There's a captain named Ramne who runs a ship that way. I wouldn't trust him."

  Linyu whimpered in fear at his name, drawing Pomri's attention.

  "Eh? What's gotten into you?" she asked.

  Thi was getting ready to jump off of Laen-Laen and run, but Melna had already become aware of hae and leapt back to hae.

  "Hey, Linyu. What's wrong?" asked Melna, holding onto hae arms.

  "Ramne," thi said in a cracked voice, "He..."

  Tears were forming at the corners of hae eyes.

  "What did he do?"

  "Mom," thi said, at the end of hae wit.

  "I take it you're not a boat person. Well, we can't go back now so you're either coming with us or you're on your own again."

  Thi took a moment, feeling angry at the predicament thi was put into. There was nowhere to run, standing outside a massive city barred from entry, and Laen-Laen, who could take hae anywhere if anywhere were safe anymore. Thi placed hae hand on Kip's pendant under hae shirt and closed hae eyes in thought.

  "Together," thi whispered. Pomri smiled at hae courage.

  "One night is all I ask," Said the fisherwoman, chiding a starving maman.

  "For a fish?"
