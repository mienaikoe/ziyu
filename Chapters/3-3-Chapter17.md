## Chapter 17


  One gatekeeper stood vigil at the end of the bridge, bundled up in thick black cloth underneath a shining steel gorget with a rise to protect her neck from the sides and an etching of the Yanshan symbol of a ship on the broad front plate. The skeletal features of her face showed that she was of an older age than most keepers would have been but clearly still fit for her duties.

  "Well look who it is," she scoffed as the group approached her, "The traitor and the liar. Quite the band of thieves you make."

  Pomri responded, "Such a warm welcome, Bavle."

  "Oh, pardon my manners," she said facetiously, "Perhaps you'd like to be thrown across the rails first."

  "Perhaps you'd like this spear down your throat."

  Melna glanced to the side and whispered, "Pomri, what's this about?"

  But Bavle continued, "So tell me why I should let you bastards through."

  A lull in the conversation formed while Melna watched their eyes turn in her direction and stuttered to begin, "W-we are on our way to a senate session. We would like to pass."

  "No," said the guard.

  "What? Why?"

  "Well you haven't told me the password."

  Melna paused, trying to understand such a ridiculous requirement. *A password? Since when was there a password to enter Rudjan?*. She thought and thought for an awkward moment that had long overstayed its welcome, when all of a sudden she heard a chuckle coming from Pomri, and then Bavle, and then all out laughing from the two.

  "I didn't think she'd fall for that!" yelled Pomri. "A password?! Really, Melna?"

  Bavle joined her, "Is your senator honestly so dull?"

  Melna was unamused at being the brunt of a joke, not to mention the waste of precious time, but she took it in stride.

  "Ok, very funny," she said. "We have a train to catch, so please let us be on our way."

  Bavle couldn't stop laughing, but moved to a hidden panel in the wall and with an effortless flick of the finger, she activated a switch to the gate motors.

  "Oh I've missed your damn face, Pomri. Come back when the obscura are gone."

  "I will. Just gotta save the world first."

  "Just another day for Pomri."

  Pomri's saffa went in first, and Bavle stopped Melna's saffa.

  "Now you two, keep a watchful eye. All sorts of trouble is brewing lately."

  "Thank you for letting us know. We'll be vigilant," she responded with an unmistakeable kind of sincerity. Her curious eye pulled her focus toward the woman's clothes, catching a glimpse of a healing wound on her chest.

  "Bavle," she asked passing while underneath the gate. "Will you be okay?"
  
  Bavle chortled and quickly pulled her clothing tighter around her chest, "Yes I'll be okay. It takes more than a bit of cold to make the Rudjanese quiver."

  Melna bowed in respect and implored Linyu to do so while they bid farewell to the keeper who had already turned to close the gate. They passed through two sets of the giant iron gates and immediately entered onto the pier of a bustling market full of merchants on small ships. Their bows curled into large arcs and narrowed to a pillar to hold bobbing brass oil lanterns at their ends. To Melna they looked like some sort of firebreathing spirits of the sea, come to join with Rudjanese society.
  
  By the time Melna had caught up to Pomri, she had already got off of her saffa and bought some grilled shellfish on a stick to eat. She handed Linyu a kebab of hae own and thi showed none of hae usual reluctance to take it.

  "You'll have to get your own, Melna."

  "I figured you'd say that."

  Melna dismounted from Laen-Laen, careful not to disrupt Linyu, and approached a row of merchants selling a myriad of items.

  One called out to her, "Aye aren't you a beauty. A girl like you could use a pearl or two."  
  
  If she were just a few Na'to younger, she might have given in to such an idea, but she knew that she was old enough not to be called a girl, and just young enough to bask alone in the empty compliment.
  
  "Do saffa eat fish?" She asked a fisher.

  Thi replied, "Aye. They'll eat just about anything in my experience."

  "I'll have two of whatever you suggest, and four paddlebreads."

  "Alright then. Two Ferch," thi reached for the most expensive ones. "Do you want them grilled?"

  She thought it best to be safe, "Yes, please."

  The merchant set the fish onto a large pipe behind her that looked to be part of the city itself. Surprisingly, the fish started to sizzle right when they hit the metal.

  "That will be 90," thi said while wrapping the bread in dried kelp.

  Melna paused in confusion and then, recalling that she was no longer in the share community of Heiko, rummaged in her bag for two 50 coins and handed them over.

  "Keep the extra," she said.

  "Thank you!" said the merchant in a sing-song voice.

  Melna's curiosity made her ask more, "You all seem to be doing well even with the Obscura looming over Ara."

  "Yes. Well, when the vegetation dies off, the fish seem to bite at anything. Even if it's in a net."

  "Aren't you afraid that your fish will be next to die?"

  Thi moved to turn over the fish on the grill pipe.
  
  "Well, yes. But what can I do about that? It is not easy to dry fish with a dim Ara. They rot too quickly. And we have enough grain from Heiko to keep us going until Holragi figures out what's going on."

  "But what will you do if you run out of food before then?"

  "We must have faith. We would have killed each other in fear already if we didn't have faith."

  "I see," said Melna.

  "Your fish are ready."

  Thi handed her the two fish wrapped in dried kelp, and Melna accepted them, surprised by their weight. She paused, thinking to say something else, but settled on a simple "goodbye" and rejoined Linyu and Pomri.

  "The people here. They're blissfully ignorant of their impending doom," Melna said. She fed one of the fish to Laen-Laen, and the other to Pomri's saffa. "It's like they aren't prepared at all."

  Pomri replied in a serious tone, "I think you have us wrong, Melna. We know exactly what happens when starvation sets in. Our city was founded on it in a way. But we survived be helping one another. Nothing good comes from panic."

  "But the founders of Rudjan at least had alternate plans if things didn't go so well, didn't they?"

  "As settlers? No. They knew that their lives were in danger by traveling far from Shaki. They might not find food on the way, or they might not find the land they were looking for, or thieves in the know might jump them in the dark. But they left anyway. Going back was never an option. It's the same now as it was then. We would be better off dead than leaving the home we worked so hard to build."


<!--
  Linyu whimpered in fear at his name, drawing Pomri's attention.

  "Eh? What's gotten into you?" she asked.

  Thi was getting ready to jump off of Laen-Laen and run, but Melna had already become aware of hae and leapt back to hae.

  "Hey, Linyu. What's wrong?" asked Melna, holding onto hae arms.

  "Ramne," thi said in a cracked voice, "He..."

  Tears were forming at the corners of hae eyes.

  "What did he do?"

  "Mom," thi said, at the end of hae wit.




  "I take it you're not a boat person. Well, we can't go back now so you're either coming with us or you're on your own again."

  Thi took a moment, feeling angry at the predicament thi was put into. There was nowhere to run, standing outside a massive city barred from entry, and Laen-Laen, who could take hae anywhere if anywhere were safe anymore. Thi placed hae hand on Kip's pendant under hae shirt and closed hae eyes in thought.

  "Together," thi whispered. Pomri smiled at hae courage.
