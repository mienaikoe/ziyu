## Chapter 17

<!-- Gate -->

One gatekeeper stood vigil at a row of three ornate black steel gates mounted in the wall of Rudjan. She was bundled up in thick black cloth underneath a shining steel gorget with a rise to protect her neck and an etching of the Rudjan symbol of a ship on the broad front plate. The skeletal features of her face showed that she was of an older age than most keepers would have been but clearly still fit for her duties.

"Well look who it is," she scoffed as the group approached her, "The traitor and her band of thieves."

Pomri responded, "Such a warm welcome, Bavle."

"Oh, pardon my manners," she said facetiously, "Perhaps you'd like to be thrown off the bridge first."

"Perhaps you'd like this spear down your throat, ya cheeky cunt."

Melna glanced to the side and whispered, "Pomri, what's this about?"

But Bavle continued, "So tell me why I should let you bastards through."

A lull in the conversation formed while Melna watched their eyes turn toward her. Realizing they were waiting for her, she stuttered to begin, "W-we are on our way to a senate session. We would like to pass."

"No," said the guard.

"What? Why?"

"Well you haven't told me the password."

Melna paused, trying to understand such a ridiculous requirement. _A password? Since when was there a password to enter Rudjan?_. She thought deeply for a long and awkward moment, pondering what the password could be, when all of a sudden she heard a chuckle coming from Pomri, and then Bavle, and then boisterous laughing from the two.

Pomri exclaimed, "Oi! A password what fooled you, Melna?!"

Bavle joined her, "Are all your fidelants so dull?"

Melna was unamused at being the brunt of a joke, not to mention the waste of precious time, but she took whatever humor they could afford.

"Very funny," she said. A glare shot from Melna's eyes toward the still-laughing Pomri, and she quieted down, dismounting from her saffa and helping Linyu off of Laen.

"We have a train to catch," said Melna, "so please let us be on our way."

Bavle approached the saffa while she continued with her friend, "Oh I've missed your damn face, Pomri. Come back when Ara is back from the dead."

"I will. Just gotta save the world first," she responded.

"Just another day for you," she said with a voice almost motherly. "Well, the dockways aren't big enough for saffas so you'll have to leave them here. They'll be safe on these wetlands as long as they're well trained. And I assume since you made it this far, that won't be an issue?"

Melna said, "Yes, of course," remembering to herself how fussy Laen-Laen could get if he wasn't well fed.

"Laen," Linyu whispered to him, keeping a tight hold on his front leg.

Melna held her patience for hae. "He'll be fine here. This wetland is full of saffas and tasty things. This is where saffas come from, after all."

Linyu moved hae hands to Laen-Laen's neck, and scratched him gently, much to Laen's chagrin, while Melna faced him and said her own kind of goodbye.

"Hey Laen. We might be gone for a while. You should be safe with the other saffa out here. Make some friends, ok?"

He whooped low, hearing the uncertainty in her tone, but understanding that there were some things she had to do that weren't so fun. She nuzzled him despite his fishy breath and then reached out to Linyu to draw hae away. Pomri finished her own quiet goodbye to Giam and then led the two down a ramp to a small group of other saffa perched just outside the gate.

"Love you," Linyu whispered to the air which still brought Laen's scent to hae nose.

They returned to the center gate and knealt down in front of a small hole in the ground. She produced a short sword and a brass scabbard decorated with peculiar nodules and lightly thrust it into the hole. With a loud hiss, the gate began to open before them.

"You three keep a watchful eye," she warned them. "All sorts of trouble has been brewing lately."

"Thank you for letting us know. We'll be vigilant," said Melna. Her curious eye pulled her focus toward the woman's clothes, catching a glimpse of a healing wound on her chest.

Melna expressed her concern, "Bavle, will you be–"

"Shush," she said. "My place is to protect this gate. Neither fear of death nor promise of reward can take me from it."

"I see," said Melna.

Pomri approached and rose her left arm to Bavle, who hooked her own around it. They stood staring at each other for a moment in solidarity and then loosened their stances to let each other go. Following behind Pomri, Melna bowed in silent respect before bidding farewell to the keeper who had already turned to close the gate. Linyu's blind stare lingered on Bavle in wonder about her face, her story, or whether thi could trust her. But Melna peered into hae blue eyes, and scratched a bit at hae back.

"She'll be ok," she said.

<!-- Merchant's Quarter -->

The city opened upon a wide pier of a bustling market full of merchants on small ships. Their bows curled into large arcs and narrowed to a pillar to hold bobbing brass oil lanterns at their ends. To Melna they looked like some sort of firebreathing spirits of the sea, come to join with Rudjani society. Beyond the pier, an island of tall trees and lush grasses supported a great wooden tower that must have been built in the beginning, but had clear signs of repair over the years. Perhaps the entire city had been replaced over generations of maintainers, but there was no one person who knew. She paused to take in the view of the golden city she had only been to but a few times. The red twilight of this place had always complimented the lanterns, but somehow the dimming of Ara seemed to paint everything with a little bit life.

"Hey Linyu, have some of this," yelled Pomri from the side of the pier. She had already bought some grilled shellfish on a stick to eat and handed Linyu a kebab of hae own. Thi showed none of hae usual reluctance to take it.

"You'll have to get your own, Melna."

"I figured you'd say that."

She approached a row of merchants selling a myriad of items from the sea or the wetlands.

One called out to her, "Aye aren't you a beauty. Girl like you could use a pearl or two."

If she were just a few Na'to younger, she might have taken a second look for a pearl, yet she knew that she was well old enough not to be called a girl, and just young enough to indulge in empty compliments without getting tied down by their real intentions.

She approached a fisher and asked, "Do you have flatbread?"

Thi replied, "Aye. Make 'em fresh too."

"I'll have six of those and whatever fish you suggest."

"Alright then. Semah it will be. Fresh and extra colorful," thi reached for a red fish that was a bit larger than the size of hae hand.

"Do you want it cooked?"

"Yes, please," she replied.

The merchant set the fish onto a large pipe behind hae that looked to be part of the city itself. Surprisingly, the fish started to sizzle right when they hit the metal. From a clay pot, thi pulled out a large section of dough that she set on a counter and quickly divided into six balls. With methodical and skillful hands, she rolled them out on a small round table using the round handle of a short boat paddle, and then used the smooth flat bladed side to move the bread to the hot pipe as well.

"90 please," thi said, wiping hae hands on hae apron.

Melna hesitated, and then, recalling that she was no longer within Heiko, rummaged in her bag for two small glass spheres and handed them over.

"Keep the extra," she said.

"Thank you!" said the merchant in a sing-song voice.

Melna's curiosity made her ask more, "You all seem to be doing well even with the Obscura looming over Ara."

"Yes. Well, when the vegetation is scarce, the fish seem to bite at anything. Even if it's in a net."

"But surely, your fish will be next to die. What will you do then?"

Thi moved to turn over the fish and bread on the pipe.

"Then I'll catch bigger fish"

"And when those die?"

"Well, I suppose the Tilmarim would do."

Melna was getting irritated. "I'm asking... something deeper. When do you start to decide for yourself? When do you stop blindly trusting an unkeepable promise and seek survival on your own terms?"

"We have enough grain from Heiko to keep us going until Holrag figures out what's going on."

"And what if they don't?"

Thi looked around and then leaned in to whisper to her with a sneer, "Holrag has this under control. We must keep faith."

"I see," Melna replied, shocked at hae determined, almost fearful tone.

Thi went back to the pipe and pulled three long pieces of kelp from a barrel nearby to wrap the fish and bread. Hae gestures were quick and confident, as if hae mind were taking a rest and letting hae hands do all the thinking for a time.

"Your food is ready," thi said.

Melna accepted the three small packages carefully, surprised by their weight. She paused, thinking to say something else, but settled on a simple "goodbye" and departed to rejoin with the others. Upon her return she noticed Linyu standing in a corner, fiddling with a length of thin copper wire with a small glass bulb at the end and ignoring Pomri who was trying to make small talk.

"What is thi making?" Melna asked.

"I don't know. A seller had some seaweed hanging on it, and then Linyu felt it and got all excited. I was getting hungry anyway so I just bought both."

"I see", she said, curious but patient.

She turned to Linyu and announced, "Bread?" lighting up Linyu's face. Thi immediately put away the piece of wire and she handed them both a circle of bread each. She opened the wrapped fish and leaned against a wall near Linyu to eat.

"The people here," she addressed Pomri. "They're blissfully ignorant of their impending doom. It's like they aren't prepared at all."

Pomri disagreed with her, "I think you have us wrong, Melna. We know exactly what happens when starvation sets in. Our city was founded on it in a way. But we survived be helping one another. Nothing good comes from panic."

"But the founders of Rudjan at least had alternate plans if things didn't go so well, didn't they?"

"As settlers? No. They knew that their lives were in danger by traveling far from Shaki. They might not find food on the way, or they might not find the land they were looking for, or thieves in the know might jump them in the dark. But they left anyway. Going back was never an option. It's the same now as it was then. We would be better off dead than struggling under someone else's foot."

"I will applaud your peoples' clarity of purpose, if not your stubborn insistence on independence."

"We bow to no one, Melna. Not even to a fidelant."

Pomri and Melna finished their last morsels of lunch while Linyu had stopped about halfway through the bread to resume hae twisting of the wire.

Melna paused her lunch to help Linyu pack up the remaining bread. "Here. You can put the bread back so you can eat the rest later," she said to Linyu.

Thi said, "Okay," hae throat struggling a little less than before.

Melna trimmed Linyu's bread at the biting edge and put it back into its kelp package, nestling it snugly in Linyu's travel bag.

<!-- Talking about Ulukoma -->

"Have you ever been to Rudjan?" Melna asked hae while closing the bag.

"Before," thi said with a longing tone, stopping hae fiddling with the wire.

Thi hesitated and looked away, but Melna didn't relent this time.

"Linyu. I know that whatever happened to you must be difficult to remember, but if..." she hesitated to push her own troubles out of her mind. "If your parents or any of your family are out there, they must be worried looking for you."

"Fire... Woke here," thi said, straining through every word.

"Where was the fire?"

"Home."

"Ulukoma?"

Thi nodded.

"Do you remember how you got here?"

"I...No," thi said, realizing again the peculiarity of hae situation.

"Okay. Let's work backward then. What is the last thing you do remember?"

"Fire... nahn... Kipnu."

"Is he ok?" She asked, recalling his pendant amidst the flurry of events of the previous night. "Do you know where he is?"

"With. Mom," thi tried to speak, but hae voice trembled and came out as a whisper.

"He's with your mother?"

Thi looked sternly at her nose, staring at it with those blank eyes illuminating her face like a lantern on the end of a boat, searching for figures in the darkness.

"I. Don't. Know."

The protrusion of the pendant under Linyu's shirt drew Melna's eye, and brought a flush to her cheeks and a tear to her left eye.

"Wherever Kipnu is, he must be kicking up a storm with your mother."

"I Hope," thi said, hoping for a lot of things. <!-- TOOD -->

They held each other in silence, acknowledging their unique connection and the mystery of how it came to be, when Pomri butted in, "Žah-Melna, perhaps we should be on our way."

Melna nodded and reassured Linyu, "Just hold tightly to my hand, and I won't let you run into anything."

"Okay," thi said.

There was a pause and then she inhaled to rise and said "Let's get going."

Melna led the way while Pomri took the rear to keep a sharp eye for trouble. They passed over a bridge to the first island, upon which a public garden was built full of trees that grew high above the nearby buildings. With her hand around Linyu's shoulder, they kept moving away from merchants at the gate and toward the Northern quarter.

---

  <!-- At the conduit -->

Melna took a glance at the colors in the sky from behind the nest of wires leading to the conduit. It was nearly time for the train to arrive.

"We must be prompt", she told them. "I will go to the conduit alone while you two head on to the train station and secure a spot for me."

Linyu looked back with worried eyes, but Melna reassured hae, "I won't be long. Save me a seat near the window."

"Come on," said Pomri. She pulled hae up onto her shoulders with ease, and made her way toward the station before thi could object.

She lingered there watching them but for a moment, then with a swift turn Melna began trotting toward the conduit tower with her mind focused on Jesse and the strange dots in the sky.

The door flung open just before she could reach for it and a large man with disheveled robes appeared in the doorway. His face held no expression as he glanced in the direction of the train station, but the sweat on his neck and ears told a story of frustration. Melna noticed that his boots were peculiar. A thickly wound and thickly-grown kelp fabric covered his feet. It wasn't an exact match to Linyu's dusty shirt, but it bore a resemblance she couldn't ignore.

With a loud and quick huff he took off without looking, barrelling straight into Melna and paying her no mind as he kept his path. She looked back at him, incredulous, and said, "Hey, mind yourself!"

But there was no response in either eye or stride. She quickly measured her options and decided that she had just enough time to follow him to at least the center of the city. She could always get word from the observatory from Shaki, and she was suspicious that there was something he had just heard that she might find interesting.

She placed her steps as quickly as possible, trying to keep up as they entered a crowded islet near the center of the city. He seemed to move through the crowd without causing a stir, seeing openings in the chaos before they formed. A couple times, she thought she had lost him, but his messy robes made him easy to spot. They had nearly reached the pier to North Harbor before he turned south onto a small dock and slowed his pace to look for boats on his left side. Melna immediately took a position hiding behind a large wooden column as she looked on.

"The magistrate hasn't seen them in Shaki either," he said as he approached a boat. _Was he speaking to someone?_

"They must have gone to Heiko, it's the only place left."

Melna could barely make out the whispers of a response, but the boat seemed empty as far as she could tell. She watched him untie the boat from the dock and step in near the back. Without a pause, a rough shipping bag in the boat begin to move and out of it emerged a pair of glowing blue eyes. Melna felt a deluge of questions and fears and frustrations wash over her, but resolved to stay focused as long as she could. A woman came out of the bag and showed a terrible healing gash on the right side of her head. Melna was sure would have killed a normal person, but somehow she was alive and well.

"Those idiots. He said the whole place will be rubble in a matter of days."

_What?!_

"Hurry up. We need to move," he barked.

"Yes," she said in a broken whisper and crawled back into her satchel.

They paddled off into the canal toward South Harbor while Melna tried to piece together what she had just heard.

"This trip was doomed to fail. Holrag would never reveal their intensinos," she said to herself, trying to remain calm.

"I need to talk to Linyu."
