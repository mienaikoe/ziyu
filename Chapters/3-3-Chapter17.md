## Chapter 17

  One gatekeeper stood vigil at the gate of the bridge, bundled up in thick black cloth underneath a shining steel gorget with a rise to protect her neck from the sides and an etching of the Yanshan symbol of a ship on the broad front plate. The skeletal features of her face showed that she was of an older age than most keepers would have been but clearly still fit for her duties.

  "Heh," she scoffed as the group approached her, "The traitor and her master."

  Pomri rebuked her, "Such a warm welcome, Bavle. Now open the gate."

  "Yansha is locked to travel," an elderly guard told them at the gate into the city.

  "I am a Heiko senator passing through to Shaki. Please let us pass," Melna told him.

  "My apologies, žah, I cannot even open the gate. You'll have to find a way around."

  Pomri interjected, "That's crazy. We need to board the train."

  "I've told you all I know," said the guard.

  Melna held Linyu steady and jumped off of Laen-Laen's back to approach the guard while Pomri remained mounted.

  She asked him, "Can you ask anyone to open the gate?"

  "I'm locked out of the city until I am relieved from my shift at mid-day."

  "Yansha has never been this tightly locked. What is the reason?" Pomri demanded.

  "There is no more food or space to support refugees. We cannot risk taking in a single person as it would mean risking the lives of all our citizens."

  Pomri was visibly angry now. "This is ridiculous. Whose law is this?"

  "Our senators told us this was a decree that the entire senate has made."

  "If the senate had agreed on such a rule, I would have known," said Melna.

  "I don't know what to tell you, žah."

  Melna began to pace slowly, frustrated but holding steady on a more pensive state of mind. She pondered busting through the gate somehow, but ruled out the bending of thick steel bars as a matter of time.

  She turned to Pomri and asked, "What if we went the other way?"

  "What other way?"

  "You said the only way is through the desert. What about the ocean?"

  "The ocean is dangeorus without light or wind. If the vessel unhooks from the rail, we could be drifting out into the darkness."

  "Ah. I see," she said. She turned around to the guard and asked him, "Excuse me, do you know of a good ship and captain we could hire?"

  "Toward Shaki? There aren't many fishers who know that route."

  "Any ship will do, as long as we can trust the captain."

  "The only ships like that go to Ulukoma first. Check the far dock."

  "Thank you sir."

  "Oh and uh..." He hesitated. "There's a captain named Ramne who runs a ship that way. I wouldn't trust him."

  Linyu whimpered in fear at his name, drawing Pomri's attention.

  "Eh? What's gotten into you?" she asked.

  Thi was getting ready to jump off of Laen-Laen and run, but Melna had already become aware of hae and leapt back to hae.

  "Hey, Linyu. What's wrong?" asked Melna, holding onto hae arms.

  "Ramne," thi said in a cracked voice, "He..."

  Tears were forming at the corners of hae eyes.

  "What did he do?"

  "Mom," thi said, at the end of hae wit.

  "I take it you're not a boat person. Well, we can't go back now so you're either coming with us or you're on your own again."

  Thi took a moment, feeling angry at the predicament thi was put into. There was nowhere to run, standing outside a massive city barred from entry, and Laen-Laen, who could take hae anywhere if anywhere were safe anymore. Thi placed hae hand on Kip's pendant under hae shirt and closed hae eyes in thought.

  "Together," thi whispered. Pomri smiled at hae courage.

  "One night is all I ask," Said the fisherwoman, chiding a starving maman.

  "For a fish?"
