## Chapter 17

  "I am a Heiko senator passing through to Shaki. Please let us pass," Melna told him.

  "My apologies, Å¾ah, I can't even open the gates. You'll have to find a way around."

  Pomri interjected, "That's ridiculous. The only way around is through the desert."

  "I've told you all I know," said the guard.

  Melna asked him, "Can you ask anyone to open it?"

  "I'm locked out of the city until I am relieved from my shift at mid-day."

  "Yansha has never been this tightly locked. What is the reason?" Pomri demanded.
