## Chapter 17

<!-- Gate -->
  One gatekeeper stood vigil at the end of the bridge, bundled up in thick black cloth underneath a shining steel gorget with a rise to protect her neck from the sides and an etching of the Yanshan symbol of a ship on the broad front plate. The skeletal features of her face showed that she was of an older age than most keepers would have been but clearly still fit for her duties.

  "Well look who it is," she scoffed as the group approached her, "The traitor and the liar. Quite the band of thieves you make."

  Pomri responded, "Such a warm welcome, Bavle."

  "Oh, pardon my manners," she said facetiously, "Perhaps you'd like to be thrown across the rails first."

  "Perhaps you'd like this spear down your throat."

  Melna glanced to the side and whispered, "Pomri, what's this about?"

  But Bavle continued, "So tell me why I should let you bastards through."

  A lull in the conversation formed while Melna watched their eyes turn in her direction and stuttered to begin, "W-we are on our way to a senate session. We would like to pass."

  "No," said the guard.

  "What? Why?"

  "Well you haven't told me the password."

  Melna paused, trying to understand such a ridiculous requirement. *A password? Since when was there a password to enter Rudjan?*. She thought and thought for an awkward moment that had long overstayed its welcome, when all of a sudden she heard a chuckle coming from Pomri, and then Bavle, and then all out laughing from the two.

  "I didn't think she'd fall for that!" yelled Pomri. "A password?! Really, Melna?"

  Bavle joined her, "Is your senator honestly so dull?"

  Melna was unamused at being the brunt of a joke, not to mention the waste of precious time, but she took it in stride.

  "Ok, very funny," she said. "We have a train to catch, so please let us be on our way."

  A glare shot from Melna's eyes toward the still-laughing Pomri, and she quieted down, dismounting from her saffa and helping Linyu off of Laen.

  Bavle approached the saffa while she continued with her friend, "Oh I've missed your damn face, Pomri. Come back when Ara is back from the dead."

  "I will. Just gotta save the world first," she responded.

  "Just another day for you," she said with a voice almost motherly. "Your saffa will have to stay here, as the city really can't handle such large animals. They'll be safe on these wetlands as long as they're well trained. And I assume since you made it this far, that won't be an issue?"

  Melna said, "Yes, of course," remembering to herself how fussy Laen-Laen could get if he wasn't well fed.

  "Laen," Linyu whispered to him, keeping a tight hold on his front leg.

  Melna held her patience for hae. "He'll be fine here. This place is where saffas come from."

  Linyu moved hae hands to Laen-Laen's neck, and scratched him gently, much to Laen's chagrin, while Melna faced him and said her own kind of goodbye.

  "Hey Laen. We might be gone for a while. You should be safe with the other saffa out here. Make some friends, ok?"

  He whooped low, hearing the uncertainty in her tone, but understanding that there were some things that Pangum had to do that weren't so fun. She nuzzled him despite his fishy breath and then reached out to Linyu to draw hae away. Pomri finished her own quiet goodbye to Giam and then led the two to Bavle, who took them down a ramp to a small group of other saffa perched just outside the gate.

  "Love you," Linyu whispered to the air which still brought Laen's scent to hae nose.

  Bavle returned to the Ulu post of the gate and with a few effortless flicks of the finger, she unlocked and opened a thick steel door in the stone just the size of two people.

  "You three keep a watchful eye," she warned them. "All sorts of trouble has been brewing lately."

  "Thank you for letting us know. We'll be vigilant," said Melna. Her curious eye pulled her focus toward the woman's clothes, catching a glimpse of a healing wound on her chest.

  Pomri rose an arm to Bavle, who hooked her own around it. They stood staring at each other for a moment in solidarity and then loosened their stances to let each other go. Following behind Pomri, Melna bowed in silent respect before bidding farewell to the keeper who had already turned to close the gate. Linyu's blind stare lingered on Bavle in wonder about her face, her story, or whether thi could trust her. But Melna peered into hae blue eyes like flames in the twilight, scratched a bit at hae back and said, "She'll be ok."

<!-- Merchant's Quarter -->

  The city opened upon a wide pier of a bustling market full of merchants on small ships. Their bows curled into large arcs and narrowed to a pillar to hold bobbing brass oil lanterns at their ends. To Melna they looked like some sort of firebreathing spirits of the sea, come to join with Rudjanese society. Beyond the pier lie a small island upon which a great stone tower was built. She paused to take in the view of the golden city she had only been to but a few times. The red twilight of this place had always complimented the lanterns, but somehow the dimming of Ara seemed to paint everything with a little bit life.

  "Hey Linyu, have some of this," yelled Pomri from the side of the pier. She had already bought some grilled shellfish on a stick to eat and handed Linyu a kebab of hae own. Thi showed none of hae usual reluctance to take it.

  "You'll have to get your own, Melna."

  "I figured you'd say that."

  She approached a row of merchants selling a myriad of items from the sea or the wetlands.

  One called out to her, "Aye aren't you a beauty. A girl like you could use a pearl or two."  

  If she were just a few Na'to younger, she might have given in to such an idea, yet she knew that she was well old enough not to be called a girl, and just young enough to bask alone in the empty compliment.

  She approached a fisher and asked, "Do you have paddlebreads?"

  Thi replied, "Aye. Make 'em fresh too."

  "I'll have four of those and two of whatever fish you suggest."

  "Alright then. Two semah," thi reached for two red fish that were the size of hae hands. "Do you want them cooked?"

  "Yes, please."

  The merchant set the fish onto a large pipe behind hae that looked to be part of the city itself. Surprisingly, the fish started to sizzle right when they hit the metal. From a clay pot, thi also pulled out four small balls of dough and set them on a counter. With methodical and skillful hands, she rolled them out flat with the round handle of a short boat paddle, and then used the smooth flat blade to move the bread to the hot pipe as well.

  "That will be 90," thi said, wiping hae hands on hae apron.

  Melna paused in confusion and then, recalling that she was no longer within the communal economic zone of Heiko, rummaged in her bag for two 50 coins and handed them over.

  "Keep the extra," she said.

  "Thank you!" said the merchant in a sing-song voice.

  Melna's curiosity made her ask more, "You all seem to be doing well even with the Obscura looming over Ara."

  "Yes. Well, when the vegetation dies off, the fish seem to bite at anything. Even if it's in a net."

  "Aren't you afraid that your fish will be next to die?"

  Thi moved to turn over the fish on the grill pipe.

  "Well, yes. But what can I do about that? It is not easy to dry fish with a dim Ara. They rot too quickly. And we have enough grain from Heiko to keep us going until Holragi figures out what's going on."

  "But what will you do if you run out of food before then?"

  "We must have faith. We would have killed each other in fear already if we didn't have faith."

  "I see," said Melna.

  "Your fish are ready."

  Thi handed her the two fish wrapped in dried kelp, and Melna accepted them, surprised by their weight. She paused, thinking to say something else, but settled on a simple "goodbye" and rejoined with the others.

  "The people here. They're blissfully ignorant of their impending doom," Melna said. She fed one of the fish to Laen-Laen, and the other to Pomri's saffa. "It's like they aren't prepared at all."

  Pomri replied in a serious tone, "I think you have us wrong, Melna. We know exactly what happens when starvation sets in. Our city was founded on it in a way. But we survived be helping one another. Nothing good comes from panic."

  "But the founders of Rudjan at least had alternate plans if things didn't go so well, didn't they?"

  "As settlers? No. They knew that their lives were in danger by traveling far from Shaki. They might not find food on the way, or they might not find the land they were looking for, or thieves in the know might jump them in the dark. But they left anyway. Going back was never an option. It's the same now as it was then. We would be better off dead than struggling under someone else's foot."

  "I will applaud your peoples' clarity of purpose, if not your stubborn insistence on independence."

  "We bow to no one, Melna. Not even to a senator."

  "Well no need to bow, but shall we eat while making our way to the conduit?"

  <!-- No need to feed saffas if they can find tons of food on the wetlands. -->
  <!--  -->




<!--
  Linyu whimpered in fear at his name, drawing Pomri's attention.

  "Eh? What's gotten into you?" she asked.

  Thi was getting ready to jump off of Laen-Laen and run, but Melna had already become aware of hae and leapt back to hae.

  "Hey, Linyu. What's wrong?" asked Melna, holding onto hae arms.

  "Ramne," thi said in a cracked voice, "He..."

  Tears were forming at the corners of hae eyes.

  "What did he do?"

  "Mom," thi said, at the end of hae wit.




  "I take it you're not a boat person. Well, we can't go back now so you're either coming with us or you're on your own again."

  Thi took a moment, feeling angry at the predicament thi was put into. There was nowhere to run, standing outside a massive city barred from entry, and Laen-Laen, who could take hae anywhere if anywhere were safe anymore. Thi placed hae hand on Kip's pendant under hae shirt and closed hae eyes in thought.

  "Together," thi whispered. Pomri smiled at hae courage.
