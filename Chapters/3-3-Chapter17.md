## Chapter 17

<!-- Gate -->
  One gatekeeper stood vigil at the end of the bridge, bundled up in thick black cloth underneath a shining steel gorget with a rise to protect her neck from the sides and an etching of the Yanshan symbol of a ship on the broad front plate. The skeletal features of her face showed that she was of an older age than most keepers would have been but clearly still fit for her duties.

  "Well look who it is," she scoffed as the group approached her, "The traitor and the liar. Quite the band of thieves you make."

  Pomri responded, "Such a warm welcome, Bavle."

  "Oh, pardon my manners," she said facetiously, "Perhaps you'd like to be thrown across the rails first."

  "Perhaps you'd like this spear down your throat."

  Melna glanced to the side and whispered, "Pomri, what's this about?"

  But Bavle continued, "So tell me why I should let you bastards through."

  A lull in the conversation formed while Melna watched their eyes turn in her direction and stuttered to begin, "W-we are on our way to a senate session. We would like to pass."

  "No," said the guard.

  "What? Why?"

  "Well you haven't told me the password."

  Melna paused, trying to understand such a ridiculous requirement. *A password? Since when was there a password to enter Rudjan?*. She thought and thought for an awkward moment that had long overstayed its welcome, when all of a sudden she heard a chuckle coming from Pomri, and then Bavle, and then all out laughing from the two.

  "I didn't think she'd fall for that!" yelled Pomri. "A password?! Really, Melna?"

  Bavle joined her, "Is your senator honestly so dull?"

  Melna was unamused at being the brunt of a joke, not to mention the waste of precious time, but she took it in stride.

  "Ok, very funny," she said. "We have a train to catch, so please let us be on our way."

  A glare shot from Melna's eyes toward the still-laughing Pomri, and she quieted down, dismounting from her saffa and helping Linyu off of Laen.

  Bavle approached the saffa while she continued with her friend, "Oh I've missed your damn face, Pomri. Come back when Ara is back from the dead."

  "I will. Just gotta save the world first," she responded.

  "Just another day for you," she said with a voice almost motherly. "Your saffa will have to stay here, as the city really can't handle such large animals. They'll be safe on these wetlands as long as they're well trained. And I assume since you made it this far, that won't be an issue?"

  Melna said, "Yes, of course," remembering to herself how fussy Laen-Laen could get if he wasn't well fed.

  "Laen," Linyu whispered to him, keeping a tight hold on his front leg.

  Melna held her patience for hae. "He'll be fine here. This place is where saffas come from."

  Linyu moved hae hands to Laen-Laen's neck, and scratched him gently, much to Laen's chagrin, while Melna faced him and said her own kind of goodbye.

  "Hey Laen. We might be gone for a while. You should be safe with the other saffa out here. Make some friends, ok?"

  He whooped low, hearing the uncertainty in her tone, but understanding that there were some things that Pangum had to do that weren't so fun. She nuzzled him despite his fishy breath and then reached out to Linyu to draw hae away. Pomri finished her own quiet goodbye to Giam and then led the two to Bavle, who took them down a ramp to a small group of other saffa perched just outside the gate.

  "Love you," Linyu whispered to the air which still brought Laen's scent to hae nose.

  Bavle returned to the Ulu post of the gate and with a few effortless flicks of the finger, she unlocked and opened a thick steel door in the stone just the size of two people.

  "You three keep a watchful eye," she warned them. "All sorts of trouble has been brewing lately."

  "Thank you for letting us know. We'll be vigilant," said Melna. Her curious eye pulled her focus toward the woman's clothes, catching a glimpse of a healing wound on her chest.

  Pomri rose an arm to Bavle, who hooked her own around it. They stood staring at each other for a moment in solidarity and then loosened their stances to let each other go. Following behind Pomri, Melna bowed in silent respect before bidding farewell to the keeper who had already turned to close the gate. Linyu's blind stare lingered on Bavle in wonder about her face, her story, or whether thi could trust her. But Melna peered into hae blue eyes like flames in the twilight, scratched a bit at hae back and said, "She'll be ok."

<!-- Merchant's Quarter -->

  The city opened upon a wide pier of a bustling market full of merchants on small ships. Their bows curled into large arcs and narrowed to a pillar to hold bobbing brass oil lanterns at their ends. To Melna they looked like some sort of firebreathing spirits of the sea, come to join with Rudjanese society. Beyond the pier lie a small island upon which a great stone tower was built. She paused to take in the view of the golden city she had only been to but a few times. The red twilight of this place had always complimented the lanterns, but somehow the dimming of Ara seemed to paint everything with a little bit life.

  "Hey Linyu, have some of this," yelled Pomri from the side of the pier. She had already bought some grilled shellfish on a stick to eat and handed Linyu a kebab of hae own. Thi showed none of hae usual reluctance to take it.

  "You'll have to get your own, Melna."

  "I figured you'd say that."

  She approached a row of merchants selling a myriad of items from the sea or the wetlands.

  One called out to her, "Aye aren't you a beauty. A girl like you could use a pearl or two."  

  If she were just a few Na'to younger, she might have given in to such an idea, yet she knew that she was well old enough not to be called a girl, and just young enough to bask alone in the empty compliment.

  She approached a fisher and asked, "Do you have flatbreads?"

  Thi replied, "Aye. Make 'em fresh too."

  "I'll have six of those and whatever fish you suggest."

  "Alright then. Semah it will be. Just caught and extra colorful," thi reached for a red fish that was a bit larger than the size of hae hand. 
  
  "Do you want it cooked?"

  "Yes, please," she replied.

  The merchant set the fish onto a large pipe behind hae that looked to be part of the city itself. Surprisingly, the fish started to sizzle right when they hit the metal. From a clay pot, thi also pulled out six small balls of dough and set them on a counter. With methodical and skillful hands, she rolled them out on a small round table using the round handle of a short boat paddle, and then used the smooth flat blade to move the bread to the hot pipe as well.

  "90 please," thi said, wiping hae hands on hae apron.

  Melna hesitated and then, recalling that she was no longer within Heiko, rummaged in her bag for two 50 coins and handed them over.

  "Keep the extra," she said.

  "Thank you!" said the merchant in a sing-song voice.

  Melna's curiosity made her ask more, "You all seem to be doing well even with the Obscura looming over Ara."

  "Yes. Well, when the vegetation is scarce, the fish seem to bite at anything. Even if it's in a net."

  "But surely, your fish will be next to die. What will you do then?"

  Thi moved to turn over the fish and bread on the pipe.

  "Then I'll catch bigger fish"

  "And when those die?"

  "Well, I suppose the Tilmarim would do."

  Melna was getting irritated. "I suppose that I'm asking a question of nuance. Where is your line? Between blindly trusting an unkeepable promise and seeking survival on your own terms?"

  "We have enough grain from Heiko to keep us going until Holragi figures out what's going on."

  "But what will you do if you run out of food before then?"

  "We won't," thi said coldly. 

  "I see," Melna replied

  Thi went back to the pipe and pulled three long pieces of kelp from a barrel nearby to wrap the fish and bread. Hae gestures were quick and confident, as if hae mind were taking a rest and letting hae hands do all the thinking for a time.

  "Your food is ready," thi said.

  Melna accepted the three small packages carefully, surprised by their weight. She paused, thinking to say something else, but settled on a simple "goodbye" and departed to rejoin with the others. Upon her return she noticed Linyu standing in a corner, taking in the sounds and ignoring Pomri who was trying to make small talk.

  "Bread?," she butted in, lighting up Linyu's face. She handed them both a cake and then leaned against a wall near Linyu to eat her fish.

  "The people here," she addressed Pomri. "They're blissfully ignorant of their impending doom. It's like they aren't prepared at all."

  Pomri disagreed with her, "I think you have us wrong, Melna. We know exactly what happens when starvation sets in. Our city was founded on it in a way. But we survived be helping one another. Nothing good comes from panic."

  "But the founders of Rudjan at least had alternate plans if things didn't go so well, didn't they?"

  "As settlers? No. They knew that their lives were in danger by traveling far from Shaki. They might not find food on the way, or they might not find the land they were looking for, or thieves in the know might jump them in the dark. But they left anyway. Going back was never an option. It's the same now as it was then. We would be better off dead than struggling under someone else's foot."

  "I will applaud your peoples' clarity of purpose, if not your stubborn insistence on independence."

  "We bow to no one, Melna. Not even to a senator."

  Pomri and Melna finished their last morsels of lunch while Linyu had stopped about halfway through the bread.

  "Here. You can put the bread back so you can eat the rest later," she said to Linyu.

  Thi said, "Okay," hae throat struggling a little less than before.

  Melna trimmed Linyu's bread at the biting edge and then put it back into its kelp package.

  "We're headed to the trains toward Shaki, but first I have to stop by the conduit, ok?"

  She took hae hand and traced the path they would take on hae palm.

  "Just hold tightly to my hand, and I won't let you run into anything."

  "Okay," thi said.

  Melna led the way while Pomri took the rear to keep a sharper eye for trouble. They passed over a bridge to the first island, upon which a public garden was built full of trees that grew high above the nearby buildings.

<!-- Talking about Ulukoma -->

  "Have you been to a conduit before?" Melna asked along the path.

  "Before," thi said with a longing tone.

  "Before what?"

  Thi hesitated and looked away, but Melna didn't relent this time.

  "Linyu. I know that whatever happened to you must be difficult to remember, but if..." she hesitated to push her own troubles out of her mind. "If your parents or any of your family are out there, they must be worried looking for you."

  "Fire... Woke here," thi said, straining through every word.

  "Where was the fire?"

  "Home."

  "Where is home?"

  "...Ulu."

  "The ocean? Were you on a ship?"

  Thi didn't respond, looking confused and agitated.

  "Do you remember how you got here?"

  "I...No," thi said, realizing the peculiarity of hae situation.

  "Okay. Let's work backward then. What is the last thing you do remember?"

  "Fire... nana... Kipnu."

  Melna stopped in her tracks, aghast at hearing his name. "Kipnu? Were you in Ulukoma?"

  Thi reached into hae shirt and pulled out Kipnu's binding pendant, which Melna bent down to see for herself. A golden yellow reflection stared back at her through the mirror polish she grew to recognize. It was scratched, but only lightly.

  *What happened to you, Kip? How did a kaln find your pendant and then bring it all the way back here?*

  "Is... is he ok?" She asked. "Do you know where he is?"

  Thi fought with haeself to stay calm.

  "Mom," thi tried to speak, but hae voice trembled and came out as a whisper.

  "Your mother – he's with your mother?"

  Thi looked sternly at her nose, staring at Melna's nose with those blank eyes illuminating her face like a lantern on the end of a boat, searching for figures in the darkness.

  "I. Don't. Know."

  "Please," Melna pleaded to hae, "Let me have this. Him and I are bound with Liffa."

  Thi pressed it tightly against hae chest, not in a protective manner, but taking time to cherish the memories of the man who saved hae from drowning.

  "Okay," thi said, and lifted the pendant from hae neck to place it over Melna's.

  "Thank you, Linyu. Wherever Kipnu is, I know he must trust you a lot to have given this to you."

  "I Hope," thi said, hoping for a lot of things. <!-- TOOD -->

  They held each other in silence, acknowledging their unique connection and the mystery of how it came to be, when Pomri butted in, "Žah-Melna, perhaps we should be on our way."

  Melna paused and then inhaled to rise, and said "Yes. Let's get going."

  And with her hand around Linyu's shoulder, they kept moving away from merchants at the gate and toward the Northern quarter.

  ********

  <!-- At the conduit -->

  Melna took a glance at the colors in the sky from behind the nest of wires leading to the conduit. It was nearly time for the train to arrive. 
  
  "We must be prompt", she told them. "I will go to the conduit alone while you two head on to the train station and secure a spot for me."
  
  Linyu looked back with worried eyes, but Melna reassured hae, "I won't be long. Save me a seat near the window."
  
  "Come on," said Pomri. She pulled hae up onto her shoulders with ease, and made her way toward the station before thi could object.

  She lingered there watching them but for a moment, then with a swift turn Melna began trotting toward the conduit tower with her mind focused on Thimlu and the strange dots in the sky.

  The door slammed open just before she could reach for it and a large man with a disheveled look appeard out of it. His face held no expression, but the thickness and sweat on his ears told another story. Without looking, he walked straight toward Melna and paid her no mind as he shoved his way past her. She looked back at him, trying to gather why the man was in such a state, and found nothing of note but a boot of the same reed cloth that Linyu had worn. She considered the smarter option of maintaining her current path, but ultimately decided the dumb option of chasing after him.

  "Hey! You!" she called to him, but he didn't respond, but kept walking quickly through the people on the islet. She started to run after him onto a pier toward the shipping district, but he seemed to move through the people without causing a stir. 



  <!--

  "Ramne. Who is Ramne?"

  "I've heard of him," Pomri chimed in. "He used to be some nobody in the Rudjan guard who thought he was smarter than the rest of us. Never got promoted, so he just left us one day without a trace."


  Fajro captures Melna

  Linyu and Pomri don't make it on the train, and disappear effectively.

   -->




<!--
  Linyu whimpered in fear at his name, drawing Pomri's attention.

  "Eh? What's gotten into you?" she asked.

  Thi was getting ready to jump off of Laen-Laen and run, but Melna had already become aware of hae and leapt back to hae.

  "Hey, Linyu. What's wrong?" asked Melna, holding onto hae arms.

  "Ramne," thi said in a cracked voice, "He..."

  Tears were forming at the corners of hae eyes.

  "What did he do?"

  "Mom," thi said, at the end of hae wit.




  "I take it you're not a boat person. Well, we can't go back now so you're either coming with us or you're on your own again."

  Thi took a moment, feeling angry at the predicament thi was put into. There was nowhere to run, standing outside a massive city barred from entry, and Laen-Laen, who could take hae anywhere if anywhere were safe anymore. Thi placed hae hand on Kip's pendant under hae shirt and closed hae eyes in thought.

  "Together," thi whispered. Pomri smiled at hae courage.
