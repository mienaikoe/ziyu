## Chapter 17

A lone citykeeper stood vigil at a row of three ornate black steel gates mounted in the wall of Rudjan. She was bundled up in thick gray cloth underneath a shining steel gorget with a rise to protect her neck and an etching of a ship on the broad front plate. Her broad cheekbones and wrinkled mouth showed that she was of an older age than most keepers would have been but it was clear she could still handle a group of bandits with ease.

"Well look who it is," she scoffed as the group approached her, "The traitor and her band of thieves."

Pomri responded with a fake smile, "Such a warm welcome, Bavle."

"Oh, pardon my manners," she said facetiously. She pointed to the wetlands below them. "Perhaps you'd like a drop of water first."

Pomri banged her spear on the bridge. "Perhaps you'd like this spear down your throat, ya cheeky cunt."

"Pomri, what's this about?" Melna whispered.

But Bavle cut her off, "So tell me why I should let you bastards through."

A lull in the conversation formed while Melna watched their eyes turn toward her. It took a moment for her to realize, then she took a quick breath to begin, "Oh. We are on our way to a senate session. We would like to pass."

"No," said the guard.

"What? Why?"

"Well, you haven't told me the password."

"A password?"

"Oh yes. Every city has them ever since The Band of Thieves infiltrated the gates of Yansha."

Melna paused, trying to understand such a ridiculous requirement. _Since when was there a password to enter Rudjan? And who is The Band of Thieves? Why did nobody brief me on them?!_. She thought deeply for a long and awkward moment, pondering what the password could be, when all of a sudden she heard a chuckle coming from Pomri, and then Bavle, and then boisterous laughing from the two.

Pomri exclaimed, "Oi! A password? The Band of Thieves? Really, Melna?"

Bavle joined her, "Are all your fidelants so dull?"

Melna was unamused at being the brunt of a joke, not to mention the waste of precious time, but she took whatever humor they could afford.

"Very funny," she said. A glare shot from Melna's eyes toward the still-laughing Pomri, and she quieted down and helped Linyu off of Laen-Laen.

"We have a train to catch," said Melna, "so please let us be on our way."

Bavle approached the saffa while she continued with her friend, "Oh I've missed your ugly face, Pomri. Come back when you're done running around with this dullard."

Melna cleared her throat, uneasy with how brazenly they insulted her.

"Count on it," said Pomri, "Just gotta save the world first."

"Just another day for you," said Bavle with a voice almost motherly. "Well, the dockways aren't big enough for saffas so you'll have to leave them here. They'll be safe on these wetlands as long as they're well trained. And I assume since you made it this far, that won't be an issue?"

"Yes, of course," said Melna, impatient to end the conversation.

"Laen," Linyu whispered to him, keeping a tight hold on his fur.

Melna held her impatience for a moment, for Linyu's sake.

"He'll be fine here," she said. "This wetland is full of saffas and tasty things. This is where saffas come from, after all."

Linyu moved hae hands to Laen-Laen's neck, and scratched him gently, to Laen's chagrin, while Melna faced him and said her own kind of goodbye.

"Hey Laen. We might be gone for a while. You should be safe with the other saffas out here. Make some friends, ok?"

He whooped low, hearing the uncertainty in her tone, but understanding that there were some things she had to do that wouldn't be as fun. She nuzzled him despite his fishy breath and then reached out to Linyu to draw hae away. Pomri finished her own quiet goodbye to Boon-Boon and then led the two down a ramp to a small group of other saffa perched just outside the gate.

"Love. you," Linyu whispered to the air. Laen's scent still lingered in hae nose.

They returned to the center gate to find Bavle kneeling down in front of a small hole in the ground. She produced a short sword with a brass scabbard decorated with peculiar nubbins and grooves and firmly thrust it into the hole. With a loud hiss and a cloud of steam, the gate began to open before them.

"You three keep a watchful eye," she warned them. "All sorts of trouble has been brewing lately."

"Thank you for letting us know. We'll be vigilant," said Melna. Her curious eye pulled her focus toward the woman's clothes, catching a glimpse of a healing wound on her chest. Melna knew now that her words were more serious than her tone suggested.

"Bavle, will you be–"

"Shush," she said. "My place is to protect this gate. Neither fear of death nor promise of reward can take me from it."

"I see," said Melna.

Pomri approached and rose her left arm to Bavle, who hooked her own around it. They stood staring at each other for a moment in solidarity and then loosened their stances to let each other go. Following behind Pomri, Melna bowed in silent respect before bidding farewell to the keeper who had already turned to close the gate. Linyu's blind stare lingered on Bavle in wonder about her face, her story, or whether thi could trust her. But Melna peered into hae blue eyes, and scratched a bit at hae back.

"She'll be ok," she said.

The city opened upon a wide pier of a bustling market full of merchants on small ships. Their bows rose into large upward arcs that narrowed and curled above their heads. From each one, a pendulating brass oil lanterns hung, sending the sweet piny fragrance of anomin smoke into the air. To Melna the boats looked like some sort of firebreathing spirits of the sea, come to join with Rudjani society.

Beyond the pier, an island of tall trees and ruddy lichens supported a great wooden tower. The architecture seemed quite old, from before the discovery of steel in Holrag, but there were clear signs of new wood alongside the old over the years. Melna spotted this pattern in other buildings and imagined that the entire city had been completely replaced over countless generations of throngian history, but that nobody could say for sure.

She paused to take in the sights of this golden city she had only been to but a few times. The city she remembered had more color, with the white light of Ara complimenting the amber glow of the lanterns, filling everything with a sort of warmth. Today, their faces were painted in silhouettes and firelight, though none of them seemed to mind it at all.

"Hey Linyu, have some of this," yelled Pomri from the side of the pier. She had already bought some grilled shellfish on a stick to eat and handed Linyu a skewer of hae own. Hae face showed appreciation instead of reluctance.

"I'm not buyin' for you," she told Melna parenthetically.

"I'm not surprised."

Melna approached a row of merchants selling a myriad of items from the sea or the wetlands.

A man on a steel-clad boat called out to her, "Aye aren't you a beauty. Girl like you could use a pearl or two."

If Melna were just a few Na'to younger she might have found such a compliment endearing, but with age she'd learned to simply indulge in such empty compliments and spend her Shaki money elsewhere.

She approached a fisher's boat where she spotted a grain barrel and asked the maman, "Do you have flatbread?"

Thi replied, "Aye. Make 'em fresh too."

"I'll have six and whatever fish you suggest."

"Alright then. We caught a lot of semah today. Fresh and extra colorful," thi reached into a barrel submerged in the water and pulled out a red fish that was a bit larger than the size of hae hand.

"Do you want it cooked?" thi asked.

Melna was taken aback by the sight for a moment by the thought of death.

"Yes." she replied, not moving her eyes from the fish.

The merchant stunned it with a quick slap on a pipe and gracefully removed its scales and innards. Within seconds, thi had set it onto a larger pipe behind hae that looked to be part of the city itself. Surprisingly, the fish started to sizzle right when it hit the metal.

From a clay pot, thi pulled out a large chunk of dough and set it on a counter, quickly dividing it into six even balls. With methodical and skillful hands, she used a boat paddle to roll them flat, then used the blade end to move the bread onto another part of the hot pipe.

"Ninety please," thi said, wiping hae hands on hae apron.

Melna hesitated, then recalled that she was no longer within Heiko. She rummaged in her bag for two small brass rings with etchings on the inside and handed them over.

"Keep the extra," she said.

"Thank you!" said the merchant in a sing-song voice.

Melna was surprised at the merchant's tone, which matched every other person she'd seen in this city. She said, "You all seem to be doing well even with the Obscura looming over Ara."

"Yes. Well, when the vegetation is scarce, the fish seem to bite at anything. Even if it's in a net."

"But surely, your fish will be next to die. What will you do then?"

Thi moved to turn over the fish and bread on the pipe.

"Then I'll catch bigger fish"

"And when those die?"

"Well, I suppose the Tilmarim would do."

Melna was getting irritated. "But where do you draw the line? How far do you carry on until you seek survival on your own terms?"

"We have enough grain from Heiko to keep us going until Holrag figures out what's going on."

"And what if they don't?"

Thi stared back at her with anger in hae eyes and in hae tone.

"Holrag is in control of the problem," thi whispered loudly. "We must keep faith."

"I see," Melna replied. She had gotten all the information she needed.

Thi went back to the pipe and pulled three long pieces of kelp from a barrel nearby to wrap the fish and bread. Hae gestures were quick and confident, as if hae mind were taking a rest and letting hae hands do all the thinking.

"Your food is ready," thi said politely, as if nothing had happened.

Melna accepted the three small packages carefully, surprised by their weight. She paused, thinking to say something else, but settled on a simple "goodbye" and departed to rejoin with the others. Upon her return she noticed Linyu stooping in a corner, fiddling with a thin length of copper wire and ignoring Pomri who was trying to make small talk.

"What is thi making?" Melna asked.

"I don't know. A seller had some crispy seaweed hanging on it. Linyu felt it and got all excited. I was still hungry so I just bought the whole line."

She was amused. "I see", she said.

She turned to Linyu and asked hae, "Would you like some bread?" and Linyu's face lit up. Thi immediately put away the copper wire and she handed them both a circle of bread each. Carefully, she opened the wrapped fish and held it out for Linyu to share with her. She fixated on its eyes again, but only for a moment before she took some between two halves of the bread.

"The people here," she addressed Pomri. "They're blissfully ignorant of their impending doom. It's like they aren't prepared at all."

Pomri disagreed with her, "I think you have us wrong, Melna. We know exactly what happens when starvation sets in. Our city was founded on it, but we survived by helping one another. Nothing good ever comes from panic."

"But the founders of Rudjan at least had alternate plans if things didn't go so well, didn't they?"

"As settlers? No. They knew that their lives were in danger by traveling far from Shaki. They might not find food on the way, or they might not find the land they were looking for, or some tilmarims might ambush them in the dark. But they left anyway. Going back was never an option. It's the same now as it was then. We would be better off dead than struggling under someone else's foot."

"I will applaud your peoples' insistence on independence, if they weren't counting on Holrag to fix everything."

"We bow to no one, Melna. Holrag is but a convenient ally during this mess."

"Let's just hope they're as sincere as they say."

Pomri and Melna finished their last morsels of lunch while Linyu had stopped about halfway through the bread to resume hae twisting of the wire.

"Here", said Melna. "You can put the bread back so you can eat the rest later," she said to Linyu.

Thi said, "Okay," hae throat struggling a little less than before.

Melna trimmed Linyu's bread at the biting edge, packed it neatly into the kelp package that the merchant had given her, and nestled it snugly in Linyu's travel bag.

"Before, when Pomri asked you about Rudjan, you said 'home'. Is this where you're from?" Melna asked hae while closing the bag.

Thi stopped fiddling with the wire and looked away, but Melna didn't relent this time.

"Linyu. I know that whatever happened to you must be difficult to remember, but if..." she hesitated to push her own troubles out of her mind. "If your parents or any of your family are out there, they must be looking for you."

"Ulu," thi said, straining through every syllable.

"Ulu? Ulukoma?"

Thi nodded. "Home," thi said.

"Do you remember how you got here?"

"No," thi said, realizing again the peculiarity of hae situation.

"Okay. Let's work backward then. What is the last thing you do remember?"

"Ocean... Kip."

"Is he ok?" She asked, recalling his pendant amidst the flurry of events of the previous night. "Do you know where he is?"

"Mom," thi tried to speak, but hae voice trembled and came out as a whisper.

"He's with your mother?"

Thi looked sternly at her nose, staring at it with those blank eyes illuminating her face like a lantern on the end of a boat, searching for figures in the darkness.

"I. Don't."

The protrusion of the pendant under Linyu's shirt drew Melna's eye, and brought a flush to her cheeks and a tear to her left eye.

"Wherever Kipnu is, he must be kicking up a storm with your mother."

"Yes," thi said, mustering a broken smile.

They held each other in silence, acknowledging their unique connection and the mystery of how it came to be, when Pomri butted in, "Žah-Melna, perhaps we should be on our way."

Melna nodded and reassured Linyu, "Just hold tightly to my hand, and I won't let you run into anything."

"Okay," thi said.

There was a pause and then she inhaled to rise and said "Let's get going."

Melna led the way while Pomri took the rear to keep a sharp eye for trouble. They passed over a bridge to the first island, upon which a public garden was built full of trees that grew high above the nearby buildings. With her hand around Linyu's shoulder, they kept moving away from merchants at the gate and toward the Northern quarter.

---

Melna took a glance at the colors in the sky from behind the nest of wires leading to the conduit. It was nearly time for the train to arrive.

"We must be prompt", she told them. "I'll go to the conduit alone while you two head on to the train station and secure a spot for me."

Linyu looked back with worried eyes, but Melna reassured hae, "I won't be long. Save me a seat near the window."

"Come on," said Pomri. She pulled hae up onto her shoulders with ease, and made her way toward the station before thi could object.

She lingered there watching them but for a moment, then with a swift turn Melna began trotting toward the conduit tower with her mind refocusing on the two observers and the strange dots in the sky.

The door flung open just before she could reach for it and a large man with disheveled robes appeared in the doorway. His face held no expression as he glanced in the direction of the train station, but the sweat on his neck and ears told a story of frustration. Melna noticed that his boots were peculiar. A thickly wound and thickly-grown kelp fabric covered his feet. It wasn't an exact match to Linyu's dusty shirt, but it bore a resemblance she couldn't ignore.

With a loud and quick huff he took off without looking, barrelling straight into Melna and paying her no mind as he kept his path. She looked back at him, incredulous, and said, "Mind yourself!"

But there was no response in either eye or stride. She quickly measured her options and decided that she had just enough time to follow him to at least the center of the city. She could always get word from the observatory from Shaki, and she was suspicious that there was something brewing that an angry man like him could divulge.

She placed her steps as quickly as possible, trying to keep up as they entered a crowded islet near the center of the city. He seemed to move through the crowd without causing a stir, seeing openings in the chaos before they formed. A couple times, she thought she had lost him, but his messy robes made him easy to spot. They had nearly reached the pier to North Harbor before he turned south onto a small dock and slowed his pace to look for boats. Melna immediately took a position hiding behind a large wooden column as she looked on.

"The magistrate hasn't seen them in Shaki either," he said as he approached a boat. _Was he speaking to someone?_

"They must have gone to Heiko, it's the only place left."

Melna could barely make out the whispers of a response, but the boat seemed empty as far as she could tell. She watched him untie the boat from the dock with one hand and step in near the back. Without a pause, a rough shipping bag in the boat begin to move and from it emerged a pair of glowing blue eyes. On the right side of hae head was a terrible gash that was healing. She was sure such an injury would have killed a normal person, but somehow this maman was alive and well. A deluge of questions washed over her, but she resolved to stay focused as long as she could.

"Those idiots. He said the whole place will be rubble by tomorrow."

_What?!_

"What are you waiting for?" he barked at hae. "Start paddling."

They paddled off into the canal toward South Harbor while Melna pieced together what she had just heard.

"This trip was doomed to fail," she whispered to herself. "Those projectiles are meant for Heiko."

She tried to remain calm, but her mind refused to be clear.

"I need to find Pomri."
