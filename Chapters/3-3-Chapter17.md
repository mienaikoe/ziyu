## Chapter 17

  "Yansha is locked to travel," an elderly guard told them at the gate into the city.

  "I am a Heiko senator passing through to Shaki. Please let us pass," Melna told him.

  "My apologies, žah, I cannot even open the gate. You'll have to find a way around."

  Pomri interjected, "That's crazy. We need to board the train."

  "I've told you all I know," said the guard.

  Melna made room for Linyu and jumped off of Laen-Laen's back to approach the guard. Pomri remained mounted.
  
  She asked him, "Can you ask anyone to open the gate?"

  "I'm locked out of the city until I am relieved from my shift at mid-day."

  "Yansha has never been this tightly locked. What is the reason?" Pomri demanded.

  "There is no more food or space to support refugees. We cannot risk taking in a single person as it would mean risking the lives of all our citizens."

  Pomri was visibly angry now. "This is ridiculous. Whose law is this?"

  "Our senators told us this was a decree that the entire senate has made."

  "If the senate had agreed on such a rule, I would have known," said Melna.

  "I don't know what to tell you, žah."

  Melna began to pace slowly, frustrated but holding steady on a more pensive state of mind. She pondered busting through the gate somehow, but ruled out the bending of thick steel bars as a matter of time.

  She turned to Pomri and asked, "What if we went the other way?"

  "What other way?"

  "You said the only way is through the desert. What about the ocean?"

  "The ocean is dangeorus in this darkness and without the wind. If the vessel unhooks from the rail, we could be drifting out into the darkness."
