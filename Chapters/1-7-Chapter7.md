## Chapter 7

_"Do you hear it"_

I paused, listening intently for the sound.

_"The tree... do you hear it?"_

I looked up at my mother's chin, illuminated by the low Ara-light of morning, and then out to the leaves on the tree swaying in the dim light.

_"The ziyu speaks"_

"In the silence," I finished hae sentence.

Thi held me closer but felt cold and fragile, like oversaturated clay. Thi kept a smile on her face as thi began to disintegrate between my fingers.

_"silence,"_ thi whispered, and I could no longer distinguish her voice from the wind.

"Mama, Where are you going?!" I said, bewildered.

_"silence."_

Thi sublimated and coalesced into a cloud and vanished into the tree, turning its bark an earthen orange. The breeze picked up and the song of the Ziyu sang loudly all around me as I lay grasping the roots where my mother last spoke. I listened closer to the sound; closer than before. _What am I listening for?_

"Good Morning, Liffa."

I woke in startled moans, _am I at home?_

"Sorry Liffa, hope I didn't scare you."

_The darkness. The hard floor. Where am I?_

"I'm the magistrate for your case. They told you I would be here, no?"

It all came back to me and my heart dropped again. I sat up and brushed off my back.

"Yea. They said you would be here tomorrow morning."

"It is tomorrow morning."

_Ohh_

He continued, "I can come back once you're fully awake."

"It's probably best you don't. I would be a mess if I were awake for this."

"Suit yourself."

The magistrate carried a lantern just as yesterday. He wore charcoal gray tightly-woven robes with a white inner layer and a red waist sash of the style of Shaki legalists. His facial expression showed the experience and clarity of at least a Ma'To as an orator.

He cleared his throat, mostly as a warmup, and began in a pronounced and regal tone.

"Liffa Um Heiko, you have been charged with corruption of consciousness and interruption of the senate during its deliberation. Do you understand?"

"I do."

"As a magistrate, it is my duty to uncover the facts surrounding a matter and deliver a just punishment under the law. Do you understand?"

"I do."

"Do you submit to questioning so that Shaki may uncover these facts and root out any lies of the accused."

"I do."

He broke into a more casual tone, "So at this point, I'm just gonna ask you some questions about yesterday, and make sure they check out with what I heard from the other interviews."

I was a bit surprised, but stammered an "Okay" in my sleepy stupor. He hung the lantern up on a hook and produced a paper and charcoal.

"All right. Question one -"

"Wait.. Why are you being so nice to me? I'm a criminal."

"I find these things go smoother when I'm not judging you from my shining pedestal on high. We all do strange stuff. Whether we feel convinced it's the right thing, or a fit of passion compelled us. I'm not here to judge you personally. I'm just here to translate the law."

"Oh. That makes sense."

"So anyway, Question one. What did you barge into the senate for?"

"I had to announce some news."

"It couldn't wait until after deliberation?"

"It was highly urgent; I had to get it out before they locked themselves into a spending decision or adjourned and left for the day."

"Did the senate agree?"

"It's uncertain. I think you'll find many who did."

He finished jotting his notes and then turned the page for the next question.

"Question two. How did you come upon this news?"

"It was hand-delivered to me by the lead Ara observer of Heiko."

"Why wasn't the observer the one to deliver it?"

"He had to continue his observations."

"And your job?"

"I'm just a farmer. I can skip a day and make it up later."

"Well, not anymore," he said under his breath, and continued.

"So why was this message delivery delegated to you, Liffa?"

"It was intended for Melna, my jundwoman."

"Melna? As in žah-Melna, the Heiko fidelant?"

"Yes."

"Ah. I see."

He wrote some more notes and turned the page again.

"So that leads to question 3. How did you get into the deliberation hall in the first place?"

"I was helping a disabled ex-fidelant who was traveling to the senate."

"My, you certainly walk in high circles. You have a name?"

He stared at me, while I hesitated.

He said, "Come on, Liffa. I've got no intention of nabbing your friend. There's nothing illegal about an ex-fidelant walking the grounds."

I thought about what Melna said about him. To never trust Fajro. Perhaps the truth would help me more than protecting him would.

"Fajro. He was a fidelant for Holrag."

"Fajro, eh? That explains why he was so eager to ask about you."

"He asked about me?"

"You could say that. But we'll talk about that later. You were saying?"

"Oh. Yes, I was helping him walk on account of his injured leg, and he was helping me get to the deliberation hall. He believed in the importance of the news too."

"And how exactly did he help you?"

"He distracted the guards while I... snuck in."

"Ah, that makes sense."

He finished writing and folded the paper into an inner pocket of his robe.

"Ok, I have to get all formal again, now."

He took the lantern in his hand and reassumed his regal pose. It made me nervous even though it seemed silly.

"Liffa Um Heiko, I have gathered as many facts as I could and have reached a conclusion. I find you innocent of corruption of consciousness under the codex of Palinan and absolve you of all accusations of such claim."

I felt a slight relief, but knew the other was inescapable.

"However, the codex of the senate makes clear that any interruption of any kind during deliberation is illegal. For this reason, I find you guilty of interruption of the senate during its deliberation."

The conviction was expected, but it still hurt.

"The sentence shall be a period of three La'To in Ulukoma. Do you understa-"

The door opened in a rush, and the magistrate paused to see who caused the disturbance. Two lanterns were in view.

"Fajro? What are you doing here?" the magistrate asked.

I was thinking the same thing, but I quickly changed my mind when I saw the other face.

"Kipnu! You came!" I shouted.

He rushed to me and reached for my face with his free hand. Fajro walked in his slower pace toward us and attempted to bow to the magistrate.

"Oh there isn't any need of that," the magistrate said.

"Pardon my old habits. They've taken a permanent residence with me." He responded.

He reached the other side of Kipnu and looked closely at me, trying to telegraph something but I did not know what.

"I hope we came in time to defend Liffa," he said.

The magistrate responded, "Well, it's a little bit late, but I'll permit it if you have something to say worth adding."

The magistrate turned to me and asked, "Liffa, do you approve of Fajro's testimony?"

"Only if Kipnu is allowed to speak as well."

"Yes, that would be fine."

The magistrate took his paper and charcoal out again and turned to Fajro, motioning for him to speak.

Fajro began, "Liffa was helping me walk. I intended to interrupt the senate myself, and unwittingly inspired hae to finish the job when I was stopped by guards."

I was aghast. He was taking the blame? For what?

The magistrate stopped writing and laid his forehead into his hand. "That's quite a thing to admit, Fajro, but Liffa was still the one who actually interrupted the deliberation."

He replied, "I understand. My only hope for my testimony is that you give a lighter sentence to a maman who was acting under my orders."

"Well, the codex of the senate has pretty clear guidelines on sentencing for interruption. I would be risking my post if I let hae free without punishment."

Kipnu turned to the magistrate and pleaded to him, "Please sir. Liffa had every positive intention. Thi doesn't deserve to be shipped off."

Fajro chimed in, "Perhaps an alternative arrangement can be made. One that is beneficial to both Liffa and all of Palinan."

Kipnu and the magistrate turned to him to hear more.

"If Liffa is inclined, thi could work with me in Holrag on our observational study of the obstruction."

I replied immediately, "I am not inclined."

"Hold on, Liffa, let me finish. You would be working with our scientists to send a spacecraft up and figure out what we're dealing with. It would take no more than a few days[^1], then you can head back home to Heiko."

[^1]: A day on Palinan takes approximately 3½ earth days.

I retorted, "What use would a farmer be to scientists?"

"An ex-engineer, you mean."

I was aghast. How could he possibly know that?

"I know how you gave up your aspirations for the family business. Honorable, but such a waste of talent."

He was looking straight at me now, with a sincerity that was unmistakeable.

"I've seen your eyes. The blood of Holrag is within you. It's been calling since you were born. You must have studied with the observers just to imagine your own _nul sa'am_ to the stars. This journey was meant for you."

I thought of Jathi, surmised they would need his help to get a vehicle up there and back down again, but I wondered what would convince him. Then I remembered what Melna said about Fajro: his words were a cover for his actions.

"I don't trust you. You could do anything with me," I said.

"You're right. You can't trust me. But you also can't trust any of the criminals in that detestable Ulukoma either."

He took a step closer and I stepped back.

"Think of it this way," he explained. "If something were to harm the you under my watch – the Heiko fidelant's maman, the selfless hero-messenger – it would be disastrous for our entire project. You will surely be in safe hands. A few days on the frontlines of our very species is surely much better than whatever you would get in Ulukoma."

The magistrate butted in, "I believe that Fajro's suggestion would be a fitting alternative and that the state would see more use in applying you to the problem than sending you someplace where you mindlessly twiddle your thumbs in the cold.."

I withdrew from the door and faced the wall. I had never felt so powerless before: my fate was being discussed by a room full of powerful men while I stood in a cell, listening, understanding, with only a choice between two terrible situations. The silence in this room surrounded me, stifled my mind, begged me for an answer. Only the pulse in my head and the gentle shifting of cloth were audible.

"Let's give hae a moment, guys," I heard Kipnu say.

I turned around and found the back of his head and said "Wait, Kipnu. Just you."

The others gathered their lanterns and moved to the other room, the magistrate wrapping his arm around Fajro to help. I walked toward Kipnu but didn't reach for him this time.

"How many people know?" I asked him.

"Know what?"

"What I came here to announce."

"Only the senate. Melna told me it's up to each province to decide that for itself. The governor of Heiko has decided to reveal by hierarchy."

"What's that?"

"In order to stave off panic, people are told one-by-one in private rooms and are given tasks to help so they don't just mentally shut down. My parents were part of the first test, back when we had to ration for the long nights of ash."

"I remember learning about that from a friend. I was too young to remember and my parents never wanted to talk about it."

"All the farmers were working their hardest for the few days we had until the ash swallowed the sky. Then they cursed the air and covered their houses like the rest of us. They got the same rations as the rest of us of course, but you could see that they were crushed."

"We are a proud bunch. When the steam lines and electric rails were coming up, we held on to tradition. There's a certain sense with crops that farmers have. No machine could ever copy it."

"I beliieve it. I've seen it myself."

I reached for his shoulders under a thin, tightly woven tunic that he usually wore under his medical aprons. It reached for comfort more than for attention.

"Kipnu... What do you know about Fajro?" I asked.

"That man who was just here?"

"Yes. I met him on the train today."

"I've never seen him before."

"What? But he's a patient of yours?"

"I've never met that man in my life."

The truth of his deception had finally come to me, but by now it was far too late. I had been a puppet all this time, a passing tool in some political game I didn't want to be a part of.

"Liffa. What's wrong?" he asked, seeing the blank look on my face.

"Fajro got me into the senate because he used to be a fidelant for Holrag. But earlier when I met him on the train, he told me that you were his doctor. "

"So he set all of this up? How did he know to find you?"

"I don't know... Maybe Jathi? No..."

"I'll talk to him. Get to the bottom of this."

"No... Don't bring Jathi into this. I don't think it was him."

"What's his angle?" he asked.

"Apparently he didn't get along with Melna. Maybe it's to get back at her. And his offer is suspiciously generous. I think he needs me but I don't know what for."

"If that guy lays a hand on you–"

"No. That's too simple, too risky. He could use me as a bargaining chip against her though. Get what he wants out of Heiko for a La'To."

"He would need you for longer than that to get anything out of it. And Melna could simply push the story to the news wire if she wanted to kill his leverage. What do you make of this observational study? I thought Heiko had the best observatory."

"Maybe it has something to do with their space rail. Maybe they can send telescopes after all. But..."

Kipnu's face froze and looked worried all of a sudden. "No... they wouldn't."

"Wouldn't? Wouldn't what?" I asked, but it was too late. Fajro and the magistrate had lost patience and re-entered the room.

The magistrate announced to us with his casual voice, "I'd love to stand and chat in the dark with all of you, but I've got 13 cases to cover today. Are you ready to continue?"

I glanced at Kipnu, who was trying his best not to let his rage show on his face.

I answered the magistrate, "I'd like to ask Fajro about the study he's conducting."

"Why sure," Fajro said with a smile.

"Make it quick," said the magistrate, audibly annoyed, and he stepped back to observe.

"What is the goal of this project?"

"Well, it's a continuation of the space rail project. I can't really talk about it without a guarantee of your cooperation. Provincial secrets."

"What do you need me for?"

"Like I said before, you would be a communications liaison between The Heikoi and Holragi scientists."

"I'm not much of a talker, and your Holragi accent isn't thick. What do you _really_ need me for?"

He sighed and looked at the lantern light against the dusty ground.

"Liffa, you don't miss a thing do you. That's one of the reasons I think you'd be a good candidate for the job. The candidates we're looking for have to be lightweight, agile, observant, quick-learning, brave, and in great physical shape. They also need to be willing to take the risk."

"Risk? What risk?"

Our eyes met and he looked at me intently. "We need you up there, Liffa."

In my flood of imagination, I finally saw the dream that he saw. The danger, the pride. The whole planet. _I could die. I could die!_ I shouted inside my head.

Meanwhile, Kipnu had grown impatient. He grabbed Fajro by his tunic and got in his face.

"That's a death sentence, you piece of shit."

"Kipnu. Stop this," the magistrate tried to push Kipnu away, but wasn't succeeding.

"Kipnu," I tried to calm him, but he didn't hear me.

He pushed Fajro and held him against the wall, with Fajro letting out a cry of pain as his head batted against the stone.

"You think you can prey on my family, punk?" He tightened his grip on Fajro's shirt. "Find someone else to murder. Liffa is staying here."

"Kipnu. This is ridiculous. Stop this immediately." The magistrate shouted, and Kipnu backed down. Fajro collapsed to the floor with a hand behind his head, and passed out. The magistrate rushed over to check on him.

"He's breathing, but unconscious. Kipnu, what were you thinking?"

Kipnu wasn't amused, "Oh come on. He's faking it," but was growing unsure. He walked slowly over to the magistrate, who was now anxious being around him, and checked Fajro's vitals. He was unconscious.

The magistrate turned to me and quickly said, "Liffa, let's return to this after we come back," while he grabbed Kipnu by the arm and took him to the outer room.

_Kip, what have you done?_

"Fajro?" I called. He didn't answer.

I stared at his sleeping face. It was wrinkled with the smiles of the past. _Were they genuine? Are you simply misunderstood?_.

The magistrate came back in with a strong-scented cloth and some water in a small bowl.

"He's still unconscious," I said.

"Yes, and he might be after that scene. What was Kipnu thinking?"

"He gets very protective sometimes."

The magistrate dipped the cloth into the bowl and placed it on his lips. Fajro's lips started to move and then purse, and then he woke in a daze.

"Wha. Wha," he panted through broken questions.

"You passed out, Fajro," said the magistrate in a calming voice.

"My head? Wha-"

"It's a bruise, Fajro. Nothing major."

"Kipnu. What happened?"

"Just rest. He's gone now."

I felt no pity for Fajro. My mind was focused on Kipnu.

He sipped some of the water and sat up, motioning to the magistrate for the cloth. The magistrate handed it over and he put it behind his head.

"How are you feeling, Fajro?" asked the magistrate.

"I'll be ok."

"I'm going to have to leave. I'll take Kipnu with me. Are you going to be alright?"

"Yea I'll be fine."

I asked the magistrate, "What's going to happen to Kipnu?"

He stood up and walked over to me.

"He assaulted Fajro and interrupted his consciousness. He'll receive justice for -"

"Just tell me straight."

"He's going to Ulukoma."

My heart sank. _Dammit, you fool._.

He turned to walk out the door and said to me, "I'm going to handle Kipnu's case and I'll be right back again. Don't go anywhere," he said while walking out the door.

Fajro and I sat in silence for a few va'ka, staring everywhere but at each other. A feeling of guilt and embarrassment pervaded me. I acknowledged the senselessness of feeling self-aware about something I hadn't done, but it sustained nonetheless. There were qualities about the gray stone walls that I hadn't noticed without the lanterns. Deep chisel markings and pits where the stone's roughness hadn't been softened yet. What an enormous endeavor it must have been to carve this city by hand. To know that you would never reap all of its benefits, but add your effort anyway. Our whole society was founded on the glorification of works for the greater good, but Kipnu had found something more important. Perhaps he is also doing the right thing.

"Your boy is strong," Fajro said to break the silence. I mended it.

"He takes care of his body, I can tell. Maybe he should take care of his mind too."

He took a swatch of fabric from a pocket in his trousers and blotted his head with it.

"I guess he's not a fan of the idea, then," he said.

"You lied to me, Fajro. And you planned the lie before we even met. I have no reason to trust you, and all the more reason to assume that nothing you say is trustworthy. All of your plans seem to weave together in your favor a little too well."

"I don't blame you. Us fidelants learn to think a certain way. We tend to treat words as incantations more than expressions. They do what we want them to."

"Why are you doing any of this? What paradise awaits you at the end of all this?"

"Oh don't mistake me. I might be a good liar, but I don't do it for the pleasure."

"Then why?"

"This project. It's the only way our species can survive."

"What do you mean?"

"This obstruction – the obscura. Whatever it is, it's hostile. Whoever is controlling it will not stop until Palinan goes permanently dark. You read it yourself. We need you to understand what this thing is so we can stop it from blotting us out completely."

"And what makes you think we can do that?"

"You think we built a space rail with dumb luck? It took negotiation and compromise to bring together the best minds in all the world. We learned everything we could from them and then we made breakthroughs with our knowledge of electricity and metals. We sent countless test ships into space. Many of them orbited and then softly landed on their own with timers. We had space travel down to a science by the sweat and the grit of tens of thousands people."

"-and the blood of hundreds," I showed him that I knew of his reputation.

"Great things take great sacrifice, it is true. But the Heikoi were too simple-minded to see this. By the time we'd made things better, they left the deal."

"And you're still bitter about it."

"There is so much we still don't know about space. Nobody knows what's up there, in the great beyond. I came to Heiko to work with your observers, to discover new things about the universe we live in, but they just wanted to track the same information they had been tracking forever. And now this... obscura, as your observers call it. We're huddling in the dark with no plan. We could have been so far ahead of these invaders by now, but politics got in the way."

"So you're just doing this to prove you were right all along. And I'm your Heikoi hero for all the PR."

"Liffa, none of our feelings or policies or quarrels matter if we're all dead. I know that our project is the only way to survive, and I'm using what skills I have to recruit the people we need."

The argumentation side of my brain went quiet. He was right. Even if we were enemies now, it wouldn't matter once we're all freezing and starving to death.

"Is it dangerous?" I asked.

"Of course it is"

"...Does it hurt?"

"What, space?" he laughed. "I suppose you haven't learned what it's like. Imagine a place with no ground; no trees no ocean; no up or down, no sound at all. Just you, Ara, and infinite darkness. That's space."

I struggled to comprehend what that was like, but I didn't have much time until the door opened again.

"Fajro, how are you holding up," the magistrate asked.

"Fine, sir, fine."

He went over to Fajro to check on his head.

"You still look a bit pale, but you're getting better. Let me finish with Liffa, and then we'll get you somewhere we can look closer at your injuries."

"Thank you, magistrate."

The magistrate stood up and moved closer to me.

"Liffa, I realized that I might have been a bit too hasty in my decision to switch the sentence. I've decided to let you choose where to go. Does that sound fair?"

I answered, "Yes, magistrate. It's a generous offer."

"In that case, I'll continue where I left off."

He re-assumed his regal pose with paper and charcoal in hand, and cleared his throat in preparation.

"Liffa Um Heiko. I find you guilty of interruption of the senate during its deliberation. The sentence shall be a period of three la'tova on Ulukoma _or_ a period of one la'tova under the command of Fajro Um Holrag. Do you understand?"

"I do."

"Then I await your decision within the next tova'la. I will be back to -"

"Magistrate, I've already made my decision."

"You have?"

_I'm sorry, Melna._

"I'm going to Holrag."
