## Chapter 7

"Do you hear it? The ziyu..."

I looked up and saw my mother. Hae clay-smudged skin was illuminated by the low Ara-light of morning, and the leaves on the ziyu above us.

"The wind. It speaks," thi said.

"And we listen through the silence," I said.

Hae skin felt cold and fragile, like parched clay. Thi smiled down at me, and her hands began to disintegrate into the breeze.

"Listen," thi whispered, hae voice now indistinguishable from the wind.

"Mama, Where are you going?!" I called for hae to stay but thi kept slipping through my fingers, hae body sublimating into a cloud as if it were never there. The dewy breeze picked up and the tree began to sing all around me and I listened – closer than I'd listened before.

"What am I listening for, mama?

"Listen," said the breeze.

The whole world began to fade to darkess as the dream melted away and I slowly came back to reality. The room was dark save for a small window that faced toward another wall with just a hint of Ara-light coming in from above. I touched the bruises from Tinpo's grip on my arm, still tender to the touch, and recalled his harsh voice as he locked me in this place. My cheek was caked with dust from the floor I'd been sleeping on, affixed there by the sweat and grief I'd spilled before sleep took me away from all this. I'd have bathed in a trickle of water if I'd been afforded such a luxury.

The tiniest sounds were reverberating off the walls: a short breeze through the window, a little milta scurrying about in search of food, and the buzz of thoughts running through my head. I had prepared myself for Ulukoma, but not for the gnawing anxiety of sitting in a cell alone. The time was strewn together like a trance or a prayer, and I wondered if all this silence was meant to break the prisoner's perception of right and wrong before they were even spoken to. I wondered if the senate would believe Melna. If they would ridicule her for what I'd done. And where was the man who helped me? My accomplice, Fajro? Would he come to vouch for me as he'd promised?

<!--
- Liffa, Fajro, and the Magistrate are meeting
- Melna is stuck late in deliberation and so she can't come
-->

A door opened in the next room, waking me from the droning fog of a daydream. Two men were continuing a conversation as they moved through the room and I listened intently to their muffled voices. Their tone and dialect were unfamiliar to me, but I'd already learned not to trust my own ears outside of Heiko. Their voices approached the door of my room and it opened it with a mechanical clink. Their footsteps began to ring off the gray stone walls and I stood up to see the first figure, a man who was somewhere between young and old, robed in gray, with a face cast orange by the lantern he held in his hand. The other stood at length in the dark, but I could tell by his silver cane that it was Fajro.

"Liffa, we've come to pay you a visit," said the robed man. He gifted me a genuine smile, the first I'd seen since leaving Heiko, and it set me at ease for the moment. "Hope we didn't wake you."

"N-No, not at all," I stammered. I instinctively put my hands on my belly.

"I'm Sunte, and I'll be the magistrate for your case." He put his hands behind his back to reveal the red sash of Shaki legalists at his waist. "You were told that I would be here, no?"

I hesitated, trying to remember. "The guard... Tinpo. He said you would be here in the morning."

"Ah. I see. I hope this doesn't come as a shock to you, but we are... in the mist of the morning."

I felt disoriented. How could it be morning already? The magistrate saw the bewildered expression on my face and said, "We can come back once you're ready."

"No, No, I'm fine," I said. "I just...I can't believe it."

"The stay in these cells can be rather disorienting," he said. "This tiny window doesn't let much light through. Hard to tell the color of Ara."

I could see the confidence in his posture and facial expression that his lifetime of experience in law must have given him. I grew curious. "You are... a magistrate?" I asked him. "Are all magistrates so nice?"

He laughed and said "I find these things go smoother when I'm not judging you from my shining pedestal on high. We all do strange things. Whether we feel convinced it's the right thing, or a fit of anger compelled us. I'm not here to judge you personally. I'm just here to translate the law as it pertains to you."

I would have liked to say something more eloquent than "Thank you", but that is unfortunately the chain of words that my tongue had decided to express. The extent of my exhaustion had become awkwardly clear, but thankfully he changed the subject.

"How are you feeling?" he asked. "Do you need anything before we begin?"

"I want to talk to Melna," I said.

Fajro interrupted, "The senate has been in deliberation all night about the message you delivered. They've had a few breaks for rest and administration, but they're still debating this very moment. Melna won't be able to come here for a while."

"They didn't sleep?" I asked.

The magistrate spoke again with his calming voice, "I would love to wait until Melna is ready, but we don't yet know when that will happen."

"Then I'll wait," I said, walking away. "I can wait here for her."

He wore a pitied look. "I'm sorry Liffa. The law permits me but a day for a case like yours. Perhaps there's someone else who you'd like as a advocate?"

I looked at Fajro, and he gave me a nod of trust. Perhaps he really was true to his word.

"No," I said. "Fajro will be sufficient."

"Very good," said the magistrate. "Now then, shall we?"

He cleared his throat, and began in a pronounced and regal tone. "Liffa Um Heiko, you have been charged with corruption of consciousness and interruption of the senate during its deliberation. Do you understand?"

I hesitated, wondering why he was asking a rhetorical question at such a time. But he was patient and waited for me to respond on my own. "Y-Yes," I said.

"As an instrument of the law, I am compelled to question every detail, that all the facts of a matter may see the light of Ara. Do you understand?"

"Yes."

"As an instrument of justice, it is my duty to decide a punishment that fits the facts. Do you understand?"

"I do."

He broke his regal posture into a more casual stance and said, "So, now I just need to ask you some questions about yesterday, and make sure they check out with what I've heard from others. Answer what you can, but if you don't remember or don't know something, simply say so and I won't push any further. If at any time you feel compelled or overwhelmed you can refuse to answer, but remember that this is your opportunity to plead your version of the story. I cannot change the law, nor can I change the past, but I can reduce the severity of your punishment."

I was a bit confused by the ceremony of it all, but I stammered an "Okay" anyway, hoping to be done with all this questioning. He hung his lantern up on a thick steel peg that was hiding in the shadows and produced a small slab of marble with a leaf of paper affixed to it, and a well-used charcoal-ink pen from a small case tied around his wrist.

"Let's begin with the main question at hand. Did you do it?"

I paused, wondering if his question was a joke. "There were hundreds of witnesses. I couldn't lie my way out of that if I wanted to."

He smiled and said, "I'm just ensuring common ground, that's all. Now, tell me what led you to the interruption. What was the initial spark for all this?"

"I had to announce some news," I said.

He started to write on his paper. "It couldn't wait until after deliberation?" he asked as he finished his writing.

"It was urgent," I explained. "I had to get it out before they adjourned and left for the day."

"Did you try asking anyone for help?"

"I did," I said. "I asked Melna's assistant Pomri from the conduit in Heiko."

"And what happened?"

"She declined to help. She didn't want to be sent to Ulukoma."

I looked toward him, saw the warmth in his eyes despite his calculated words. There was no judgment in them, just observation. I'd never spoken to someone who was so attentive, or so charmingly intimidating. An affable paradox.

He finished jotting his notes and then turned the page for the next question. "How did you come upon this news?" he asked.

"An observer in Heiko intended for a message to be delivered to Melna in the morning. But she was gone when he tried to deliver it."

"Melna? As in žah-Melna, the Heiko fidelant?"

"Yes."

"And you were there when they showed up?"

"Ah, yes. Melna is my jundwoman," I said.

"I see," he said, scribbling his notes quicker now. "And then?"

"The observer and I went to the conduit and we spoke to Pomri who refused us. We talked about what to do, and then... I volunteered to deliver it."

"Did you know what you were delivering at the time?" he asked.

"Well, no, but I trusted them," I said. I pondered showing my badge, to show him that my trust was not misplaced. But I wanted to keep the observatory out of it. "It was imperative that they continue their work and I was available."

"Were you being coerced or blackmailed?" he asked plainly.

"No!" I said, surprised. "Absolutely not! They're my friends. They would never do such a thing to me!"

He smiled as he wrote. "I just needed to check, that's all," he said. He turned the page again with a deep breath. "So that leads to my next question: how did you get into the deliberation hall?"

I thought of glancing at Fajro to ask for help or a sign, but the magistrate's all-seeing eyes were so apparent that I was afraid he would see even the faintest of movements. So I looked squarely at Sunte and told him the truth. "I was helping a disabled man who was traveling to the senate."

"Do you have a name?"

I was taken aback. "Don't you know already?" I asked.

The magistrate was amused. "I may, I may not," he said. "I have neither the inclination nor the liberty to say. My questions are simply a way for me to understand you."

"I see," I said. In a frantic hesitation, I tried to manufacture a name so as not to incriminate the one person who could bring an end to this mess, but my mind had frozen in time with the magistrate's eye upon me.

Fajro interrupted. "Your piety," he said. "It's quite stressful for the maman to be asked to reveal the name of a... close friend. Perhaps we should move to another question and revisit this later."

The magistrate turned to face the ex-fidelant and looked him in the eye. There was a moment of understanding, and perhaps hostility between the two of them as they stared at each other for a brief moment. "No need," he said quietly, almost submissively. "I think I have the facts I was looking for." He folded the paper into an inner pocket of his robe and glanced at me, unable to look me in the eye. "I'll be back shortly for your sentencing," he said as he hurried toward the door. I wondered what unspoken words had been exchanged between them.

Fajro hollered behind him, "Don't take too long, now. Our brave messenger from Heiko deserves better."

The magistrate held the door open for a moment, no longer observing but thinking deeply, as if his all-seeing eyes had turned inward and saw nothing but darkness. "Yes, of course," he said, and he passed through the door as it seemed to close gently under its own weight.

<!--  Fajro gives the offer -->

"Quite an agreeable man, Sunte," said Fajro. "With a keen eye and a sharp mind. He'd do well as an observer, wouldn't you say?"

"Maybe," I replied. "I-I'm not sure."

"But aren't you?" he said, in a puzzling way.

"Listen, I need your help," I said, focusing on the subject at hand. "I don't want to go to Ulukoma."

"My help?" he laughed. "As I recall, you said you could survive Ulukoma just fine without my help."

"I've changed my mind. After seeing Melna react the way she did... I need to be here, with my family."

He looked toward the small window facing the wall and looked slightly upward at nothing in particular. "The law is the law," he said. "I cannot stop the magistrate from handing down a punishment."

I pleaded to him, "There must be another way, I–"

"-But... perhaps an alternative arrangement can be made."

"What sort of arrangement?" I asked him.

He broke from his trance and walked toward me. "If you are inclined, you could come with me to Holrag for a few days, then you can head back home to Heiko."

"I am not inclined," I said.

"Perhaps I can change your inclination. You see, the world has changed overnight ever since you delivered that tiny slip of paper, and people are scrambling for answers. But the one question they can't answer is what this obscura is. I want you to answer it for them."

"Me? What use could a farmer be to a problem like that?"

"A farmer? Worthless. But you're more than that aren't you? I know that you were once an observer, and a good one at that, but you gave up your dream to pick up the farm where you mother left it. Honorable, but such a waste of talent."

I was aghast. How could he possibly know so much about me?

"I've seen the haw on your eyes, the tone of your skin. The blood of the Holragi is in your veins. It's been calling to you since you were born. You studied with the observers because you imagined your own _nul sa'am_[^2] to Ara. I want you to go on the journey that you've been waiting for your whole life: to be the first throngia to traverse the Ara line."

[^2]: The tribes of Holragi constantly migrate across the vast lands of Holrag in a cycle, sharing permanent structures amongst them. Nul sa'am is a Holragi term for a lone journey outside of one's tribe.

A chill flowed through my veins as he told my dreams back to me as if he'd known me my whole life. I had wanted nothing more than to travel to the sky since the day I was born. But not now, not like this. There was a sense of mistrust for Fajro that was brewing deep within me. Everything was too perfect, too convenient for coincidence. I needed assurance that I wasn't a tool for some other end.

"That's a suicide mission," I said. "What if the obscura is hostile or armed? It could be something we can't even fathom."

He responded as if he'd rehearsed the answer. "As we speak, we are preparing to send an empty capsule to see how the obscura reacts to it. We wouldn't dare send a living thing until we know for sure what would happen."

But I was still apprehensive. "And if it does get destroyed, you would have me sit around twiddling my thumbs for a few days? I find that hard to believe."

"Think of it this way," he explained. "If something were to harm you under my watch – the Heiko fidelant's maman, the selfless hero-messenger – it would be a disaster for our entire project, for all the tribes of Holrag. You will be in safe hands. A few days making a name for yourself is surely better than spending your precious time in Ulukoma."

"But what am I to you? Why can't you send one of your own?"

"I told you before. All of our candidates pulled out of the program."

"There is surely at least one person in the whole world both willing and capable."

"You have a very unique set of traits. You're lightweight, agile, observant, quick-learning, and strong as a full-grown saffa. But most importantly, you understand how important the obscura is. That the future of our people lies far beyond this planet. You know that you belong there."

I withdrew and faced the wall behind me. The room felt much smaller with an impatient question hanging in the air. It surrounded me, stifled my thoughts, demanded an answer. I imagined flying up there in that dark blue void, trying to observe and communicate with some machination that no one had encountered before. I saw the dream that Fajro saw: not just preventing our own extinction, but unlocking our understanding of what's really waiting for us out there. A dream so big that it could be the death of me, alone in a small room in an empty sea. _I could die. I could die!_

<!-- Kipnu barges in and roughs Fajro up -->

A new voice entered the other room: a man, agitated and moving about. I heard some shuffling of feet, and some failed attempts by the magistrate to calm him down. The man to the door and identified himself by my name. "Liffa!" Kipnu yelled for me.

I ran to the door to feel his presence though I didn't say a word out of fear for his safety. I wanted him to leave before he made any rash decisions. The door rattled under his strength as he said my name again. He knew that I was here, and he wasn't going to leave until he saw me.

"Kipnu!" I yelled through the door. "What are you doing? Get out of here!"

Fajro stirred, uneasy at the sound of his name. "Your jundman?" he asked. "What's gotten into him?"

There were sounds of shuffling and shouting as the magistrate fled to call for help. I backed away from the door, anticipating some movement, and with a sudden clink the door flung wide and brought Kipnu into the holding cell. I ran into his arms, his warmth, and he held me in a way that I so desperately needed.

The magistrate barged in after him. "You're in corruption of a hearing," he said. "I urge you to leave, or you'll be put in a cell yourself."

But Kipnu wouldn't move an inch. "Liffa needs an advocate," said Kipnu. "You're not administering the law without an advocate for the accused."

"Liffa already has advocate," said the magistrate. "Now please remove yourself from this place."

Kipnu's hands dropped from my arms as he looked back at the magistrate with suspicious eyes. "Who?" he asked. The magistrate looked past him toward the window, and he turned around to look the same way. His eyes spotted Fajro's silhouette in a dark corner near the window, seeming to hide from view. "You claim to advocate for Liffa," Kipnu said. "Then show yourself."

The magistrate moved to stop Kipnu from advancing, but Fajro held his hands up calmly as he stepped into the light. "Kipnu," said Fajro. "Lovely to meet your acquaintence."

Kipnu turned to me in confusion. "Who is this?"

"You... you met him today," I said. "He told me that he came to–"

Fajro butted in, "–Alas, I didn't have time to meet the greatest physician in all of Heiko. There was a much more pressing matter to attend to at the senate."

"How do you know Liffa?" Kipnu asked him.

"I did not know hae before yesterday. But kismet has a tendency to bring strangers together in serendipitous ways."

"You had a hand in this, didn't you?" Kipnu surmised. "Did he put you up to this?" he asked me without turning his eyes.

Fajro paused with a deep breath and began to pace around the lamplight. "A hand? No. Liffa understood that hae message had to be delivered for the greater good of the world and thi took a sacrifice no one else around hae was willing to take. I did not coerce hae; thi had already done that for haeself. My role was to calm hae spirits and ease hae journey. And now I've come to lend my help again."

"Is that true?" he asked me, but my confidence in the truth had eroded. I stared at him, unable to prouce an answer. He turned back to Fajro. "What help you've already given has landed hae here. There is no more need for you."

"Oh I beg to differ," Fajro retorted. "Magistrate, I presume you've reached a sentencing decision."

Kipnu turned back to the magistrate who stood behind us with an uncomfortable look about him.

"Y-Yes, sir," said the magistrate as he entered the room again. He looked at both Kipnu and Fajro as if to glean some prediction, his sharp eyes were now mired in worry. He began, "The senate has delivered a message regarding Liffa's sentence. It shall be hae choice between two paths. One: to send away to Ulukoma for a period of twenty days. Two: to send away to Holrag under the care of Fajro um Holrag for a period of three days."

_How did Fajro know before the magistrate?_

Kipnu rushed toward Fajro and held him against the wall with a terrifying look in his eyes. Fajro let out a cry of pain as his head hit the stone. "You think I'm not onto you?"

"This is absurd. Stop this immediately!" The magistrate shouted.

But Kipnu tightened his grip on Fajro's shirt. "Find someone else to mess with," he said. "Liffa is staying here."

"Kip," I uttered in a broken voice. He let go and Fajro collapsed to the floor while the magistrate rushed over to check on him.

"He's breathing, but unconscious," said the magistrate. "What were you thinking?"

Kipnu looked back at them, his anger turning to concern. He knew there was no going back; that he'd damned himself to the dark island.

The magistrate turned to me and said, "I'll return shortly. Keep an eye on him." He grabbed Kipnu by the arm and dragged him back through the doorway he'd barged through, leaving it ajar. I peeked my head out of the doorway and watched as they retreated down a long hallway and into another room.

_Kip, what have you done?_

<!-- Fajro uses the alone time to convince Liffa that he alone can save Kip from Ulukoma. Liffa considers going to Ulukoma to be with Kip, but wants both of them to avoid it. -->

"Fajro?" I called. He didn't answer.

I stared at his sleeping face. It was wrinkled with the smiles of the past. _Were they genuine? Are you simply misunderstood?_.

The magistrate came back in with a strong-scented cloth and some water in a small bowl.

"He's still unconscious," I said.

"Yes, and he might be after that scene. What was Kipnu thinking?"

"He gets very protective sometimes."

The magistrate dipped the cloth into the bowl and placed it on his lips. Fajro's lips started to move and then purse, and then he woke in a daze.

"Wha. Wha," he panted through broken questions.

"You passed out, Fajro," said the magistrate in a calming voice.

"My head? Wha-"

"It's a bruise, Fajro. Nothing major."

"Kipnu. What happened?"

"Just rest. He's gone now."

I felt no pity for Fajro. My mind was focused on Kipnu.

He sipped some of the water and sat up, motioning to the magistrate for the cloth. The magistrate handed it over and he put it behind his head.

"How are you feeling, Fajro?" asked the magistrate.

"I'll be ok."

"I'm going to deal with Kipnu. I'll send for a doctor right away."

"No. No need. I'll be fine."

I asked the magistrate, "What's going to happen to Kipnu?"

He stood up and walked over to me.

"He assaulted Fajro and interrupted his consciousness. He'll receive justice for his crimes."

"Just tell me."

"He's going to Ulukoma."

My heart sank. _Dammit, you fool._

He turned to walk out the door and said to me, "I'm going to handle Kipnu's case and I'll be right back again. Don't go anywhere," he said while walking out the door.

<!-- left off -->

"Gentlemen, let's give hae a moment," said the magistrate in a humbled tone.

I rushed to turn around. "Wait, Kipnu," I said. "Stay with me. Just you."

The others gathered their lanterns and moved to the other room, the magistrate wrapping his arm around Fajro to help. I walked toward Kipnu but didn't reach for him this time.

"How many people know?" I asked him.

"Only the senate," he said. "Melna told me it's up to each province to decide that for itself. The governor of Heiko has decided to reveal by hierarchy."

"What's that?"

"In order to stave off panic, people are told one-by-one in private rooms and are given tasks to help so they don't just mentally shut down. My parents were part of the first test, back when we had to ration for the long nights of ash."

"I remember learning about that from a friend. I was too young to remember and my parents never wanted to talk about it."

"All the farmers were working their hardest for the few days we had until the ash swallowed the sky. Then they cursed the air and covered their houses like the rest of us. They got the same rations as the rest of us of course, but you could see that they were crushed."

"We are a proud bunch. When the steam lines and electric rails were coming up, we held on to tradition. There's a certain sense with crops that farmers have. No machine could ever copy it."

"I believe it. I've seen it myself."

I reached for his shoulders under a thin, tightly woven tunic that he usually wore under his medical aprons. It reached for comfort more than for attention.

"Kipnu... What do you know about Fajro?" I asked.

"That man who was just here?"

"Yes. I met him on the train today."

"I've never seen him before."

"What? But he's a patient of yours?"

"I've never met that man in my life."

The truth of his deception had finally come to me, but by now it was far too late. I had been a puppet all this time, a passing tool in some political game I didn't want to be a part of.

"Liffa. What's wrong?" he asked, seeing the blank look on my face.

"Fajro got me into the senate because he used to be a fidelant for Holrag. But earlier when I met him on the train, he told me that you were his doctor. "

"So he set all of this up? How did he know to find you?"

"I don't know... Maybe Jathi? No..."

"I'll talk to him. Get to the bottom of this."

"No... Don't bring Jathi into this. I don't think it was him."

"What's his angle?" he asked.

"Apparently he didn't get along with Melna. Maybe it's to get back at her. And his offer is suspiciously generous. I think he needs me but I don't know what for."

"If that guy lays a hand on you–"

"No. That's too simple, too risky. He could use me as a bargaining chip against her though. Get what he wants out of Heiko for a La'To."

"He would need you for longer than that to get anything out of it. And Melna could simply push the story to the news wire if she wanted to kill his leverage. What do you make of this observational study? I thought Heiko had the best observatory."

"Maybe it has something to do with their space rail. Maybe they can send telescopes after all. But..."

Kipnu's face froze and looked worried all of a sudden. "No... they wouldn't."

"Wouldn't? Wouldn't what?" I asked, but it was too late. Fajro and the magistrate had lost patience and re-entered the room.

The magistrate announced to us with his casual voice, "I'd love to stand and chat in the dark with all of you, but I've got 13 cases to cover today. Are you ready to continue?"

I glanced at Kipnu, who was trying his best not to let his rage show on his face.

I answered the magistrate, "I'd like to ask Fajro about the study he's conducting."

"Why sure," Fajro said with a smile.

"Make it quick," said the magistrate, audibly annoyed, and he stepped back to observe.

"What is the goal of this project?"

"Well, it's a continuation of the space rail project. I can't really talk about it without a guarantee of your cooperation. Provincial secrets."

"What do you need me for?"

"Like I said before, you would be a communications liaison between The Heikoi and Holragi scientists."

"I'm not much of a talker, and your Holragi accent isn't thick. What do you _really_ need me for?"

He sighed and looked at the lantern light against the dusty ground.

"Liffa, you don't miss a thing do you. That's one of the reasons I think you'd be a good candidate for the job. They also need to be willing to take the risk."

"Risk? What risk?"

Our eyes met and he looked at me intently. "We need you up there, Liffa."

<!-- Liffa is sentenced -->

"Ok, I have to get all formal again, now."

He took the lantern in his hand and assumed his regal pose. It made me nervous even though it seemed silly.

"Liffa Um Heiko, I have gathered as many facts as I could and have reached a conclusion. I find you innocent of corruption of consciousness under the codex of Palinan and absolve you of all accusations of such claim."

I felt a slight relief, but knew the other was inescapable.

"However, the codex of the senate makes clear that any interruption of any kind during deliberation is illegal. For this reason, I find you guilty of interruption of the senate during its deliberation."

The conviction was expected, but it still hurt.

"The sentence shall be a period of thirty days in Ulukoma. Do you understa-"

The door opened in a rush, and the magistrate paused to see who caused the disturbance. Two lanterns were in view.

"Fajro? What are you doing here?" the magistrate asked.

I was thinking the same thing, but I quickly changed my mind when I saw the other face.

"Kipnu! You came!" I shouted.

He rushed to me and reached for my face with his free hand. Fajro walked in his slower pace toward us and attempted to bow to the magistrate.

"Oh there isn't any need of that," the magistrate said.

"Pardon my old habits. They've taken a permanent residence with me." He responded.

He reached the other side of Kipnu and looked closely at me, trying to telegraph something but I did not know what.

"I hope we came in time to defend Liffa," he said.

The magistrate responded, "Well, it's a little bit late, but I'll permit it if you have something to say worth adding."

The magistrate turned to me and asked, "Liffa, do you approve of Fajro's testimony?"

"Only if Kipnu is allowed to speak as well."

"Yes, that would be fine."

The magistrate took his paper and charcoal out again and turned to Fajro, motioning for him to speak.

Fajro began, "Liffa was helping me walk. I intended to interrupt the senate myself, and unwittingly inspired hae to finish the job when I was stopped by guards."

I was aghast. He was taking the blame? For what?

The magistrate stopped writing and laid his forehead into his hand. "That's quite a thing to admit, Fajro, but Liffa was still the one who actually interrupted the deliberation."

He replied, "I understand. My only hope for my testimony is that you give a lighter sentence to a maman who was acting under my orders."

"Well, the codex of the senate has pretty clear guidelines on sentencing for interruption. I would be risking my post if I let hae free without punishment."

Kipnu turned to the magistrate and pleaded to him, "Please sir. Liffa had every positive intention. Thi doesn't deserve to be shipped off."

<!-- kipnu gets angry -->

Meanwhile, Kipnu had grown impatient. He grabbed Fajro by his tunic and got in his face.

"That's a death sentence, you piece of shit."

<!-- Fajro convinces Liffa again -->

Fajro and I sat in silence for a few moments, staring everywhere but at each other. A feeling of guilt and embarrassment pervaded me. I acknowledged the senselessness of feeling self-aware about something I hadn't done, but it sustained nonetheless. There were qualities about the gray stone walls that I hadn't noticed without the lanterns. Deep chisel markings and pits where the stone's roughness hadn't been softened yet. What an enormous endeavor it must have been to carve this city by hand. To know that you would never reap all of its benefits, but add your effort anyway. Our whole society was founded on the glorification of works for the greater good, but Kipnu had found something more important. Perhaps he is also doing the right thing.

"Your boy is strong," Fajro said to break the silence. I mended it.

"He takes care of his body, I can tell. Maybe he should take care of his mind too."

He took a swatch of fabric from a pocket in his trousers and blotted his head with it.

"I guess he's not a fan of the idea, then," he said.

"You lied to me, Fajro. And you planned the lie before we even met. I have no reason to trust you, and all the more reason to assume that nothing you say is trustworthy. All of your plans seem to weave together in your favor a little too well."

"I don't blame you. Us fidelants learn to think a certain way. We tend to treat words as incantations more than expressions. They do what we want them to."

"Why are you doing any of this? What paradise awaits you at the end of all this?"

"Oh don't mistake me. I might be a good liar, but I don't do it for the pleasure."

"Then why?"

"This project. It's the only way our species can survive."

"What do you mean?"

"This obstruction – the obscura. Whatever it is, it's hostile. Whoever is controlling it will not stop until Palinan goes permanently dark. You read it yourself. We need you to understand what this thing is so we can stop it from blotting us out completely."

"And what makes you think we can do that?"

"You think we built a space rail with dumb luck? It took negotiation and compromise to bring together the best minds in all the world. We learned everything we could from them and then we made breakthroughs with our knowledge of electricity and metals. We sent countless test ships into space. Many of them orbited and then softly landed on their own with timers. We had space travel down to a science by the sweat and the grit of tens of thousands people."

"-and the blood of hundreds," I showed him that I knew of his reputation.

"Great things take great sacrifice, it is true. But the Heikoi were too simple-minded to see this. By the time we'd made things better, they left the deal."

"And you're still bitter about it."

"There is so much we still don't know about space. Nobody knows what's up there, in the great beyond. I came to Heiko to work with your observers, to discover new things about the universe we live in, but they just wanted to track the same information they had been tracking forever. And now this... obscura, as your observers call it. We're huddling in the dark with no plan. We could have been so far ahead of these invaders by now, but politics got in the way."

"So you're just doing this to prove you were right all along. And I'm your Heikoi hero for all the PR."

"Liffa, none of our feelings or policies or quarrels matter if we're all dead. I know that our project is the only way to survive, and I'm using what skills I have to recruit the people we need."

The argumentation side of my brain went quiet. He was right. Even if we were enemies now, it wouldn't matter once we're all freezing and starving to death.

"Is it dangerous?" I asked.

"Of course it is"

"...Does it hurt?"

"What, space?" he laughed. "I suppose you haven't learned what it's like. Imagine a place with no ground; no trees no ocean; no up or down, no sound at all. Just you, Ara, and infinite darkness. That's space."

I struggled to comprehend what that was like, but I didn't have much time until the door opened again.

"Fajro, how are you holding up," the magistrate asked.

"Fine, sir, fine."

He went over to Fajro to check on his head.

"You still look a bit pale, but you're getting better. Let me finish with Liffa, and then we'll get you somewhere we can look closer at your injuries."

"Thank you, magistrate."

The magistrate stood up and moved closer to me.

"Liffa, I realized that I might have been a bit too hasty in my decision to switch the sentence. I've decided to let you choose where to go. Does that sound fair?"

I answered, "Yes, magistrate. It's a generous offer."

"In that case, I'll continue where I left off."

He re-assumed his regal pose with paper and charcoal in hand, and cleared his throat in preparation.

"Liffa Um Heiko. I find you guilty of interruption of the senate during its deliberation. The sentence shall be a period of thirty days on Ulukoma _or_ a period of five days under the command of Fajro Um Holrag. Do you understand?"

"I do."

"Then I await your decision within the next 500 ticks of Ara[^3]. I will be back to -"

[^3]: Clocks on Palinan track divisions of the day in 20,736 "ticks", divided into groups of 12, 144, and 1728. One tick is approximately fifteen Earth seconds.

"Magistrate, I've already made my decision."

"You have?"

_I'm sorry, Melna._

"I'm going to Holrag."

<!--
I kept looking until their faces came into view. It was Melna after all.

I held a hand through the only gap in the wall and I plead to her, "Melna... before you say anything I–"

"Shh...," She took my hands and calmed me with her gentle voice, "Liffa... you did the right thing today."

The watchman left us to return to his post. I stared at her, confused, but then I looked into her eyes. There was a sort of relief there: the kind you get when a great weight of anguish has been liberated from the spirit.

She said, "When I saw you here, I was furious. But when you mentioned the observatory, I realized that you must have been sent by Thimlu and that everything else the senate was deliberating was irrelevant. I read the message to the senate and I told them I had been talking with the observers. Some of them believed me, but others did not."

"Melna, you aren't..."

"Angry at you? No. I'm angry at the senate. The message has swayed its course and it's become difficult to negotiate for Heiko. A fidelant from Holrag accused me of keeping all of this a secret so we could stockpile and profit on the chaos. Now they want Heiko to distribute enough food for all of Palinan to subsist on for 20 days."

"But we only stockpile enough for ourselves for 60 days. And what about their own stockpiles?"

"I know. But we must do this if we are to maintain our position in the senate. We will focus on rebuilding our grain reserves in the steppe."

"The steppe?" I scoffed. "Melna, you can't grow anything out there it's too hot."

"Things will begin to cool quickly. We can no longer grow in the same places. We must keep up with the obscura and move to warmer places."

"And what if the obscura decides to disperse one day while we're stuck out there?"

"We will have starved to death long before that if we don't start growing there."

"No! You can't let them push us around like this!"

"It's not that easy."

"Just refuse their demand!"

"It would risk a war at a time when we can't afford that."

I pounded on the walls and I retreated back into my cell, my arms throbbing from the pain I'd just caused them. Through the ringing in my ears, I heard the heavy beating of my hearts counting each moment as it passed in the depths of this wretched city.

"This senate... These are the people who protect our civilization from destroying each other? A bunch of angry men and women making bets with their people?"

"Liffa... It's complicated."

I paced again. This cell seemed smaller than it was before. I didn't let her see that I was fighting countless compulsions to rattle the door and scream at the top of my lungs. But my mind gave up and pushed me deeper into a depressive mess.

"So... what happens to me now?" I asked in a cracked voice.

"Well, they are unlikely to forego sentencing. A magistrate will visit you tomorrow with whoever wants to plea your case. Then he'll sentence you and take you to wherever that sentence sends you."

"And you'll be there, right?"

"Liffa... if I could–"

"Don't you dare twist your words on me."

She sighed and glanced to the side. "The senate has a special session tomorrow about the obscura. I have to be there to negotiate for Heiko. Otherwise, we'll be hung out to dry."

I took a step back and sighed. "I understand," I said.

"I'll get Kipnu to come. And I'll send a letter to the magistrate in the morning arguing for a lighter sentence."

"Thank you."

"Liffa. If I don't see you before you leave. Remember that I love you. Wherever you go."

I hadn't considered that this might be the last time I see her for a while. "I know your love. I know."

"The three of us are responsible for each other," she said. "I'll be fighting for home to feel like home. So you'll have something to look forward to when you come back."

"And I promise to bring my whole self back as well."

"Promise me, Liffa–"

The door opened again and the sound of broken footsteps caught our ears. They were slow, and intimated a slight limp that made his presence obvious.

"Fajro, what are you doing here?" I called to him.

Melna looked at me with confused and disdainful eyes. "Fajro?! What is that lecherous milta doing here?" she asked in a hushed tone.

I was surprised at Melna's reaction. Before I could explain, he rounded the corner and their eyes met.

"Did you put Liffa up to this?" she asked.

"Absolutely not. This was Liffa's idea."

"My apologies if I seem doubtful, but this is not the sort of idea thi would think of."

"Melna, these are dark times. Thi knows it. Now we all know it. We need more selfless heroes like hae who transcend the law and the bureacracy to do the things that we cannot wait for."

"Surely the untouchable ex-fidelant would make for a better hero."

_Untouchable?_

He scoffed. "You don't become untouchable by bringing attention to yourself, Melna. You know that."

I butted in, "I'm guessing you two have met?"

Melna was quick to snatch the response, "Regrettably, yes."

"Surely you're joking, Melna. Let our squabbles stay in the past where they belong."

"I know your game, Fajro." She didn't hesitate. "We're not playing it."

Fajro leaned back with a serious face now, "We can agree to disagree, but we will get nowhere pointing fingers at each other. The fact of the matter is that we are now in a battle for our lives against an unknown enemy. We must do everything that we can to come together, understand this threat, and fight it back as quickly as we can."

Melna paused to let his words die in the corners of the room.

"You have no business being here," she said. "This decision is between me and Liffa, so I'll ask you once nicely to leave."

"You're being ridiculous Melna, I only–"

"Get out."

He stared at her for a moment, with the same unfazed and perceptive look he always had, and then slowly turned around, slinging a glance my way.

"We'll talk later," he said to me.

Melna turned back to me, and said, "Another lie."

When he had finally closed the door on his way out, Melna came in closer to me and asked me under her breath, "How did you meet Fajro?"

"I met him on the train here. I couldn't have done this without his help."

"Of course. Listen to me, Liffa, that man will do anything it takes to force his will and gain power. He tricked the entire senate into a bad trade deal back when I was a junior fidelant. Heiko and Shaki were stuck donating food and freshwater to some shady mining project in exchange for a rail network. Then when he retired, it was clear that his company used our resources as leverage against the tribes of Holrag just to make his stupid space rail."

"I didn't know..." I said.

"Fajro's words may be sweet, but he is a conniving, manipulative bastard. Do not listen to anything he says."

"But then why would he help me?"

"To embarrass me and lower my status in the senate. Or perhaps he's working some other angle with the senate. Whatever it is you stay away from whatever he's offering, no matter how good he makes it sound. Do you understand?"

"I understand."

Her free hand was holding hard on my shoulder now, and she saw that I was uncomfortable, so she slowly rose her head again and calmed down.

"Good," she said. "I'm sorry I can't be at your hearing tomorrow. I'll send a message to Kipnu to see if he can come instead. Meanwhile you should get some rest."

I felt scared and alone again. "Where are you going?"

"I'm sorry. I have to prepare for tomorrow's session."

"Stay with me. Just for one more minute."

She looked at me for a bit, then hung her lantern on a hook in the wall and held my hand through the hole. This place smelled like piss and rust, but I didn't mind. I chose this woman and she chose me.

"I love you, Liffa. Kipnu would say it too if he were here."

"I know. You're here."

I lifted my head and gazed at her through the hole in the wall.

"I love you too."
