## Chapter 7

"Do you hear it? The ziyu..."

I looked up and saw my mother. Hae clay-smudged skin was illuminated by the low Ara-light of morning, and the leaves on the ziyu above us.

"The wind. It speaks," thi said.

"And we listen through the silence," I said.

Hae skin felt cold and fragile, like parched clay. Thi smiled down at me, and her hands began to disintegrate into the breeze.

"Listen," thi whispered, hae voice now indistinguishable from the wind.

"Mama, Where are you going?!" I called for hae to stay but thi kept slipping through my fingers, hae body sublimating into a cloud as if it were never there. The dewy breeze picked up and the tree began to sing all around me and I listened – closer than I'd listened before.

"What am I listening for, mama?

"Listen," said the breeze.

The whole world began to fade to darkess as the dream melted away and I slowly came back to reality. The room was dark save for a small curtained window on a distant wall that threw an infrared glow across the black marble floor. I touched the bruises from Tinpo's grip on my arm, still tender to the touch, and recalled his harsh voice as he locked me in this place. My cheek was caked with dust from the floor I'd been sleeping on, affixed there by the sweat and grief I'd spilled before sleep took me away from all this. I'd have bathed in a trickle of water if I'd been afforded such a luxury.

The tiniest sounds were reverberating off the walls: a short breeze through the window, a little milta scurrying about in search of food, and the buzz of thoughts running through my head. I had prepared myself for Ulukoma, but not for the gnawing anxiety of sitting in a cell alone. The time was strewn together like a trance or a prayer, and I wondered if all this silence was meant to break the prisoner's perception of right and wrong before they were even spoken to. I wondered if the senate would believe Melna. If they would ridicule her for what I'd done. And where was the man who helped me? My accomplice, Fajro? Would he come to vouch for me as he'd promised?

A door opened in the next room, waking me from the drone of the cell. I heard a man and a woman talking and I listened intently to their muffled voices. Their tone and dialect were unfamiliar to me, but I'd already learned not to trust my own ears outside of Heiko. The two moved toward the door that I could see from my cell and opened it with a mechanical clink. Two pairs of footsteps began to ring off the gray stone walls and I stood up to see the first figure, a man who was somewhere between young and old, robed in gray, with a face cast orange by the lantern he held in his hand. The other stood at length in the dark, but I could tell by his silver cane that it was Fajro.

"Liffa, we've come to pay you a visit," said the robed man. He gifted me a genuine smile, the first I'd seen since leaving Heiko, and it set me at ease for the moment. "Hope we didn't wake you."

"N-No, not at all," I stammered. I instinctively wrapped my arms around my belly.

"I'm Sunte, and I'll be the magistrate for your case." He put his hands behind his back to reveal the red sash of Shaki legalists at his waist. "You were told that I would be here, no?"

I hesitated, trying to remember. "The guard... Tinpo. He said you would be here in the morning."

"Ah. I see. I hope this doesn't come as a shock to you, but we are in the mist of the morning."

I felt disoriented. How could it be morning already?

He continued, "We can come back once you're fully awake."

Fajro interjected, "If I may, magistrate, Liffa is quite awake, and clearly fit for a trial. A delay will only make this more difficult for Liffa."

"I suppose," he said. The magistrate considered his words and looked toward me. I could see the confidence in his posture and facial expression that his lifetime of experience as a magistrate must have given him. "Does this suit you, Liffa?" he asked.

He cleared his throat, and began to speak in a pronounced and regal tone. "Liffa Um Heiko, you have been charged with corruption of consciousness and interruption of the senate during its deliberation. Do you understand?"

"I do."

"As a magistrate, it is my duty to uncover the facts surrounding a matter and deliver a just punishment under the law. Do you understand?"

"I do."

"Do you submit to questioning, that all truths and falsehoods may be uncovered for what they are."

"I do."

<!-- left off -->

He broke into a more casual tone, "So at this point, I'm just gonna ask you some questions about yesterday, and make sure they check out with what I heard from the other interviews."

I was a bit surprised, but stammered an "Okay" in my sleepy stupor. He hung the lantern up on a hook and produced a paper and charcoal.

"All right. Question one -"

"Wait.. Why are you being so nice to me? I'm a criminal."

"I find these things go smoother when I'm not judging you from my shining pedestal on high. We all do strange stuff. Whether we feel convinced it's the right thing, or a fit of passion compelled us. I'm not here to judge you personally. I'm just here to translate the law."

"Oh. That makes sense."

"So anyway, Question one. What did you barge into the senate for?"

"I had to announce some news."

"It couldn't wait until after deliberation?"

"It was highly urgent; I had to get it out before they locked themselves into a spending decision or adjourned and left for the day."

"Did the senate agree?"

"It's uncertain. I think you'll find many who did."

He finished jotting his notes and then turned the page for the next question.

"Question two. How did you come upon this news?"

"It was hand-delivered to me by the lead Ara observer of Heiko."

"Why wasn't the observer the one to deliver it?"

"He had to continue his observations."

"And your job?"

"I'm just a farmer. I can skip a day and make it up later."

"Well, not anymore," he said under his breath, and continued.

"So why was this message delivery delegated to you, Liffa?"

"It was intended for Melna, my jundwoman."

"Melna? As in žah-Melna, the Heiko fidelant?"

"Yes."

"Ah. I see."

He wrote some more notes and turned the page again.

"So that leads to question 3. How did you get into the deliberation hall in the first place?"

"I was helping a disabled ex-fidelant who was traveling to the senate."

"My, you certainly walk in high circles. You have a name?"

He stared at me, while I hesitated.

He said, "Come on, Liffa. I've got no intention of nabbing your friend. There's nothing illegal about an ex-fidelant walking the grounds."

I thought about what Melna said about him. To never trust Fajro. Perhaps the truth would help me more than protecting him would.

"Fajro. He was a fidelant for Holrag."

"Fajro, eh? That explains why he was so eager to ask about you."

"He asked about me?"

"You could say that. But we'll talk about that later. You were saying?"

"Oh. Yes, I was helping him walk on account of his injured leg, and he was helping me get to the deliberation hall. He believed in the importance of the news too."

"And how exactly did he help you?"

"He distracted the guards while I... snuck in."

"Ah, that makes sense."

He finished writing and folded the paper into an inner pocket of his robe.

"Ok, I have to get all formal again, now."

He took the lantern in his hand and assumed his regal pose. It made me nervous even though it seemed silly.

"Liffa Um Heiko, I have gathered as many facts as I could and have reached a conclusion. I find you innocent of corruption of consciousness under the codex of Palinan and absolve you of all accusations of such claim."

I felt a slight relief, but knew the other was inescapable.

"However, the codex of the senate makes clear that any interruption of any kind during deliberation is illegal. For this reason, I find you guilty of interruption of the senate during its deliberation."

The conviction was expected, but it still hurt.

"The sentence shall be a period of thirty days in Ulukoma. Do you understa-"

The door opened in a rush, and the magistrate paused to see who caused the disturbance. Two lanterns were in view.

"Fajro? What are you doing here?" the magistrate asked.

I was thinking the same thing, but I quickly changed my mind when I saw the other face.

"Kipnu! You came!" I shouted.

He rushed to me and reached for my face with his free hand. Fajro walked in his slower pace toward us and attempted to bow to the magistrate.

"Oh there isn't any need of that," the magistrate said.

"Pardon my old habits. They've taken a permanent residence with me." He responded.

He reached the other side of Kipnu and looked closely at me, trying to telegraph something but I did not know what.

"I hope we came in time to defend Liffa," he said.

The magistrate responded, "Well, it's a little bit late, but I'll permit it if you have something to say worth adding."

The magistrate turned to me and asked, "Liffa, do you approve of Fajro's testimony?"

"Only if Kipnu is allowed to speak as well."

"Yes, that would be fine."

The magistrate took his paper and charcoal out again and turned to Fajro, motioning for him to speak.

Fajro began, "Liffa was helping me walk. I intended to interrupt the senate myself, and unwittingly inspired hae to finish the job when I was stopped by guards."

I was aghast. He was taking the blame? For what?

The magistrate stopped writing and laid his forehead into his hand. "That's quite a thing to admit, Fajro, but Liffa was still the one who actually interrupted the deliberation."

He replied, "I understand. My only hope for my testimony is that you give a lighter sentence to a maman who was acting under my orders."

"Well, the codex of the senate has pretty clear guidelines on sentencing for interruption. I would be risking my post if I let hae free without punishment."

Kipnu turned to the magistrate and pleaded to him, "Please sir. Liffa had every positive intention. Thi doesn't deserve to be shipped off."

Fajro chimed in, "Perhaps an alternative arrangement can be made. One that is beneficial to both Liffa and all of Palinan."

The magistrate butted in, "Absolutely not. The law does not allow–"

"–I think you'll find that the law does allow alternative punishment if the senate itself should decide," said Fajro as he shoved a letter into the magistrate's chest. Fajro turned his head toward me now as if ensuring that I was paying attention.

"If Liffa is inclined, thi could work with me in Holrag on our observational study of the obscura."

I replied immediately, "I am not inclined."

"Hold on, Liffa, let me finish. You would be working with our scientists to send a spacecraft up and figure out what we're dealing with. It would take no more than a few days, then you can head back home to Heiko."

I retorted, "What use would a farmer be to scientists?"

"A farmer? Worthless. But you're more than that aren't you?"

I was aghast. How could he possibly know that?

"I've heard how you gave up your observer aspirations for the family trade. Honorable, but such a waste of talent."

He was looking straight at me now, with a sincerity that was unmistakable.

"I've seen your eyes. The blood of Holrag is within you. It's been calling since you were born. You studied with the observers to imagine your own _nul sa'am_ to the stars. This journey was meant for you."

I thought of Jathi, surmised they would need his help to get a vehicle up there and back down again, but I wondered what would convince him. Then I remembered what Melna said about Fajro: his words were a cover for his actions.

"I don't trust you. You could do anything with me," I said.

"You're right. You can't trust me. But you also can't trust any of the criminals in that detestable Ulukoma either."

He took a step closer and I stepped back.

"Think of it this way," he explained. "If something were to harm the you under my watch – the Heiko fidelant's maman, the selfless hero-messenger – it would be disastrous for our entire project. You will surely be in safe hands. A few days on the frontlines of our very species is surely much better than whatever you would get in Ulukoma."

The magistrate butted in, "I believe that Fajro's suggestion would be a fitting alternative and that the state would see more use in applying you to the problem than sending you someplace where you mindlessly twiddle your thumbs in the cold.."

I withdrew from the door and faced the wall. I had never felt so powerless before: my fate was being discussed by a room full of powerful men while I stood in a cell, listening, understanding, with only a choice between two terrible situations. The silence in this room surrounded me, stifled my mind, begged me for an answer. Only the pulse in my head and the gentle shifting of cloth were audible.

"Gentlemen, let's give hae a moment," said the magistrate in a humbled tone.

I rushed to turn around. "Wait, Kipnu," I said. "Stay with me. Just you."

The others gathered their lanterns and moved to the other room, the magistrate wrapping his arm around Fajro to help. I walked toward Kipnu but didn't reach for him this time.

"How many people know?" I asked him.

"Only the senate," he said. "Melna told me it's up to each province to decide that for itself. The governor of Heiko has decided to reveal by hierarchy."

"What's that?"

"In order to stave off panic, people are told one-by-one in private rooms and are given tasks to help so they don't just mentally shut down. My parents were part of the first test, back when we had to ration for the long nights of ash."

"I remember learning about that from a friend. I was too young to remember and my parents never wanted to talk about it."

"All the farmers were working their hardest for the few days we had until the ash swallowed the sky. Then they cursed the air and covered their houses like the rest of us. They got the same rations as the rest of us of course, but you could see that they were crushed."

"We are a proud bunch. When the steam lines and electric rails were coming up, we held on to tradition. There's a certain sense with crops that farmers have. No machine could ever copy it."

"I believe it. I've seen it myself."

I reached for his shoulders under a thin, tightly woven tunic that he usually wore under his medical aprons. It reached for comfort more than for attention.

"Kipnu... What do you know about Fajro?" I asked.

"That man who was just here?"

"Yes. I met him on the train today."

"I've never seen him before."

"What? But he's a patient of yours?"

"I've never met that man in my life."

The truth of his deception had finally come to me, but by now it was far too late. I had been a puppet all this time, a passing tool in some political game I didn't want to be a part of.

"Liffa. What's wrong?" he asked, seeing the blank look on my face.

"Fajro got me into the senate because he used to be a fidelant for Holrag. But earlier when I met him on the train, he told me that you were his doctor. "

"So he set all of this up? How did he know to find you?"

"I don't know... Maybe Jathi? No..."

"I'll talk to him. Get to the bottom of this."

"No... Don't bring Jathi into this. I don't think it was him."

"What's his angle?" he asked.

"Apparently he didn't get along with Melna. Maybe it's to get back at her. And his offer is suspiciously generous. I think he needs me but I don't know what for."

"If that guy lays a hand on you–"

"No. That's too simple, too risky. He could use me as a bargaining chip against her though. Get what he wants out of Heiko for a La'To."

"He would need you for longer than that to get anything out of it. And Melna could simply push the story to the news wire if she wanted to kill his leverage. What do you make of this observational study? I thought Heiko had the best observatory."

"Maybe it has something to do with their space rail. Maybe they can send telescopes after all. But..."

Kipnu's face froze and looked worried all of a sudden. "No... they wouldn't."

"Wouldn't? Wouldn't what?" I asked, but it was too late. Fajro and the magistrate had lost patience and re-entered the room.

The magistrate announced to us with his casual voice, "I'd love to stand and chat in the dark with all of you, but I've got 13 cases to cover today. Are you ready to continue?"

I glanced at Kipnu, who was trying his best not to let his rage show on his face.

I answered the magistrate, "I'd like to ask Fajro about the study he's conducting."

"Why sure," Fajro said with a smile.

"Make it quick," said the magistrate, audibly annoyed, and he stepped back to observe.

"What is the goal of this project?"

"Well, it's a continuation of the space rail project. I can't really talk about it without a guarantee of your cooperation. Provincial secrets."

"What do you need me for?"

"Like I said before, you would be a communications liaison between The Heikoi and Holragi scientists."

"I'm not much of a talker, and your Holragi accent isn't thick. What do you _really_ need me for?"

He sighed and looked at the lantern light against the dusty ground.

"Liffa, you don't miss a thing do you. That's one of the reasons I think you'd be a good candidate for the job. The candidates we're looking for have to be lightweight, agile, observant, quick-learning, brave, and in great physical shape. They also need to be willing to take the risk."

"Risk? What risk?"

Our eyes met and he looked at me intently. "We need you up there, Liffa."

In my flood of imagination, I finally saw the dream that he saw. The danger, the pride. The whole planet. _I could die. I could die!_ I shouted inside my head.

Meanwhile, Kipnu had grown impatient. He grabbed Fajro by his tunic and got in his face.

"That's a death sentence, you piece of shit."

"Kipnu. Stop this," the magistrate tried to push Kipnu away, but wasn't succeeding.

"Kipnu," I tried to calm him, but he didn't hear me.

He pushed Fajro and held him against the wall, with Fajro letting out a cry of pain as his head batted against the stone.

"You think you can prey on my family, punk?" He tightened his grip on Fajro's shirt. "Find someone else to murder. Liffa is staying here."

"Kipnu. This is absurd. Stop this immediately." The magistrate shouted, and Kipnu backed down. Fajro collapsed to the floor with a hand behind his head, and passed out. The magistrate rushed over to check on him.

"He's breathing, but unconscious. Kipnu, what were you thinking?"

Kipnu wasn't amused, "Oh come on. He's faking it," but was growing unsure. He walked slowly over to the magistrate, who was now anxious being around him, and checked Fajro's vitals. He was unconscious.

The magistrate turned to me and quickly said, "Liffa, let's return to this after we come back," while he grabbed Kipnu by the arm and took him to the outer room.

_Kip, what have you done?_

"Fajro?" I called. He didn't answer.

I stared at his sleeping face. It was wrinkled with the smiles of the past. _Were they genuine? Are you simply misunderstood?_.

The magistrate came back in with a strong-scented cloth and some water in a small bowl.

"He's still unconscious," I said.

"Yes, and he might be after that scene. What was Kipnu thinking?"

"He gets very protective sometimes."

The magistrate dipped the cloth into the bowl and placed it on his lips. Fajro's lips started to move and then purse, and then he woke in a daze.

"Wha. Wha," he panted through broken questions.

"You passed out, Fajro," said the magistrate in a calming voice.

"My head? Wha-"

"It's a bruise, Fajro. Nothing major."

"Kipnu. What happened?"

"Just rest. He's gone now."

I felt no pity for Fajro. My mind was focused on Kipnu.

He sipped some of the water and sat up, motioning to the magistrate for the cloth. The magistrate handed it over and he put it behind his head.

"How are you feeling, Fajro?" asked the magistrate.

"I'll be ok."

"I'm going to deal with Kipnu. I'll send for a doctor right away."

"No. No need. I'll be fine."

I asked the magistrate, "What's going to happen to Kipnu?"

He stood up and walked over to me.

"He assaulted Fajro and interrupted his consciousness. He'll receive justice for his crimes."

"Just tell me."

"He's going to Ulukoma."

My heart sank. _Dammit, you fool._

He turned to walk out the door and said to me, "I'm going to handle Kipnu's case and I'll be right back again. Don't go anywhere," he said while walking out the door.

Fajro and I sat in silence for a few moments, staring everywhere but at each other. A feeling of guilt and embarrassment pervaded me. I acknowledged the senselessness of feeling self-aware about something I hadn't done, but it sustained nonetheless. There were qualities about the gray stone walls that I hadn't noticed without the lanterns. Deep chisel markings and pits where the stone's roughness hadn't been softened yet. What an enormous endeavor it must have been to carve this city by hand. To know that you would never reap all of its benefits, but add your effort anyway. Our whole society was founded on the glorification of works for the greater good, but Kipnu had found something more important. Perhaps he is also doing the right thing.

"Your boy is strong," Fajro said to break the silence. I mended it.

"He takes care of his body, I can tell. Maybe he should take care of his mind too."

He took a swatch of fabric from a pocket in his trousers and blotted his head with it.

"I guess he's not a fan of the idea, then," he said.

"You lied to me, Fajro. And you planned the lie before we even met. I have no reason to trust you, and all the more reason to assume that nothing you say is trustworthy. All of your plans seem to weave together in your favor a little too well."

"I don't blame you. Us fidelants learn to think a certain way. We tend to treat words as incantations more than expressions. They do what we want them to."

"Why are you doing any of this? What paradise awaits you at the end of all this?"

"Oh don't mistake me. I might be a good liar, but I don't do it for the pleasure."

"Then why?"

"This project. It's the only way our species can survive."

"What do you mean?"

"This obstruction – the obscura. Whatever it is, it's hostile. Whoever is controlling it will not stop until Palinan goes permanently dark. You read it yourself. We need you to understand what this thing is so we can stop it from blotting us out completely."

"And what makes you think we can do that?"

"You think we built a space rail with dumb luck? It took negotiation and compromise to bring together the best minds in all the world. We learned everything we could from them and then we made breakthroughs with our knowledge of electricity and metals. We sent countless test ships into space. Many of them orbited and then softly landed on their own with timers. We had space travel down to a science by the sweat and the grit of tens of thousands people."

"-and the blood of hundreds," I showed him that I knew of his reputation.

"Great things take great sacrifice, it is true. But the Heikoi were too simple-minded to see this. By the time we'd made things better, they left the deal."

"And you're still bitter about it."

"There is so much we still don't know about space. Nobody knows what's up there, in the great beyond. I came to Heiko to work with your observers, to discover new things about the universe we live in, but they just wanted to track the same information they had been tracking forever. And now this... obscura, as your observers call it. We're huddling in the dark with no plan. We could have been so far ahead of these invaders by now, but politics got in the way."

"So you're just doing this to prove you were right all along. And I'm your Heikoi hero for all the PR."

"Liffa, none of our feelings or policies or quarrels matter if we're all dead. I know that our project is the only way to survive, and I'm using what skills I have to recruit the people we need."

The argumentation side of my brain went quiet. He was right. Even if we were enemies now, it wouldn't matter once we're all freezing and starving to death.

"Is it dangerous?" I asked.

"Of course it is"

"...Does it hurt?"

"What, space?" he laughed. "I suppose you haven't learned what it's like. Imagine a place with no ground; no trees no ocean; no up or down, no sound at all. Just you, Ara, and infinite darkness. That's space."

I struggled to comprehend what that was like, but I didn't have much time until the door opened again.

"Fajro, how are you holding up," the magistrate asked.

"Fine, sir, fine."

He went over to Fajro to check on his head.

"You still look a bit pale, but you're getting better. Let me finish with Liffa, and then we'll get you somewhere we can look closer at your injuries."

"Thank you, magistrate."

The magistrate stood up and moved closer to me.

"Liffa, I realized that I might have been a bit too hasty in my decision to switch the sentence. I've decided to let you choose where to go. Does that sound fair?"

I answered, "Yes, magistrate. It's a generous offer."

"In that case, I'll continue where I left off."

He re-assumed his regal pose with paper and charcoal in hand, and cleared his throat in preparation.

"Liffa Um Heiko. I find you guilty of interruption of the senate during its deliberation. The sentence shall be a period of thirty days on Ulukoma _or_ a period of five days under the command of Fajro Um Holrag. Do you understand?"

"I do."

"Then I await your decision within the next 500 ticks of Ara[^2]. I will be back to -"

[^2]: Clocks on Palinan track divisions of the day in 20,736 "ticks", divided into groups of 12, 144, and 1728. One tick is approximately fifteen Earth seconds.

"Magistrate, I've already made my decision."

"You have?"

_I'm sorry, Melna._

"I'm going to Holrag."

<!--
I kept looking until their faces came into view. It was Melna after all.

I held a hand through the only gap in the wall and I plead to her, "Melna... before you say anything I–"

"Shh...," She took my hands and calmed me with her gentle voice, "Liffa... you did the right thing today."

The watchman left us to return to his post. I stared at her, confused, but then I looked into her eyes. There was a sort of relief there: the kind you get when a great weight of anguish has been liberated from the spirit.

She said, "When I saw you here, I was furious. But when you mentioned the observatory, I realized that you must have been sent by Thimlu and that everything else the senate was deliberating was irrelevant. I read the message to the senate and I told them I had been talking with the observers. Some of them believed me, but others did not."

"Melna, you aren't..."

"Angry at you? No. I'm angry at the senate. The message has swayed its course and it's become difficult to negotiate for Heiko. A fidelant from Holrag accused me of keeping all of this a secret so we could stockpile and profit on the chaos. Now they want Heiko to distribute enough food for all of Palinan to subsist on for 20 days."

"But we only stockpile enough for ourselves for 60 days. And what about their own stockpiles?"

"I know. But we must do this if we are to maintain our position in the senate. We will focus on rebuilding our grain reserves in the steppe."

"The steppe?" I scoffed. "Melna, you can't grow anything out there it's too hot."

"Things will begin to cool quickly. We can no longer grow in the same places. We must keep up with the obscura and move to warmer places."

"And what if the obscura decides to disperse one day while we're stuck out there?"

"We will have starved to death long before that if we don't start growing there."

"No! You can't let them push us around like this!"

"It's not that easy."

"Just refuse their demand!"

"It would risk a war at a time when we can't afford that."

I pounded on the walls and I retreated back into my cell, my arms throbbing from the pain I'd just caused them. Through the ringing in my ears, I heard the heavy beating of my hearts counting each moment as it passed in the depths of this wretched city.

"This senate... These are the people who protect our civilization from destroying each other? A bunch of angry men and women making bets with their people?"

"Liffa... It's complicated."

I paced again. This cell seemed smaller than it was before. I didn't let her see that I was fighting countless compulsions to rattle the door and scream at the top of my lungs. But my mind gave up and pushed me deeper into a depressive mess.

"So... what happens to me now?" I asked in a cracked voice.

"Well, they are unlikely to forego sentencing. A magistrate will visit you tomorrow with whoever wants to plea your case. Then he'll sentence you and take you to wherever that sentence sends you."

"And you'll be there, right?"

"Liffa... if I could–"

"Don't you dare twist your words on me."

She sighed and glanced to the side. "The senate has a special session tomorrow about the obscura. I have to be there to negotiate for Heiko. Otherwise, we'll be hung out to dry."

I took a step back and sighed. "I understand," I said.

"I'll get Kipnu to come. And I'll send a letter to the magistrate in the morning arguing for a lighter sentence."

"Thank you."

"Liffa. If I don't see you before you leave. Remember that I love you. Wherever you go."

I hadn't considered that this might be the last time I see her for a while. "I know your love. I know."

"The three of us are responsible for each other," she said. "I'll be fighting for home to feel like home. So you'll have something to look forward to when you come back."

"And I promise to bring my whole self back as well."

"Promise me, Liffa–"

The door opened again and the sound of broken footsteps caught our ears. They were slow, and intimated a slight limp that made his presence obvious.

"Fajro, what are you doing here?" I called to him.

Melna looked at me with confused and disdainful eyes. "Fajro?! What is that lecherous milta doing here?" she asked in a hushed tone.

I was surprised at Melna's reaction. Before I could explain, he rounded the corner and their eyes met.

"Did you put Liffa up to this?" she asked.

"Absolutely not. This was Liffa's idea."

"My apologies if I seem doubtful, but this is not the sort of idea thi would think of."

"Melna, these are dark times. Thi knows it. Now we all know it. We need more selfless heroes like hae who transcend the law and the bureacracy to do the things that we cannot wait for."

"Surely the untouchable ex-fidelant would make for a better hero."

_Untouchable?_

He scoffed. "You don't become untouchable by bringing attention to yourself, Melna. You know that."

I butted in, "I'm guessing you two have met?"

Melna was quick to snatch the response, "Regrettably, yes."

"Surely you're joking, Melna. Let our squabbles stay in the past where they belong."

"I know your game, Fajro." She didn't hesitate. "We're not playing it."

Fajro leaned back with a serious face now, "We can agree to disagree, but we will get nowhere pointing fingers at each other. The fact of the matter is that we are now in a battle for our lives against an unknown enemy. We must do everything that we can to come together, understand this threat, and fight it back as quickly as we can."

Melna paused to let his words die in the corners of the room.

"You have no business being here," she said. "This decision is between me and Liffa, so I'll ask you once nicely to leave."

"You're being ridiculous Melna, I only–"

"Get out."

He stared at her for a moment, with the same unfazed and perceptive look he always had, and then slowly turned around, slinging a glance my way.

"We'll talk later," he said to me.

Melna turned back to me, and said, "Another lie."

When he had finally closed the door on his way out, Melna came in closer to me and asked me under her breath, "How did you meet Fajro?"

"I met him on the train here. I couldn't have done this without his help."

"Of course. Listen to me, Liffa, that man will do anything it takes to force his will and gain power. He tricked the entire senate into a bad trade deal back when I was a junior fidelant. Heiko and Shaki were stuck donating food and freshwater to some shady mining project in exchange for a rail network. Then when he retired, it was clear that his company used our resources as leverage against the tribes of Holrag just to make his stupid space rail."

"I didn't know..." I said.

"Fajro's words may be sweet, but he is a conniving, manipulative bastard. Do not listen to anything he says."

"But then why would he help me?"

"To embarrass me and lower my status in the senate. Or perhaps he's working some other angle with the senate. Whatever it is you stay away from whatever he's offering, no matter how good he makes it sound. Do you understand?"

"I understand."

Her free hand was holding hard on my shoulder now, and she saw that I was uncomfortable, so she slowly rose her head again and calmed down.

"Good," she said. "I'm sorry I can't be at your hearing tomorrow. I'll send a message to Kipnu to see if he can come instead. Meanwhile you should get some rest."

I felt scared and alone again. "Where are you going?"

"I'm sorry. I have to prepare for tomorrow's session."

"Stay with me. Just for one more minute."

She looked at me for a bit, then hung her lantern on a hook in the wall and held my hand through the hole. This place smelled like piss and rust, but I didn't mind. I chose this woman and she chose me.

"I love you, Liffa. Kipnu would say it too if he were here."

"I know. You're here."

I lifted my head and gazed at her through the hole in the wall.

"I love you too."
