## Chapter 7

"Do you hear it? The ziyu..."

I looked up and saw my mother. Hae clay-smudged skin was illuminated by the low Ara-light of morning, and the leaves on the ziyu above us.

"The wind. It speaks," thi said.

"And we listen through the silence," I said.

Hae skin felt cold and fragile, like parched clay. Thi smiled down at me, and her hands began to disintegrate into the breeze.

"Listen," thi whispered, hae voice now indistinguishable from the wind.

"Mama, Where are you going?!" I called for hae to stay but thi kept slipping through my fingers, hae body sublimating into a cloud as if it were never there. The dewy breeze picked up and the tree began to sing all around me and I listened – closer than I'd listened before.

"What am I listening for, mama?

"Listen," said the breeze.

The whole world began to fade to darkess as the dream melted away and I slowly came back to reality. The room was dark save for a small window that faced toward another wall with just a hint of Ara-light coming in from above. I touched the bruises from Tinpo's grip on my arm, still tender to the touch, and recalled his harsh voice as he locked me in this place. My cheek was caked with dust from the floor I'd been sleeping on, affixed there by the sweat and grief I'd spilled before sleep took me away from all this. I'd have bathed in a trickle of water if I'd been afforded such a luxury.

There were markings on the wall that I could feel in the darkness: deep cuts where a chisel had chipped the marble, a rough surface unlike the rest of the city. And between them all were shallow scrawlings of occupants past that I could read with my fingers. The smallest of sounds reverberated there: a short breeze through the window, a little milta scurrying about in search of food, and the buzz of thoughts running through my head. I had prepared myself for Ulukoma, but not for the gnawing anxiety of sitting in a room alone. The time was strewn together like a trance or a prayer. I wondered if all this silence was meant to break one's perception of reality, to make them easy to handle. I wondered if the senate would believe Melna; if they would ridicule her for what I'd done. And where was the man who helped me? My accomplice, Fajro? Would he come to vouch for me as he'd promised?

<!--
- Liffa, Fajro, and the Magistrate are meeting
- Melna is stuck late in deliberation and so she can't come
-->

A door opened in the next room, waking me from the droning fog of a daydream. Two men were continuing a conversation as they moved through the room and I listened intently to their muffled voices. Their tone and dialect were unfamiliar to me, but I'd already learned not to trust my own ears outside of Heiko. Their voices approached the door of my room and it opened it with a mechanical clink. Their footsteps began to ring off the gray stone walls and I stood up to see the first figure, a man who was somewhere between young and old, robed in gray, with a face cast orange by the lantern he held in his hand. The other stood at length in the dark, but I could tell by his silver cane that it was Fajro.

"Liffa, we've come to pay you a visit," said the robed man. He gifted me a genuine smile, the first I'd seen since leaving Heiko, and it set me at ease for the moment. "Hope we didn't wake you."

"N-No, not at all," I stammered. I instinctively put my hands on my belly.

"I'm Sunte, and I'll be the magistrate for your case." He put his hands behind his back to reveal the red sash of Shaki legalists at his waist. "You were told that I would be here, no?"

I hesitated, trying to remember. "The guard... Tinpo. He said you would be here in the morning."

"Ah. I see. I hope this doesn't come as a shock to you, but we are... in the mist of the morning."

I felt disoriented. How could it be morning already? The magistrate saw the bewildered expression on my face and said, "We can come back once you're ready."

"No, No, I'm fine," I said. "I just...I can't believe it."

"The stay in these cells can be rather disorienting," he said. "This tiny window doesn't let much light through. Hard to tell the color of Ara."

I could see the confidence in his posture and facial expression that his lifetime of experience in law must have given him. I grew curious. "You are... a magistrate?" I asked him. "Are all magistrates so nice?"

He laughed and said "I find these things go smoother when I'm not judging you from my shining pedestal on high. We all do strange things. Whether we feel convinced it's the right thing, or a fit of anger compelled us. I'm not here to judge you personally. I'm just here to translate the law as it pertains to you."

I would have liked to say something more eloquent than "Thank you", but that is unfortunately the chain of words that my tongue had decided to express. The extent of my exhaustion had become awkwardly clear, but thankfully he changed the subject.

"How are you feeling?" he asked. "Do you need anything before we begin?"

"I want to talk to Melna," I said.

Fajro interrupted, "The senate has been in deliberation all night about the message you delivered. They've had a few breaks for rest and administration, but they're still debating this very moment. Melna won't be able to come here for a while."

"They didn't sleep?" I asked.

The magistrate spoke again with his calming voice, "I would love to wait until Melna is ready, but we don't yet know when that will happen."

"Then I'll wait," I said, walking away. "I can wait here for her."

He wore a pitied look. "I'm sorry Liffa. The law permits me but a day for a case like yours. Perhaps there's someone else who you'd like as a advocate?"

I looked at Fajro, and he gave me a nod of trust. Perhaps he really was true to his word.

"No," I said. "Fajro will be sufficient."

"Very good," said the magistrate. "Now then, shall we?"

He cleared his throat, and began in a pronounced and regal tone. "Liffa Um Heiko, you have been charged with corruption of consciousness and interruption of the senate during its deliberation. Do you understand?"

I hesitated, wondering why he was asking a rhetorical question at such a time. But he was patient and waited for me to respond on my own. "Y-Yes," I said.

"As an instrument of the law, I am compelled to question every detail, that all the facts of a matter may see the light of Ara. Do you understand?"

"Yes."

"As an instrument of justice, it is my duty to decide a punishment that fits the facts. Do you understand?"

"I do."

He broke his regal posture into a more casual stance and said, "So, now I just need to ask you some questions about yesterday, and make sure they check out with what I've heard from others. Answer what you can, but if you don't remember or don't know something, simply say so and I won't push any further. If at any time you feel compelled or overwhelmed you can refuse to answer, but remember that this is your opportunity to plead your version of the story. I cannot change the law, nor can I change the past, but I can reduce the severity of your punishment."

I was a bit confused by the ceremony of it all, but I stammered an "Okay" anyway, hoping to be done with all this questioning. He hung his lantern up on a thick steel peg that was hiding in the shadows and produced a small slab of marble with a leaf of paper affixed to it, and a well-used charcoal-ink pen from a small case tied around his wrist.

"Let's begin with the main question at hand. Did you do it?"

I paused, wondering if his question was a joke. "There were hundreds of witnesses. I couldn't lie my way out of that if I wanted to."

He smiled and said, "I'm just ensuring common ground, that's all. Now, tell me what led you to the interruption. What was the initial spark for all this?"

"I had to announce some news," I said.

He started to write on his paper. "It couldn't wait until after deliberation?" he asked as he finished his writing.

"It was urgent," I explained. "I had to get it out before they adjourned and left for the day."

"Did you try asking anyone for help?"

"I did," I said. "I asked Melna's assistant Pomri from the conduit in Heiko."

"And what happened?"

"She declined to help. She didn't want to be sent to Ulukoma."

I looked toward him, saw the warmth in his eyes despite his calculated words. There was no judgment in them, just observation. I'd never spoken to someone who was so attentive, or so charmingly intimidating. An affable paradox.

He finished jotting his notes and then turned the page for the next question. "How did you come upon this news?" he asked.

"An observer in Heiko intended for a message to be delivered to Melna in the morning. But she was gone when he tried to deliver it."

"Melna? As in žah-Melna, the Heiko fidelant?"

"Yes."

"And you were there when they showed up?"

"Ah, yes. Melna is my jundwoman," I said.

"I see," he said, scribbling his notes quicker now. "And then?"

"The observer and I went to the conduit and we spoke to Pomri who refused us. We talked about what to do, and then... I volunteered to deliver it."

"Did you know what you were delivering at the time?" he asked.

"Well, no, but I trusted them," I said. I pondered showing my badge, to show him that my trust was not misplaced. But I wanted to keep the observatory out of it. "It was imperative that they continue their work and I was available."

"Were you being coerced or blackmailed?" he asked plainly.

"No!" I said, surprised. "Absolutely not! They're my friends. They would never do such a thing to me!"

He smiled as he wrote. "I just needed to check, that's all," he said. He turned the page again with a deep breath. "So that leads to my next question: how did you get into the deliberation hall?"

I thought of glancing at Fajro to ask for help or a sign, but the magistrate's all-seeing eyes were so apparent that I was afraid he would see even the faintest of movements. So I looked squarely at Sunte and told him the truth. "I was helping a disabled man who was traveling to the senate."

"Do you have a name?"

I was taken aback. "Don't you know already?" I asked.

The magistrate was amused. "I may, I may not," he said. "I have neither the inclination nor the liberty to say. My questions are simply a way for me to understand you."

"I see," I said. In a frantic hesitation, I tried to manufacture a name so as not to incriminate the one person who could bring an end to this mess, but my mind had frozen in time with the magistrate's eye upon me.

Fajro interrupted. "Your piety," he said. "It's quite stressful for the maman to be asked to reveal the name of a... close friend. Perhaps we should move to another question and revisit this later."

The magistrate turned to face the ex-fidelant and looked him in the eye. There was a moment of understanding, and perhaps hostility between the two of them as they stared at each other for a brief moment. "No need," he said quietly, almost submissively. "I think I have the facts I was looking for." He folded the paper into an inner pocket of his robe and glanced at me, unable to look me in the eye. "I'll be back shortly," he said as he hurried toward the door. I wondered what unspoken words had been exchanged between them.

Fajro hollered behind him, "Don't take too long, now. Our brave messenger from Heiko deserves better."

The magistrate held the door open for a moment, no longer observing but thinking deeply, as if his all-seeing eyes had turned inward. "Yes, of course," he said, and he passed through the door as it seemed to close gently under its own weight.

<!--  Fajro gives the offer -->

"Quite an agreeable man, Sunte," said Fajro. "With a keen eye and a sharp mind. He'd do well as an observer, wouldn't you say?"

"Maybe," I replied. "I-I'm not sure."

"But aren't you?" he said, in a puzzling way.

"Listen, I need your help," I said, focusing on the subject at hand. "I don't want to go to Ulukoma."

"My help?" he laughed. "As I recall, you said you could get along just fine without me getting in the way."

"I've changed my mind. After seeing Melna react the way she did... I need to be here, with my family."

He looked toward the small window facing the wall and looked slightly upward at nothing in particular. "The law is the law," he said. "I cannot stop the magistrate from handing down a punishment."

I pleaded to him, "There must be another way, I–"

"-But... perhaps an alternative punishment can be arranged."

I went quiet. "I'm listening," I said.

He broke from his trance at the window and walked toward me. "If you are inclined, you could come with me to Holrag for a few days, then you can head back home to Heiko."

"I am not inclined," I said.

"Perhaps I can change your inclination. You see, the world has changed overnight. Ever since you delivered that tiny slip of paper everyone's been scrambling for answers. But the one question they can't answer is what this obscura is. I want you to answer it for them."

"Me?" I exclaimed. "What use could a farmer be to a problem like that?"

"A farmer? Worthless. But you're more than that aren't you? You were once an observer, and a good one at that, but you gave up your dream to pick up the farm where you mother left it. Honorable, but such a waste of talent."

I was aghast. How could he possibly know so much about me? There was a sense of mistrust for Fajro that was brewing deep within me. Everything was too perfect, too convenient for coincidence. I needed assurance that I wasn't a tool for some other end.

"You could ask any observer in the world. Most of them have more experience than me. What do you _really_ need me for?"

He chuckled and looked at the lantern light against the dusty ground. "Liffa, you don't miss a thing do you? You're right, I need you for more than just your mind. You have a very unique set of traits. You're lightweight, agile, observant, quick-learning, and strong as a full-grown saffa, thanks to your time in the fields. But most importantly, you understand how important this is – more than just an academic triviality. This is proof that something else is out there; something ripe for discovery. The future of our people lies far beyond this planet and you belong there; leading us all into that great unknown."

He knealed to my height and spoke in hushed tones with a familiar vigor of a man eager to convince me. "I've seen the haw on your eyes, the tone of your skin. The blood of the Holragi is in your veins. It's been calling to you since you were born. You studied with the observers because you imagined your own _nul sa'am_[^2] to Ara." The light from the window glimmered against his face, showed the fire in his eyes as he looked into mine. "I want you to go on the journey that you've been waiting for your whole life: to travel beyond our planet into that great unknown, and return to tell everyone what you saw there."

[^2]: The tribes of Holragi constantly migrate across the vast lands of Holrag in a cycle, sharing permanent structures amongst them. Nul sa'am is a Holragi term for a lone journey outside of one's tribe.

A chill flowed through my veins as he told my dreams back to me as if he'd known me my whole life. I had wanted nothing more than to explore the sky since the day I was born. But this was not how I imagined it. My eyes narrowed in suspicion. "You're right that this is important, but I will not be reckless with my own life," I said. "What if the obscura is hostile or armed? It could be a thing we can't even fathom yet."

"As we speak, we are sending an empty capsule to see how the obscura reacts. We wouldn't dare send a living thing until we know for sure what would happen."

"And if it does get destroyed, you would have me sit around twiddling my thumbs for a few days?"

"Think of it this way," he explained. "If something were to harm you under my watch – the selfless hero-messenger, the Heiko fidelant's maman – it would be a disaster for our entire project, for all the tribes of Holrag. You will be in safe hands. A day to learn how to control the capsule and two more making first contact, giving the whole world valuable information. Surely that's better than spending our last days in Ulukoma."

I withdrew and faced the wall behind me. The room felt much smaller with an impatient question hanging in the air. It surrounded me, stifled my thoughts, demanded an answer. I imagined flying up there in that dark blue void, trying to observe and communicate with some machination that no one had encountered before. I saw the dream that Fajro saw: not just preventing our own extinction, but unlocking our understanding of what's really waiting for us out there. A dream so big that it could be the death of me, alone in a tiny metal capsule with nothing but the infinite empty sea and the never-ending light of Ara.

<!-- Kipnu barges in -->

A new voice entered the other room: a man, agitated and moving about. I heard some shuffling of feet, and some failed attempts by the magistrate to calm him down. The man to the door and identified himself by my name. "Liffa!" Kipnu yelled for me.

I ran to the door to feel his presence though I didn't say a word out of fear for his safety. I wanted him to leave before he made any rash decisions. The door rattled under his strength as he said my name again. He knew that I was here, and he wasn't going to leave until he saw me.

"Kipnu!" I yelled through the door. "What are you doing? Get out of here!"

Fajro stirred, uneasy at the sound of his name. "Your jundman?" he asked. "What's gotten into him?"

There were sounds of shuffling and shouting as the magistrate fled to call for help. I backed away from the door, anticipating some movement, and with a sudden clink the door flung wide and brought Kipnu into the holding cell. I ran into his arms, his warmth, and he held me in a way that I so desperately needed.

The magistrate barged in after him. "You're in corruption of a hearing," he said. "I urge you to leave, or you'll be put in a cell yourself."

But Kipnu wouldn't move an inch. "Liffa needs an advocate," said Kipnu. "You're not administering the law without an advocate for the accused."

"Liffa already has advocate," said the magistrate. "Now please remove yourself from this place."

Kipnu's hands dropped from my arms as he looked back at the magistrate with suspicious eyes. "Who?" he asked. The magistrate looked past him toward the window, and he turned around to look the same way. His eyes spotted Fajro's silhouette in a dark corner near the window, seeming to hide from view. "You claim to advocate for Liffa," Kipnu said. "Then show yourself."

The magistrate moved to stop Kipnu from advancing, but Fajro held his hands up calmly as he stepped into the light. "Kipnu," said Fajro. "Lovely to meet your acquaintence."

Kipnu turned to me in confusion. "Who is this?"

"You... you met him today," I said. "He told me that he came to–"

Fajro butted in, "–Alas, I didn't have time to meet the greatest physician in all of Heiko. There was a much more pressing matter to attend to at the senate."

"How do you know Liffa?" Kipnu asked him.

"I did not know hae before yesterday. But kismet has a tendency to bring strangers together in serendipitous ways."

"You had a hand in this, didn't you?" Kipnu surmised. "Did he put you up to this?" he asked me without turning his eyes.

Fajro paused with a deep breath and began to pace around the lamplight. "A hand? No. Liffa understood that hae message had to be delivered for the greater good of the world and thi took a sacrifice no one else around hae was willing to take. I did not coerce hae; thi had already done that for haeself. My role was to calm hae spirits and ease hae journey. And now I've come to lend my help again."

"Is that true?" he asked me, but my confidence in the truth had eroded. I stared at him, unable to prouce an answer. He turned back to Fajro. "What help you've already given has landed hae here. There is no more need for you."

"Oh I beg to differ," Fajro retorted. "Magistrate, I presume you've reached a sentencing decision."

Kipnu turned back to the magistrate who stood behind us with an uncomfortable look about him.

"I have," said the magistrate as he entered the room again. He looked at both Kipnu and Fajro as if to glean some prediction, his sharp eyes were now mired in worry.

He began, "Liffa Um Heiko, I have gathered as many facts as I could and have reached a conclusion. The codex of the senate makes clear that any interruption during deliberation is a corruption of all who are there. For this reason, I find you guilty of corruption of the deliberation of the senate."

"Guilty" carries a suffocating weight to it, as if the mere utterance of the word could fill a lake and drown you in it. But I'd been preparing for this moment since the first step of this journey: I took the pain but I knew that "guilty" did not define me.

The magistrate paused to scan the room again, searching for some interruption or tangent to delay what he had to say next, but all of us were waiting anxiously to hear the rest. "The senate has delivered a message regarding Liffa's sentence," he said. "It shall be hae choice between two paths. One: to send away to Ulukoma for a period of twenty days. Two: to send away to Holrag under the care of Fajro um Holrag for a period of three days as the first sky explorer on the Ara line."

_How did Fajro tell the magistrate his wishes?_

"Outrageous!" Kipnu interjected. He wasn't prone to rash decisions, but I could tell he was on edge. "This is corruption. An advocate with an interest in the punishment? Is this what you call justice in Shaki?"

The magistrate did not move his eyes from me. "I've told you to leave. I will not tell you again."

"Let's settle ourselves gentlemen," said Fajro. "Kipnu, you don't want Liffa to go to Ulukoma. Neither of us do. As an advocate, I'm giving hae a way out."

Kipnu wasn't convinced. "You think I'm not onto you? I don't know what you plan to do with hae, but thi doesn't belong in Holrag."

"You mistake my intentions. Liffa is a comrade, a hero of the people. Thi will be treated with utmost respect. Besides, the only arrangements I make are those that are mutually beneficial."

"And what benefit does thi get from this arrangement?"

"Thi and I have talked it over. Perhaps you can ask hae yourself."

They looked at me and I froze. Kip would never understand why I wanted to go. I used to tell him how my days as an observer were the best of my life, how I grew up reading books about the little glimmers of light hiding in Ulu and wanted nothing more but to see them for all their glory. But he never understood why I would want to leave a place so perfect as the home we grew up in. Melna knew how painful it was for me but I knew if she were here she would undoubtedly think up some crafty way to sway my opinion. I had grown more fond of the idea after Fajro planted it in my head. Despite his suspicious intentions, I believed there was sincerity at the core of Fajro's offer.

"Kip..." I said his name, and he turned away. But I'd seen this before. I knew he was still listening. "We're all looking death in the eye right now. We need to look for a way out or we're all done for. And if there really is nothing that can be done, I want to be there with you and Melna, at the end. Not on some strange prisoners' island."

"How can you be so sure that you'll be safe where up there? This is all just a big experiment. Let them send one of their own if they believe in it this much."

"I am not just Heikoi, Kip. I am Holragi, too. Have you forgotten? My father taught me that life is so rarely blessed with a journey of purpose; that regret follows those who do not heed its call."

"And our village taught us that all life is sacred. There is nothing in your journey that is more important than your life."

"If this is really the end for all of us, then it very well may be. What I find out there may save everyone, repaying the debt of my life millions of times over."

"No," he said. His voice was broken, filled with frustration. "You're throwing your life away on a hope." I looked at Kipnu's sullen face and for a moment I felt a sense of doubt come upon me. His eyes grew wide and wild with anger. "You did this," he raised his voice to Fajro. "You filled hae mind with these delusions."

"I did no such thing," Fajro responded. "Liffa understands the gravity of our current situation and the bravery it will take to overcome it."

<!-- Kipnu roughs him up -->

Kipnu rushed toward Fajro and held him against the wall with a terrifying look in his eyes. Fajro let out a cry of pain as his head hit the stone.

"This is absurd. Stop this immediately!" The magistrate shouted.

But Kipnu tightened his grip on Fajro's shirt. "You will regret this," he said.

"Kip, stop this!" I uttered in a flustered voice. He let go and Fajro collapsed to the floor while the magistrate rushed over to check on him.

"He's unconscious," said the magistrate. "What were you thinking?"

Kipnu looked back at Fajro, and showed no signs of remorse. He knew he'd damned himself, but he was too angry to care.

The magistrate turned to me. "I'll return with a doctor shortly," he said. "Take care of Fajro." He grabbed Kipnu by the arm and dragged him back through the doorway he'd barged through, leaving it ajar. I peeked my head out of the doorway and watched as they retreated down a long hallway and into another room.

_Kip, what have you done?_

<!-- Fajro uses the alone time to convince Liffa that he alone can save Kip from Ulukoma. Liffa considers going to Ulukoma to be with Kip, but wants both of them to avoid it. -->

A groan from behind startled me from my own trance at the door as Fajro roused himself awake. I took that quiet moment of despair to walk back into the room and check on him. He brought his left hand up and behind his head to feel for a wound and I followed it. There was a small welt but nothing seemed broken or bleeding.

"Your man's got quite the arm to hold me against a wall like that," said Fajro sluggishly.

"I do not pity you. And I do not pity him," I said as I slumped against the wall next to him. "You both think you know better than the other. But you don't. Not really."

"I don't need your pity," he said. "I knew how people would respond to my ideas. I've been fighting that headwind for all of my life."

"It's not your ideas that he's mad about." I shuffled in the silence, trying to muster some bravery to ask a pointed question. "Is it true, what he said? That you have some other reason for choosing me?"

"The only thing I want is for the world not to die off in the cold darkness. Right now, the world needs a hero. We needed you when you sacrificed your freedom to deliver the truth, and now we need you again. You can choose to stay with the ones you love until the very end when we're all freezing to death in the dark. But I don't have that choice: I cannot bring myself to give up when the hero we need is right in front of me."

I imagined the end: parents, children, the wicked and the righteous, every loved one that ever loved or died trying. All of us huddled together like statues in some forgotten corner of the universe. What good would love do when we're all gone? Maybe he was right.

"Do you love anyone, Fajro?" I asked him. "The way that man loves me?"

"In Holrag, we love all of our tribe," he said. "It is _k'aal_[^3] to have favor." He paused for a moment then asked me, "What are you on about anyway?"

[^3]: Aal is the shared spirit of all members of one's tribe, or more recently, the shared spirit of all the Holragi people. K'aal is a state of sin against Aal.

I thought for a moment about Mel and Kip, about the words I could use to explain what I felt. But all the little nuances of emotion were so complex in how they manifested that I couldn't begin to put them into words. "Love between three people is hard to describe to someone who has never experienced it. If you understood what I was leaving behind, you would know how difficult it is to say yes to what you're asking of me."

He balked. "My people understand love differently. Love is trust, sacrifice, pain. You endure your lot without complaint that everyone else may benefit."

"If all you know in love is suffering, then your love can never grow."

"And if all you know is comfort, then love will _stifle_ you."

<!--
- Doctor enters with the magistrate and checks on Fajro
-->

The magistrate barged back in, with an older woman carrying a wooden case in tow.

"How is he?" the magistrate addressed me.

"I'm fine," said Fajro before I could say anything. "Just a bump."

The magistrate pressed, "Sir, you were unconscious. Please allow the doctor to–"

"I'm fine," said Fajro. "Let's just get on with it."

The magistrate nodded to the woman who glanced again at Fajro, looking disappointed, and left quietly with a sigh of frustration.

<!--
- Liffa asks about Kipnu, but magistrate says nothing can be done.
-->

I asked the magistrate, "Sir, if I may ask, what will happen to Kipnu?"

"The law is the law," he replied sternly. "Nothing can be done."

"Does that mean–"

"–He's going to Ulukoma."

_Kipnu, you idiot._

I contemplated changing my mind, following Kipnu to Ulukoma to live out our last days together. Surely Fajro would find someone else just as capable, wouldn't he? I imagined someone else in that capsule, staying calm, trying to make sense of whatever was out there.

"I request a condition if I am to go to Holrag," I said to the magistrate.

The magistrate balked. "You're in no position to ask for–"

"-No, it's fine." Fajro interrupted. "Go on."

I straightened my posture and steadied my breathing, scrounging what confidence I could muster. "I request that Kipnu goes with me."

I had crossed a line with the magistrate and he vehemently denied my request. "Absolutely not," he said. "Beside the fact that he attacked Fajro and may do so again, the justice system of Shaki would be up in arms if I afforded a violent criminal the same respect as a trespasser in earnest.

"A traveler needs a companion that can be trusted," said Fajro. "I respect that. But perhaps someone else would make our magistrate friend happier."

I moved to the window to clear my mind, watching the wall stare back at me as I thought of who I could trust the most, who would be adventurous enough to say yes to something so dangerous. There was only ever one.

"Jathi," I said with hesitation. "I want him to review everything and approve it before I go up.

"Jathi..." said Fajro. "And who might that be?"

"An observer," I said. "He works with Thimlu at the observatory in Heiko."

"Ah. An old friend." He thought over my proposition for a moment. "Can he can keep up with us? He cannot interfere with the timeline."

"He's very quick when he needs to be," I reassured him. I saw the magistrate about to dissent, and pre-empted him, "You don't have to ask. He will come."

"How can you be so sure?"

"Him and I have a special... It's a long story. Just trust me. I know he'll be there."

The magistrate wore an expression of uncertainty on his face, as if they very law he had sworn to uphold was laughing in his face. He took the nearly-empty lantern from its perch at the center of the room and assumed his regal pose. "Liffa um Heiko, the law has granted you a choice between two punishments: a rare gift that only the senate itself may bestow. Have you taken the time to consider the choices before you?"

"I have," I said.

"Then, pray, tell us your decision."

"I choose to go to Holrag."
