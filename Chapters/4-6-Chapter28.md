# Chapter 28

A light shone through the entry of the cove and disturbed me from my sleep.

"Annu," I whispered to her, "Do you see that?"

But thi remained in a deep slumber that I thought it best not to disturb. I gently sat myself up and emerged from Laen's nestling space, and crept quietly along the pebbles toward the water. A faint pillar of orange and infrared shone upon the ocean's surface, glittering between the wave crests. I looked up and saw a faint flame emerging from the dust cloud of Heiko, painting an arc of fire across the sky.

"Liffa..." I whispered to the air with parched lips. "What an awful thing to be greeted with."

I held closely to the listener on my ear, trying to find a pattern in the noise. But there was nothing but static and the howl of wind upon my skin. The bright arc grew steadily fainter and fainter, then faded again into the night.

"8 Tova'la left," I said to myself, recalling the times Jesse had confirmed.

"You are not forgotten."

I looked back at Laen sleeping face-to-face with Boon, wondered what they felt when they thought about Liffa or Pomri, if explaining it to them would be possible, or if it would even help. Maybe they simply trusted us to make things good in the end. I couldn't bear to tell them the truth.

With quiet steps I walked outside, being careful not to wander too far from cove. There was nary a sign of the scuffle that Annu had saved me from. The pebbles had been shuffled and the bodies reclaimed by the many fingers of the ocean. I searched the shoreline for the place where Pomri had been taken, but couldn't find it. The water had erased any evidence of its happening, without which virtue could hold no contempt.

"Good Morning, Linyu," called Annu from afar.

"You're walking now," I said in amazement, and noticed that thi had a caution with which thi took hae steps.

"Only just," thi said nonchalantly, "My eyes are taking on the blue again, and I can't sleep."

"The visions?"

Thi nodded. As thi walked closer, I could see the faint speckles growing in magnitude and number. I understood then how thi came to never die. That kanosin seemed to be growing inside of hae somehow. I came to hae and gestured on hae skin toward the kelp bandage on hae wound.

"...May I?" I asked.

Thi nodded, understanding my curiosity was for hae health. The bandage stuck well to hae skin, but I managed to peel a bit of it and saw only a mild scar. A swell of coruscating blue dots lie directly underneath.

"Well, go on," thi said, gesturing to the bandage. Slowly, I peeled it away to reveal the entire scar. Somehow, one could tell that it had healed quickly; the skin seemed to grow at different rates, leaving a misshapen, jagged crevasse of young hydroderm. Around the old scar were older ones, some small, some large. There were far more than I could count in the moment before thi closed hae robes.

"Come now. Let's get you back to Ulukoma," thi said.

"We need a ship," I noted. "For the saffas."

"A ship would be difficult to find and even harder to steal. Two canoes should suffice."

I thought thi was joking at first, but a glance showed thi was serious.

"A saffa in a canoe?"

"I've seen them in the water. They could swim the whole way to Ulukoma if the water wasn't so cold."

I imagined Boon and Laen swimming, their fuzzy heads jutting above the waves and wide paws pushing against the current. It looked so strange in my head, but I conceded that two canoes might be our only option.

"Rudjan," thi said, "That's the only place we'll be able to find them."

I imagined the impenetrable walls of Rudjan. How they filled out into the ocean to divide the throngia from the saffas and tilmarims; at least that's what Pomri had told me.

I looked over to Annu and asked, "You've been to Rudjan, right?"

"Yea..." thi said, thinking the same thing. "Well what ifâ€“ ... no... but..."

I interrupted hae, "Even if we could pass the wall, we'll face many more obstacles. If we fail any of them, it means death or enslavement. There has to be another way."

"Shh- do you hear that?" thi said. For once I wasn't the first to hear a thing.

I removed the listener and put my ear to the air. In the dead air, I could hear the sound of lazy oars splashing through the slush out of time.

"Looters?" I asked Annu.

"No. They couldn't carry anything in a row boat. Must be stragglers from the blockade."

In the darkness of the ocean, six lanterns suspended on the crooks of Rudjanese boats appeared, and a maman's voice was barely audible, "-n lao'a ... stea 'ose 'addles."

Annu's face widened immediately, as if a flurry of disparate thoughts were connecting themselves all at once. Thi loudly yelled, "Shinna!" as if hae belly no longer hurt.

The oars cut back to a silence, but no response came.

"You know them?" I asked.

"I know that voice, I heard it often when I was stowed away on Ramne's ship."

"How do you know we can trust them?"

"There's a reason Ramne had to steal a boat."

I smiled and couldn't wait to meet our new friends.

"Shinna! It's Ginnu!" thi yelled again.

The water remained silent for a moment more, then began with quiet disquiet, rummaging through the water. The sound followed a path toward the shore some fifty paces toward Rudjan. I looked to Annu who looked back at me with hae hand extended in a gesture of fellowship. I took it in mine, and together we walked along the shoreline toward the place where they were about to land.

Three boats slid to a stop upon the sandy sea floor, their crew sitting forward on the benches, sprawled out upon their oarshafts to relieve their muscles. A maman hopped down from the back of the middle boat with a rope and lantern, and waded toward the land trying to make out anything identifiable.

"Is anyone there?" thi called to the darkness, "Ginnu?"

Annu waited for a moment, observing hae with caution. Thi opened up once thi felt ready, "Shinna, over here!"

The maman paused and looked our way, hae eye catching the both of us.

"Ginnu! is that really you?" thi exclaimed. Annu and I waded out to meet hae voice, while Shinna waded as far as hae rope would allow.

"Melna told me what happened," said Shinna. There was a guilt about hae voice. "I didn't believe what she said until I saw the evidence."

"I owe her everything."

Shinna turned hae sight toward me, and then toward something behind me. I turned to see Laen and Boon walking toward us.

"Looks like you've met some friends."

"Linyu and these saffas have been throught a lot," thi said with an air of endearment. "But I'm glad they found me."

"Let me find a rock 'n we can talk more on land."

Thi found a sturdy rock to bind the rope to and with a few flicks of the wrist thi commuted a series of loops along the length of the rope, pulling it to and fro. As if from nowhere, a wide knot encircled the rock and held fast. I gasped in awe while Annu pulled me from my trance out of the cold water.

"Ginnu," Shinna began, "I... I'm sorry I never checked on you."

"Don't," thi swallowed hae emotions. "It exists only in the past. Leave it there."

"I just... he promised us that you were a friend. That you wanted to remain discreet."

"I can't fault you for things you didn't know."

"It is my duty to know what happens on my ship."

"Shinna, you can sulk about it all you want, but the past is the past. I'm done with that man. and I'd like it to stay that way."

Thi bowed hae head, hae guilt defeated.

Annu continued, "That name: Ginnu. It's what Ramne called me, but it's not who I am. My name is Annu."

"Annu... I won't forget it," thi said solemnly. "Annu and Linyu. Mamen of the dark."

I blushed, feeling vindicated at being called a maman again. I hadn't felt like a kaln since my mother-

Annu changed the subject, "About your boat. We need a way to Ulukoma."

"Why in Ara would you want to go there at a time like this?"

"It's... complicated. And I don't completely understand it either. But I can assure you that it's the only place left in the world for us."

"Bit dramatic, eh?" thi said. "My crew is already pretty demoralized. We just lost our ship and half our people to the blast. We've been rowing back home ever since. I couldn't very well convince them to row two strangers and their saffas out into colder waters on just a promise. Why don't you join us to Rudjan and then we'll get you sorted."

"The saffas can paddle," said Annu, pleading to Shinna with the last of hae bargaining chips.

I let go of Annu's hand and stepped forward, channeling my mother's bravery, trying on my gravest voice. "You saw that arc in the sky, cutting just above Heiko City?"

"We did. It struck the fear in our bones, that another blast might be coming." Thi knealt to my level. "You know what it was?"

"Liffa," I said with my best deadpan voice, "The great space pioneer. And Melna's bundmaman. Thi is still up there, orbiting around the planet, but not forever. I know exactly when and where thi will land, but Liffa will drown unless we are there to pull hae out of the water."

Thi began to consider the offer.

"And what about our next meal? We'd love to be heroes, but even a hero needs to eat."

"Did you never eat with us in Ulukoma?"

"We never saw anyone. The crates were always waiting for us on the shore and Ramne would handle payment."

"The Great Pavilion was a sight to behold. We had stockpiles of bread, kelp, and smoke-dried fish for our feasts. Much of the structure was reduced to ash in the fire but the stockpiles remain, buried underground."

"Made by slave labor, no doubt."

"That's the old Ulukoma. We don't do that anymore."

"Yet still you benefit from their labor."

"It would be wasteful not to."

"Perhaps. But wondering what will happen when those coffers are empty."

"We will all be sleeping soundly in the Palace of Ghosts by then."

"A palace, eh? And I presume that's the place Annu was talking about?"

Annu and I both nodded, our minds synchronized to the mission. Thi thought some more, looking into hae mind with closed eyes and long definite breaths, much the same way my mother taught me to look into the future. Thi opened hae eyes after a tedious pause, bowed to us, and turned toward hae boat.

I pleaded to hae, "Let me speak to them if-"

"No need," thi spoke with confidence, hae hand outstretched to quiet me. "We will take you and your saffas."

Thi took a step but then thought of something else.

"But if that kelp is shit-tier, you're dead."

Shinna yelled out to hae crew, "Change of plans crew. We're headed toward Ulukoma for a feast! And now we have some saffas to help us paddle."

A random voice badgered hae from the shadow, "Can we eat the saffas?" followed by muted laughter from the rest.

Thi replied, "I've been told that one of them has a palate for thick-headed men like you. Perhaps you'd like to test the rumor?"

Silence.

"Palace of Ghosts," said Annu chuckling under hae breath. Thi nudged me in the shoulder with a giant grin on hae face.

"What?" I asked coyly, but thi just held the grin and called the saffas.

Shinna led Laen and Boon onto the outer boats followed by Annu and me who laid on their backs to keep them warm and guide them. Surely as Annu had said, Laen and Boon immediately took to paddling in the water as if they had always known. Shinna's crew filled into the center boat and tethered their boat to both of ours â€“ a sort of precaution against theft.

I leaned forward into Laen's back and nuzzled my face his through his fur.

"Time to save Liffa," I whispered.

"Woooop!"

<!-- "Annu. What did you use to get here?"

"Ramne brought me here. I think I was asleep at that time."

"But if Ramne had to steal a boat, then he must have lost his last one. I wonder where  -->
