# Chapter 28

A light shone through the entry of the cove and disturbed me from my sleep.

"Annu," I whispered to her, "Do you see that?"

But thi remained in a deep slumber that I thought it best not to disturb. I gently sat myself up and emerged from Laen's nestling space, and crept quietly along the pebbles toward the water. A faint pillar of orange and infrared shone upon the ocean's surface, glittering between the wave crests. I looked up and saw a faint flame emerging from the dust cloud of Heiko, painting an arc of fire across the sky.

"Liffa..." I whispered to the air with parched lips. "What an awful thing to be greeted with."

I held closely to the listener on my ear, trying to find a pattern in the noise. But there was nothing but static and the howl of wind upon my skin. The bright arc grew steadily fainter and fainter, then faded again into the night.

"8 Tova'la left," I said to myself, recalling the times Jesse had confirmed.

"You are not forgotten."

I looked back at Laen sleeping face-to-face with Boon, wondered what they felt when they thought about Liffa or Pomri, if explaining it to them would be possible, or if it would even help. Maybe they simply trusted us to make things good in the end. I couldn't bear to tell them the truth.

With quiet steps I walked outside, being careful not to wander too far from cove. There was nary a sign of the scuffle that Annu had saved me from. The pebbles had been shuffled and the bodies reclaimed by the many fingers of the ocean. I searched the shoreline for the place where Pomri had been taken, but couldn't find it. The water had erased any evidence of its happening, without which virtue could hold no contempt.

"Good Morning, Linyu," called Annu from afar.

"You're walking now," I said in amazement, and noticed that thi had a caution with which thi took hae steps.

"Only just," thi said nonchalantly, "My eyes are taking on the blue again, and I can't sleep."

"The visions?"

Thi nodded. As thi walked closer, I could see the faint speckles growing in magnitude and number. I understood then how thi came to never die. That kanosin seemed to be growing inside of hae somehow. I came to hae and gestured on hae skin toward the kelp bandage on hae wound.

"...May I?" I asked.

Thi nodded, understanding my curiosity was for hae health. The bandage stuck well to hae skin, but I managed to peel a bit of it and saw only a mild scar. A swell of coruscating blue dots lie directly underneath.

"Well, go on," thi said, gesturing to the bandage. Slowly, I peeled it away to reveal the entire scar. Somehow, one could tell that it had healed quickly; the skin seemed to grow at different rates, leaving a misshapen, jagged crevasse of young hydroderm. Around the old scar were older ones, some small, some large. There were far more than I could count in the moment before thi closed hae robes.

"Come now. Let's get you back to Ulukoma," thi said.

"We need a ship," I noted. "For the saffas."

"A ship would be difficult to find and even harder to steal. Two canoes should suffice."

I thought thi was joking at first, but a glance showed thi was serious.

"A saffa in a canoe?"

"I've seen them in the water. They could swim the whole way to Ulukoma if the water wasn't so cold."

I imagined Boon and Laen swimming, their fuzzy heads jutting above the waves and wide paws pushing against the current. It looked so strange in my head, but I conceded that two canoes might be our only option.

"Rudjan," thi said, "That's the only place we'll be able to find them."

I imagined the impenetrable walls of Rudjan. How they filled out into the ocean to divide the throngia from the saffas and tilmarims; at least that's what Pomri had told me.

I looked over to Annu and asked, "You've been to Rudjan, right?"

"Yea..." thi said, thinking the same thing. "Well what ifâ€“ ... no... but..."

I interrupted hae, "Even if we could pass the wall, we'll face many more obstacles. If we fail any of them, it means death or enslavement. There has to be another way."

"Shh- do you hear that?" thi said. For once I wasn't the first to hear a thing.

I removed the listener and put my ear to the air. In the dead air, I could hear the sound of lazy oars splashing through the slush out of time.

"Looters?" I asked Annu.

"No. They couldn't carry anything in a row boat. Must be stragglers from the blockade."

In the darkness of the ocean, a maman's voice was barely audible, "-n lao'a ... stea 'ose 'addles."

Annu's face widened immediately, as if a flurry of disparate thoughts were connecting themselves all at once. Thi loudly yelled, "Shinna!" as if hae belly no longer hurt.

The oars cut back to a silence, but no response came.

"You know them?" I asked.

"I know that voice, I heard it often when I was stowed away on Ramne's ship."

"How do you know we can trust them?"

"There's a reason Ramne had to steal a boat."

I smiled and couldn't wait to meet our new friends.

"Shinna! It's Ginnu!" thi yelled again.

The water remained silent for a moment more, then began with quiet disquiet, rummaging through the water. The sound followed a path toward the shore some fifty paces toward Rudjan. I looked to Annu who looked back at me with hae hand extended in a gesture of fellowship. I took it in mine, and together we walked along the shoreline toward the place where they were about to land.

"Let's take a break all," Shinna said as their boat slid itself to a stop upon the sandy sea floor. A woman left the boat with a rope in hand and came ashore looking for a place to tie the other end. The rest sat forward on their benches, sprawled out upon their oarshafts to relieve their muscles.

<!-- "Annu. What did you use to get here?"

"Ramne brought me here. I think I was asleep at that time."

"But if Ramne had to steal a boat, then he must have lost his last one. I wonder where  -->
