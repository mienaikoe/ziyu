# Chapter 28

A light shone through the entry of the cove and disturbed me from my sleep.

"Annu," I whispered to her, "Do you see that?"

But thi remained in a deep slumber that I thought it best not to disturb. I gently sat myself up and emerged from Laen's nestling space, and crept quietly along the pebbles toward the water. A faint pillar of orange and infrared shone upon the ocean's surface, glittering between the wave crests. I looked up and saw a faint flame emerging from the dust cloud of Heiko, painting an arc of fire across the sky.

"Liffa..." I whispered to the air with parched lips. "What an awful thing to be greeted with."

I held closely to the listener on my ear, trying to find a pattern in the noise. But there was nothing but static and the howl of wind upon my skin. The bright arc grew steadily fainter and fainter, then faded again into the night, returning me back to cove near Heiko.

"You are not forgotten."

I looked back at Laen sleeping face-to-face with Boon, wondered if the thought of Liffa came to his mind from time-to-time, if anyone had explained to him what had happened or if he simply trusted that things would be good in the end.
