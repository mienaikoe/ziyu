# Chapter 28

A light shone through the entry of the cove and disturbed me from my sleep.

"Annu," I whispered to her, "Do you see that?"

But thi remained in a deep slumber that I thought it best not to disturb. I gently sat myself up and emerged from Laen's nestling space, and crept quietly along the pebbles toward the water. A faint pillar of orange and infrared shone upon the ocean's surface, glittering between the wave crests. I looked up and saw a faint flame emerging from the dust cloud of Heiko, painting an arc of fire across the sky.

"Liffa..." I whispered to the air with parched lips. "What an awful thing to be greeted with."

I held closely to the listener on my ear, trying to find a pattern in the noise. But there was nothing but static and the howl of wind upon my skin. The bright arc grew steadily fainter and fainter, then faded again into the night, returning me back to cove near Heiko.

"You are not forgotten."

I looked back at Laen sleeping face-to-face with Boon, wondered what they felt when they thought about Liffa or Pomri, if explaining it to them would be possible, or if it would even help. Maybe they simply trusted us to make things good in the end. How could I tell them that their companions were never coming back?

I walked outside shortly, being careful not to wander too far from cove. There was nary a sign of the scuffle that Annu had saved me from. The pebbles had been shuffled and the bodies reclaimed by the many fingers of the ocean. I searched the shoreline but could not find the place where Pomri had been taken. Time had erased any evidence of its happening, without which virtue could hold no contempt. Perhaps that's why they hunted the shoreline.
