# Part III: Melna

<!-- _It's a curious occupation. You swear loyalty once to your family, and again to your state. So which comes first? Meanwhile, the whole universe conspires to tear it all apart. I don't know why anyone would want to be a fidelant._

- Recorded conversation, Fidelant Jorra um Heiko to Fidelant-Elect Melna um Heiko, Day 31,528 after the Fifth Cold -->

_The foundation of society is Truth._

&nbsp;

_No other law comes before this._

&nbsp;

_In the absence of truth, everything is consumed._
_Every chain in the armor of knowledge falls away_
_until nothing is left but ruin and doubt._

&nbsp;

â€” Philosopher Lanre um Shaki, Day 15,403 after the Fifth Cold
