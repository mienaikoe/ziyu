## Chapter 20


<!--
- Holragi wants to use Melna and Liffa as bargaining chips against each other when negotiating with Liffa about communicating with the obscura.
  - If Heiko is blockaded, there needs to be some external force to help them
    - Ulukoma?
      - Setre knows about Holragi's plan to destroy Heiko
      - They would have to plan to help Heiko already.
        - That's what planting Linyu was about
        - Why would they help Heiko?
          - Gain legitimacy in the senate
          - Avenge Kipnu's death
      - Melna and a small army would have to play decoy to try to buy time for Heiko.
        - Gets captured by Holragi's blockade. They kill her army.
      - A blockade by both Holragi and Rudjan would be massive.
        - Part 4:
        - They would have to sneak out secretly. How?
          - Kanosin+Antikan = no breathing for a long time. Swim out in the darkness to a ship only visible underwater (kanosin blue)
            - How does Heiko acquire Kanosin+Antikan?
              - Casra's stash in Shaki Harbor. Linyu+Setre fetch it
                - then arrive in Heiko (during a blockade?!)
                - then smuggle it into Heiko, taking on a disguise.
      - They don't have a navy. But they do have a fearless fighting force.
      - Setre could steal a boat from Rudjan with Linyu's help (going back to what she does best for the greater good)


- infighting as Linyu despises Setre for using Melna as a diversion to save Heiko

- Melna hides
  - Overhears talk about capturing Pomri
    - They didn't find Linyu, but Linyu can't see without antikan

- Pomri has been tricked into taking a train to Shaki
  - This sets up a sacrifice story where Melna has to trade her own life

- Linyu (and Pomri as an alternative) hid from Shaki soldiers and magistrates that had arrived at the train station looking for them. Thi hid for a long time and was guided by Setre+transmitter to a ship.
  - This brings Linyu closer to Antikan, which lets hae see.
  - Linyu can transmit information to Melna now.
    - Linyu can use numbers on their pendants to encrypt messages.
    - Linyu can route Heikoans to Ulukoma
      - If Linyu uncovers that they're now immortal

- Linyu/Pomri encounter Setre who fills them in about Ulukoma
  - and the invulnerability of Kanosin
    - They would still want to go to Shaki to tell the world about Holragi's betrayal.
