## Chapter 20

<!--
Well uhh.. Melna has a higher price being sold to Fajro so she gets to live for now.
Rape scene? idk that's a lot.

 -->

  *Thump.*

  She repeated the same word. *"Out." "Out."*

  *Thump*

  *"Out"*

  A warm breeze brushed her shoulder and exhaled a sigh across her skin. She was

  *Thump*

  somewhere she shouldn't be.

  *"Get out of there! Out!"*

  *Thump*

  *"Melna, you can't hide. I know you're in there."*

  *Where is here?*

  *"Out"*

  *"OUT"*

  Her consciousness frothed back into the back of her mind, and opened her eyes narrowly with nothing to see but darkness. A cold tingling sensation filled her body like billions of tiny electric currents running through her muscles as she slowly regained her sense of touch. She searched for her bearings and discovered that downward must be behind her, keeping her back planted against the damp floor. *I have that at least.* 
  
  She perused the senses that she did still have. Her arms didn't move, but she could feel her fingers, promising that her condition might be temporary, and her ears could pick up a consistent low thuds through the floor, though a neverending bell of injury served as a reminder that something terrible had happened to her. *Where is here again? It's dark. And. The floor is moving. Laen and then. Shinna. A ship. I'm on a ship.*

  Faintly, she could hear some rustling of another in the room and then she remembered Ramne, the rage on his face so brightly lit by that woman's eyes, and a wave of nauseous fear shook the rest of her body awake. She sprang her head up, and at once she found that she was naked and her arms and legs were loosely tied with a strong kelp to two wooden pillars on either side of her. Her eyes were open wide but still nothing could be seen in that darkness. She looked behind her and saw the faint glimmer of a porthole through which only a sliver of Ara's sky could be seen.

  "You're finally awake," Ramne's unmistakeable voice broke the darkness, and she turned around to face its direction.

  He continued, "Had me worried there. I need you alive, you know."

  "Choke on your own dick."

  He chuckled, "Still alive, and just as profitable. Nobody told me you were the fabled senator from Heiko. Would have been more gentle when I caught your leg."

  "Maybe your consideration can think to leave me the fuck alone next time."

  "Come now. Traveling alone, stuck in a musty old stow with a dead woman. Girl like you could use some company."

  "Not yours."

  "Oh I know I can be a little rude for people, but where you're going, you'll wish you were back here with me."

  She stayed quiet as he made a rustling noise and then his footsteps traveled toward her in slow knocks of his boots against the creaky floor and came to rest to her left side. She glanced around for a pair of blue eyes, but didn't see any sign of the woman. A faint whirring sound of a hot tip being warmed startled her and an oil lamp lit up, showing Ramne's smug face staring at hers. 

  He said, "Holragi is looking for you, you know. And they're promising a hefty reward."

  "What makes you think they'll actually pay it?"

  "They need me. I keep their masses... fed. That launch rail didn't build itself."

  "They keep slaves and you are responsible."

  "Hey, if kanosin is so bad they should stop begging me for more."

  "You know you would be the first to die if they would ever stop."

  "But they won't," he laughed, "They won't, and that's the beauty of it."

  He tilted the lamp over the ground between them and watched the flames crawl down the stream of oil and onto a growing pool on the floor. The flames licked her side with twinges of pain as they inched ever closer, but she tried her best to stay quiet and focus on escaping.

  "The senate. It doesn't have any real power, does it?" he spoke softly. "The people give you the power to choose and you use it to enact the will of whichever merchant has the most power over you."

  He poured out a little more and the flames began to singe her skin a little. She began to let out a whimper but caught herself to avoid giving him the satisfaction.

  "But you don't have merchants in Heiko. No promise of riches can buy your conscious thoughts, only the people of Heiko have that privilege."

  He leaned in closer and pulled Melna's face to look at him in the eye.

  "You don't know my power yet. It goes beyond money, beyond politics. Beyond even the obscura. But as your people become desparate and hungry and lifeless, you will turn to me. As will everyone else on this planet."

  He moved the lamp over her chest.

  "You will bow to me."

  He poured the hot oil onto her chest and it began to boil the water in her hydroderm and singe the flesh as it slid down her abdomen. The pain was unberable and she let out shrieks of pain that turned to agony as the flames consumed the oil. Her skin hissed as the pressure inside burst and bled water but the water couldn't penetrate the oil and stop the fire. Instead it continued boiling and hissing through the oil while Ramne held a sadistic smile on his face.

  Through her gesticulations trying get the oil off of her body, she saw a flash of firelight and then a shuffling of feet. The lantern moved away from her and seemed to cast confusing shadows across the room. Melna was so focused on her burns that she barely noticed when the lantern fell and a fire engulfed a crate on the other side of the room.

  A blanket fell on her suddenly and a pair of hands smothered the fire on her body. She cried out again from the sting of the pressure, but the blanket came off quickly after and the fire had been put out. She looked up, relieved from not feeling the fire anymore, and saw the massive fire roaring behind two familiar eyes, not blue and reflecting her bare body.

  "We don't have much time," she said as she was untying the binds around Melna's arms. "We need to get out of here."

  Melna's hands were free and she immediately lifted herself up and screamed in pain at the movement of her skin. Smoke from the wooden crate was beginning to fill the air and warn them that they had little time. The woman untied Melna's ankles from the post and helped her to stand up. She glanced back at the fire and didn't see Ramne anywhere, but had no time to ask qustions. Hastily, they climbed the stairs as quickly as they could and opened the door to clear chilly air and the dimmest light of Ara to guide them. Glass lanterns were hung where the crew had staked their claims on the deck, showing them the places they should stay away. Melna looked further toward Ara and saw the shape of the land at a distance she deemed swimmable but only just.

  "We could swim but we might freeze to death," said Melna.

  "There's no other way," she said.

  They snuck quietly to the side of the boat and looked down into the dark water below.

  "Do you have the strength?" Melna asked her.

  "I am not afraid to die," she said with conviction as she lifted herself onto the railing, "But I am afraid to live here any longer."

  Melna nodded again and lifted herself onto the railing as well, imagining for a second the pain she would feel with salt on her wounds. A shout came from behind them saying "Stop!" It was Shinna but thi was too far from them to do anything. Melna at once said "GO!" and the woman jumped into the ocean while Melna faced Shinna.
  
  "There's no escape. We'll only go after you again," Shinna yelled. Thi was standing a step away from her. Melna looked back to the woman who was yelling at Melna to jump in, but Melna knew that would only be more troublesome for her. Melna called out to her "GO! Find Laen," and she did not waste her time. Melna got off of the railing and turned to face Shinna, who was visibly horrified to see her scars.

  "I thought I could trust you Shinna," Melna said. "Then you left me with a monster like Ramne."

  Thi hesitated with a half a tear stuck in each eye. "We all need something."

  Many of the crew had rushed to the doorway to stowage, investigating the source of the smoke, but Shinna wasn't going to let her out of hae sight.

  Melna said, "Whatever he promised you, it's not coming."

  "He has Holragi's favor. We'll all be in the first colony in the desert."

  "How many people do you think he's said that to?"

  Thi stayed silent, more unsure of haeself than thi had ever been before, but so engrossed in the plan.

  "I am responsible for the survival of my crew," thi said. "You will be sold to Holragi. That is final."

  Shinna took hae coat off of hae back, tossed it on the ground in front of Melna, and then turned around to help hae crew with the fire. There were three people rushing into the smoke with buckets of salt water reserved specifically for fires. They stopped and waited for a woman and a maman carrying Ramne out of the smoke. He was barely aware of what was happening, turning his head left and right, trying to find his eyesight.

  He yelled, "Ginnu. Where is Ginnu."

  But nobody knew who he was talking about. They simply laid him down against the railing on the side of the ship opposite Melna. Through shifting legs and feet, she could see a giant burn against the right side of his body as if the lantern oil had been splattered over his body.

  She couldn't help be laugh.

  

  <!--  -->











<!--
- Holragi wants to use Melna and Liffa as bargaining chips against each other when negotiating with Liffa about communicating with the obscura.
  - If Heiko is blockaded, there needs to be some external force to help them
    - Ulukoma?
      - Setre knows about Holragi's plan to destroy Heiko
      - They would have to plan to help Heiko already.
        - That's what planting Linyu was about
        - Why would they help Heiko?
          - Gain legitimacy in the senate
          - Avenge Kipnu's death
      - Melna and a small army would have to play decoy to try to buy time for Heiko.
        - Gets captured by Holragi's blockade. They kill her army.
      - A blockade by both Holragi and Rudjan would be massive.
        - Part 4:
        - They would have to sneak out secretly. How?
          - Kanosin+Antikan = no breathing for a long time. Swim out in the darkness to a ship only visible underwater (kanosin blue)
            - How does Heiko acquire Kanosin+Antikan?
              - Casra's stash in Shaki Harbor. Linyu+Setre fetch it
                - then arrive in Heiko (during a blockade?!)
                - then smuggle it into Heiko, taking on a disguise.
      - They don't have a navy. But they do have a fearless fighting force.
      - Setre could steal a boat from Rudjan with Linyu's help (going back to what she does best for the greater good)


- infighting as Linyu despises Setre for using Melna as a diversion to save Heiko

- Melna hides
  - Overhears talk about capturing Pomri
    - They didn't find Linyu, but Linyu can't see without antikan

- Pomri has been tricked into taking a train to Shaki
  - This sets up a sacrifice story where Melna has to trade her own life

- Linyu (and Pomri as an alternative) hid from Shaki soldiers and magistrates that had arrived at the train station looking for them. Thi hid for a long time and was guided by Setre+transmitter to a ship.
  - This brings Linyu closer to Antikan, which lets hae see.
  - Linyu can transmit information to Melna now.
    - Linyu can use numbers on their pendants to encrypt messages.
    - Linyu can route Heikoans to Ulukoma
      - If Linyu uncovers that they're now immortal

- Linyu/Pomri encounter Setre who fills them in about Ulukoma
  - and the invulnerability of Kanosin
    - They would still want to go to Shaki to tell the world about Holragi's betrayal.

  "Ramne. Who is Ramne?"

  "I've heard of him," Pomri chimed in. "He used to be some nobody in the Rudjan guard who thought he was smarter than the rest of us. Never got promoted, so he just left us one day without a trace."


  Linyu whimpered in fear at his name, drawing Pomri's attention.

  "Eh? What's gotten into you?" she asked.

  Thi was getting ready to jump off of Laen-Laen and run, but Melna had already become aware of hae and leapt back to hae.

  "Hey, Linyu. What's wrong?" asked Melna, holding onto hae arms.

  "Ramne," thi said in a cracked voice, "He..."

  Tears were forming at the corners of hae eyes.

  "What did he do?"

  "Mom," thi said, at the end of hae wit.




  "I take it you're not a boat person. Well, we can't go back now so you're either coming with us or you're on your own again."

  Thi took a moment, feeling angry at the predicament thi was put into. There was nowhere to run, standing outside a massive city barred from entry, and Laen-Laen, who could take hae anywhere if anywhere were safe anymore. Thi placed hae hand on Kip's pendant under hae shirt and closed hae eyes in thought.

  "Together," thi whispered. Pomri smiled at hae courage.



"The train here is shut down too," Pomri said with disappointment.

"Nevermind that I need to speak with Linyu," said Melna.

"What's gotten into you?" Pomri asked, suspicious.

Melna stooped to Linyu's level and gazed into hae firey blue eyes. She was sure that the woman had them too.

"Do you know a woman named Ginnu and a possibly her partner?" she asked.

Linyu was shocked, "H-How.."

"I need to know, Linyu. Please tell me. Who are they?"

"Kanosin"

"They sell kanosin?"

Thi nodded in confirmation.

"Did you know they are looking for you?"

Hae hands began to tremble and she grasped them in comfort.

"Why are they after you?"

Thi pointed to the listener in hae ear.

"Why is this thing so important? What does it do?"

Thi began to cry but held hae wits together while trying to find a way to explain.

Melna pressed for simpler answers.

"is it a weapon, some new material?"

Thi took the listener off hae ear and gave it to Melna, who hesitantly put it up to her ear.

"I can hear strange static sounds. Where is it coming from?"

Linyu gestured all around, wishing thi had hae transmitter there.

Pomri interjected, "You're wasting your time with this nonsense."

"Wait. I can hear someone talking," she said, still listening intently. She tried to hear the words, but could only hear a few through the noise.

"What are they talking about?" she asked Linyu again.

But instead of an answer Linyu held hae hand up to hae ear, telling her to keep listening.

She listened closer and then heard an unmistakeable voice of the maman who woke up early to sit under a tree. Who dressed her before she went to Shaki and gave her a kiss on the forehead even when thi was unhappy with her.

"Liffa! You're alive!"



  "Please," Melna sniffled and looked down. "Keep mine with you as well. I do not know what fate lies before me, only that it will be dark and obscured from me. It would bring me peace to know that him and I are together in some small way, living apart from ."

  She pressed it tightly against hae chest, taking time to cherish the memories of the man and maman she loved and to remember the oath of protection which she was desparately trying to keep. Her hands lifted the pendant from her neck and place it over Melna's.
