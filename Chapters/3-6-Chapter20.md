## Chapter 20

<!--
Well uhh.. Melna has a higher price being sold to Fajro so she gets to live for now.
Rape scene? idk that's a lot.
this could be where Ramne threatens to rape, but dies
 -->

  *Thump.*

  She repeated the same word. *"Go." "Go."*

  *Thump*

  *"Go"*

  A warm breeze brushed her shoulder and exhaled a sigh across her skin. She was

  *Thump*

  somewhere she shouldn't be.

  *"Get out of there! Go!"*

  *Thump*

  *"Melna, you can't hide. I know you're in there."*

  *Where is here?*

  *"Go"*

  *"GO"*

  She was lifted back into consciousness, her eyes open wide with nothing to see but darkness. A cold tingling sensation filled her body like billions of tiny electric currents running through her muscles as she slowly regained feeling, but remained in a paralyzed state. She resolved that downward must be behind her, keeping her back stiff against the damp floor as she searched for the senses that she did still have. 







<!--
- Holragi wants to use Melna and Liffa as bargaining chips against each other when negotiating with Liffa about communicating with the obscura.
  - If Heiko is blockaded, there needs to be some external force to help them
    - Ulukoma?
      - Setre knows about Holragi's plan to destroy Heiko
      - They would have to plan to help Heiko already.
        - That's what planting Linyu was about
        - Why would they help Heiko?
          - Gain legitimacy in the senate
          - Avenge Kipnu's death
      - Melna and a small army would have to play decoy to try to buy time for Heiko.
        - Gets captured by Holragi's blockade. They kill her army.
      - A blockade by both Holragi and Rudjan would be massive.
        - Part 4:
        - They would have to sneak out secretly. How?
          - Kanosin+Antikan = no breathing for a long time. Swim out in the darkness to a ship only visible underwater (kanosin blue)
            - How does Heiko acquire Kanosin+Antikan?
              - Casra's stash in Shaki Harbor. Linyu+Setre fetch it
                - then arrive in Heiko (during a blockade?!)
                - then smuggle it into Heiko, taking on a disguise.
      - They don't have a navy. But they do have a fearless fighting force.
      - Setre could steal a boat from Rudjan with Linyu's help (going back to what she does best for the greater good)


- infighting as Linyu despises Setre for using Melna as a diversion to save Heiko

- Melna hides
  - Overhears talk about capturing Pomri
    - They didn't find Linyu, but Linyu can't see without antikan

- Pomri has been tricked into taking a train to Shaki
  - This sets up a sacrifice story where Melna has to trade her own life

- Linyu (and Pomri as an alternative) hid from Shaki soldiers and magistrates that had arrived at the train station looking for them. Thi hid for a long time and was guided by Setre+transmitter to a ship.
  - This brings Linyu closer to Antikan, which lets hae see.
  - Linyu can transmit information to Melna now.
    - Linyu can use numbers on their pendants to encrypt messages.
    - Linyu can route Heikoans to Ulukoma
      - If Linyu uncovers that they're now immortal

- Linyu/Pomri encounter Setre who fills them in about Ulukoma
  - and the invulnerability of Kanosin
    - They would still want to go to Shaki to tell the world about Holragi's betrayal.

  "Ramne. Who is Ramne?"

  "I've heard of him," Pomri chimed in. "He used to be some nobody in the Rudjan guard who thought he was smarter than the rest of us. Never got promoted, so he just left us one day without a trace."


  Linyu whimpered in fear at his name, drawing Pomri's attention.

  "Eh? What's gotten into you?" she asked.

  Thi was getting ready to jump off of Laen-Laen and run, but Melna had already become aware of hae and leapt back to hae.

  "Hey, Linyu. What's wrong?" asked Melna, holding onto hae arms.

  "Ramne," thi said in a cracked voice, "He..."

  Tears were forming at the corners of hae eyes.

  "What did he do?"

  "Mom," thi said, at the end of hae wit.




  "I take it you're not a boat person. Well, we can't go back now so you're either coming with us or you're on your own again."

  Thi took a moment, feeling angry at the predicament thi was put into. There was nowhere to run, standing outside a massive city barred from entry, and Laen-Laen, who could take hae anywhere if anywhere were safe anymore. Thi placed hae hand on Kip's pendant under hae shirt and closed hae eyes in thought.

  "Together," thi whispered. Pomri smiled at hae courage.



"The train here is shut down too," Pomri said with disappointment.

"Nevermind that I need to speak with Linyu," said Melna.

"What's gotten into you?" Pomri asked, suspicious.

Melna stooped to Linyu's level and gazed into hae firey blue eyes. She was sure that the woman had them too.

"Do you know a woman named Ginnu and a possibly her partner?" she asked.

Linyu was shocked, "H-How.."

"I need to know, Linyu. Please tell me. Who are they?"

"Kanosin"

"They sell kanosin?"

Thi nodded in confirmation.

"Did you know they are looking for you?"

Hae hands began to tremble and she grasped them in comfort.

"Why are they after you?"

Thi pointed to the listener in hae ear.

"Why is this thing so important? What does it do?"

Thi began to cry but held hae wits together while trying to find a way to explain.

Melna pressed for simpler answers.

"is it a weapon, some new material?"

Thi took the listener off hae ear and gave it to Melna, who hesitantly put it up to her ear.

"I can hear strange static sounds. Where is it coming from?"

Linyu gestured all around, wishing thi had hae transmitter there.

Pomri interjected, "You're wasting your time with this nonsense."

"Wait. I can hear someone talking," she said, still listening intently. She tried to hear the words, but could only hear a few through the noise.

"What are they talking about?" she asked Linyu again.

But instead of an answer Linyu held hae hand up to hae ear, telling her to keep listening.

She listened closer and then heard an unmistakeable voice of the maman who woke up early to sit under a tree. Who dressed her before she went to Shaki and gave her a kiss on the forehead even when thi was unhappy with her.

"Liffa! You're alive!"



  "Please," Melna sniffled and looked down. "Keep mine with you as well. I do not know what fate lies before me, only that it will be dark and obscured from me. It would bring me peace to know that him and I are together in some small way, living apart from ."

  She pressed it tightly against hae chest, taking time to cherish the memories of the man and maman she loved and to remember the oath of protection which she was desparately trying to keep. Her hands lifted the pendant from her neck and place it over Melna's.
