_Th-Thump. Th-Thump. Th-Thump._

The sound of her own pulses filled her head. She found herself standing in the dark upon some kind of metallic shell and staring out into the darkness around her, filled with little dots of light. She took a step and the ground pulled its weight toward her as if in anticipation. Ahead of her, rays of light danced where the ground gave way.

_Th-Thump. Th-Thump. Th-Thump._

A warm breeze sighed across her face and hair as she peered over the precipice and into the light. It was Ara, only brighter and more magnificent. She clambered over the edge and set her foot on the bottom of that metal shell. A familiar face took her hand to help her back up.

"Melna. It's been a while."

"Kipnu? Is that really you?"

"You're in great danger, Melna."

Her mouth and lungs moved through no action of her own. "You don't belong here," she said to herself.

"What is this?" she asked him, panicked, but he took her hand and held her close. He pointed at a shining speck of light drifting at their feet.

Liffa's voice cried out all around her, "Kipnu... Melna..."

She looked up to see hae sitting in the air where Kipnu had been before, but thi couldn't see her. She tried to reach out to hae, but her hand hit an invisible wall that kept them separate.

"I'm here! I'm here!" she cried out to hae, banging on the invisible wall, but Liffa was unreachable.

"I don't know if I'll make it," thi whispered to the air, "I should have listened to you, Melna."

"No, no, you will make it Liffa. Don't talk like that."

"I feel..." thi hesitated as her image began to fade into the light. Melna looked for hae face but it was empty.

"warm."

Then the light around them began to brighten and time began to stutter and skip as everything melted away in the white light. She saw herself a child, insignificant in this infinite abyss.

_Th-Thump. Th-Thump. Th-Thump._

"Melna, what are you doing? Get out of there."

"Just leave her. She can't stay in there forever."

_My parents?_

"We're going to be late. Come out now."

"Melna, you're making your nather angry. OUT!"

_Th-Thump. Th-Thump. Th-Thump._

"OUT!"

She was jolted awake by a hard tug on her left arm. A cold tingling sensation filled her body like billions of tiny electric currents as she slowly regained her sense of touch, of balance, of reality. She searched for her bearings and recognized that downward was behind her, with her back planted against the damp floor. _I'm not dead._

She perused the abilities that she did still have. Her arms wouldn't respond to her commands, but she could feel them just fine. She hoped that it might be temporary. She could feel some kind of vibration through the floor and two ringing noises in her ears: one was of her own physiology, a reminder that something terrible had happened to her. But the other was much lower: the whir of a tireless machine and the wet of the ocean. _A ship. I'm on a ship._

Faintly, she could hear some rustling of another and then she remembered Ramne, the rage on his face so brightly lit by that maman's eyes as he spoked with an inhuman rage. A wave of nauseous fear shook the rest of her body awake and she sprang her head up and observed her surroundings. She found her shirt had been torn from her body and her arms and legs were loosely tied with a strong kelp rope to two wooden pillars on either side of her. With her eyes opened narrowly and her faculties not fully returned, she peered into that hazy darkness and found the faint glimmer of a window through which only a sliver of the sky could be seen.

"You're finally awake," Ramne's unmistakeable voice broke the darkness, and she looked up and back to find his feet upside-down.

He continued, "Had me worried there. I need you alive, you know."

"Fuck. You."

He chuckled, "Still alive, and just as profitable. Nobody told me you were the fabled fidelant from Heiko. Would have been a bit more considerate when I stopped you on that stairwell."

"Fuck. Your consideration."

"Come now, I've apologized, haven't I? You're one of the few that's had such a treat. You should be more thankful."

"If you were sorry, you'd untie me."

"Oh those are for my protection. I know my ways can be a little crude to some people, but where you're going, you'll wish you were back here with me."

She stayed quiet as he made a rustling noise and his boots knocked against the creaky floor. Step by step, he moved slowly toward her, and came to rest at her side. She glanced around for a pair of blue eyes, but didn't see any sign of the maman. A faint whirring sound of a firestarter being warmed startled her and an oil lamp lit up, showing Ramne's smug face and lustful eyes staring at hers. There is no other displeasure quite like being the prey of another's eye. She felt it at Heiko station: How the two looked at her with a hungry gaze, eyeing her satchel and her saffa. She felt it in Fajro's presence, his face a thin mask to hide his lustful thoughts. And now she knew it most here, in the presence of some narcissistic lunatic.

"Holrag is looking for you, you know," he said. "And they're promising a hefty reward."

She laughed at her own naïveté. "Shinna's idea, I suppose. What makes you think they'll actually pay it?"

"You see these crates all around you? This is what keeps civilization from toppling on itself. The sweet blue nectar that brings such peace and sustenance to those who imbibe."

"You keep them enslaved."

"Hey, if kanosin is so bad they should stop begging me for more."

"You would be the first to die if they could."

"But they won't," he laughed, "They won't, and that's the beauty of it."

He tilted the lamp over the ground between them and watched the flames crawl down the stream of oil and onto a growing pool on the floor. The smell of anomin filled the air as flames bit at her side, inching ever closer. She tried her best to think clearly and focus on escaping.

"The senate. It doesn't have any real power, does it?" he spoke softly. "The people give you the power to choose and you use that power to enact the will of whoever has the most power over you."

He poured out a little more and the flames began to singe her skin a little. She let out an agitated whimper but caught herself to avoid giving him the satisfaction he so desperately craved.

"But you don't have money in Heiko. No promise of riches can buy your favor, only the people of Heiko have that privilege."

He leaned in closer and pulled Melna's face to look at him in the eye.

"You don't know my power yet. It goes beyond money, beyond politics. Beyond even the obscura. As the last of your people become desparate and hungry and lifeless fleeing from their home, hiding from the Holragi, they _will_ turn to me. As will everyone else on this planet."

He moved the lamp over her, taking some perverted satisfaction in watching her suffer.

"Feel my power."

He poured the hot oil down upon her chest and it boiled the water in her hydroderm and singed her outer flesh. She shrieked in agony and gesticulated against her bindings, trying desparately to get the oil off as the flames spread across the surface and consumed her body. Her skin hissed with pressure and burst in small pops that bled water onto her and let the oil inside. And all while her burns grew in intensity and size, Ramne held a sadistic smile on his face.

Suddenly there was a flash at the other end of the room and then a shuffling of feet. The lantern moved away from her and jumped about the room in confused flickers. Melna was focused on her burns so she didn't notice when the lantern fell and a crate was engulfed on the other side of the room.

A blanket fell on her and a pair of hands smothered the fire on her body. She cried out from the sting of the pressure, but the blanket came off quickly after and the fire had been put out. She looked up, relieved, and saw the massive fire roaring behind two familiar eyes that were no longer blue.

"You can see," Melna said confusedly.

"We don't have much time," the maman said as thi was untying the binds around Melna's arms. "We need to get out of here before the smoke suffocates us."

Melna's hands became free and she immediately lifted herself up and roared through the pain at the movement of her skin. Smoke from the wooden crate was beginning to fill the air and warn them that they had little time. The maman untied Melna's ankles from the post and helped her to stand up. She glanced back at the fire and didn't see Ramne anywhere, but had no time to ask qustions. Hastily, they climbed the stairs as quickly as they could and opened the door to a chilling wind and the dimmest light of Ara to guide them. Glass lanterns were hung where the crew had staked their claims on the deck. Melna looked further toward Ara and saw the shape of the land at a distance. She estimated it to be swimmable, but only just.

"Can you swim?" asked Melna.

"It's the only way," thi said. "There are no boats here."

They snuck quietly to the side of the ship and looked down into the dark water below.

"Do you have the strength?" Melna asked hae.

"I am not afraid to die," thi said with conviction as thi lifted herself onto the railing, "I am afraid to stay."

Melna nodded again and lifted herself onto the railing as well, imagining for a second the pain she would feel with salt on her wounds. A shout came from behind them saying "Stop!" It was Shinna but thi was too far to stop them.

Melna turned to the maman and in a moment, passed her pendant to hae and said, "Don't wait for me. Find a silver-furred saffa once you reach land. Laen-Lean."

"What are you doing?"

"GO!" said Melna, and she pushed hae off the railing, ensuring thi had safely surfaced before turning to face Shinna.

"Don't jump! All of us can outswim you," Shinna yelled. Thi was standing only a few paces away from her. Melna looked back to the maman who was waiting in the water, and was tempted to jump in after hae. But Melna knew that would only be more troublesome for the both of them. She waited until she saw the maman start to swim off toward land and then let herself down off of the railing. Shinna's face was visibly horrified to see her scars.

"I thought I could trust you," Melna said. "But you were planning to sell me for ransom all along."

Thi hesitated with a half a tear stuck in each eye. "We all need something."

Many of the crew had rushed to the doorway to stowage, investigating the source of the smoke, but Shinna wasn't going to let her out of hae sight.

Melna said, "Whatever Fajro promised you, it will not come."

"We will all be part of the Red Circle. The first colony in the desert."

"How many people do you think he's made that promise to?"

Thi stayed silent, more unsure of haeself than thi had ever been before, but too engrossed in the plan to give up now.

"I am responsible for the survival of my crew," thi said with a cracked voice. "You will be sold to Holrag. That is final."

Shinna took the coat off of hae back, tossed it on the ground in front of Melna, and then turned around to help hae crew. Melna quickly took the coat and laid it over her body as she curled up against the railing, looking on at the busy people before her. Three people rushed into the smoke with buckets of ocean water reserved for fighting fires. They stopped and waited for a woman and a maman carrying Ramne out of the smoke. He was barely aware of what was happening, turning his head left and right, trying to find his bearings.

He yelled, "Ginnu. Melna. Where are they?"

But nobody knew who he was talking about. They laid him down against the railing on the side of the ship opposite Melna. Through shifting legs and feet she could see a giant burn against the right side of his body, as if someone had intentionally splattered the lantern oil had been splattered over his body.

She couldn't help but laugh over her pain.

Shinna came back to Melna and said, "I don't know what you two did down there but you almost set the whole ship ablaze."

Melna kept her eyes fixed on Ramne, never letting his new disfigured form out of her memory.

"And who is Ginnu?", thi paused for response but Melna was silent, never taking her eyes off of Ramne. "Are you hearing me?"

"A man like that is worth dying to kill", said Melna. "Don't you agree?"

Shinna looked at Ramne and back at Melna, with a look of anguish on hae face.

"I had the chance many times... I'd have done it if my life didn't depend on keeping him alive."

Thi tossed her hands up in exasperation, voicing a "Shb'paahh!", and walked away to return to hae crew.

Melna kept looking at Ramne as he slowly regained his bearings. The crew crowded around him, giving him water and nursing his wounds and it made her sick to watch them pander to him. She stood up slowly, holding the coat tightly to her chest, and looked out on the water again. There was no sign of the maman anymore. Just the dark outlines of waves.

"Live well, new friend. You've earned it."

<!--
- Holrag wants to use Melna and Liffa as bargaining chips against each other when negotiating with Liffa about communicating with the obscura.
  - If Heiko is blockaded, there needs to be some external force to help them
    - Ulukoma?
      - Setre knows about Holrag's plan to destroy Heiko
      - They would have to plan to help Heiko already.
        - That's what planting Linyu was about
        - Why would they help Heiko?
          - Gain legitimacy in the senate
          - Avenge Kipnu's death
      - Melna and a small army would have to play decoy to try to buy time for Heiko.
        - Gets captured by Holrag's blockade. They kill her army.
      - A blockade by both Holrag and Rudjan would be massive.
        - Part 4:
        - They would have to sneak out secretly. How?
          - Kanosin+Antikan = no breathing for a long time. Swim out in the darkness to a ship only visible underwater (kanosin blue)
            - How does Heiko acquire Kanosin+Antikan?
              - Casra's stash in Shaki Harbor. Linyu+Setre fetch it
                - then arrive in Heiko (during a blockade?!)
                - then smuggle it into Heiko, taking on a disguise.
      - They don't have a navy. But they do have a fearless fighting force.
      - Setre could steal a boat from Rudjan with Linyu's help (going back to what she does best for the greater good)


- infighting as Linyu despises Setre for using Melna as a diversion to save Heiko

- Melna hides
  - Overhears talk about capturing Pomri
    - They didn't find Linyu, but Linyu can't see without antikan

- Pomri has been tricked into taking a train to Shaki
  - This sets up a sacrifice story where Melna has to trade her own life

- Linyu (and Pomri as an alternative) hid from Shaki soldiers and magistrates that had arrived at the train station looking for them. Thi hid for a long time and was guided by Setre+transmitter to a ship.
  - This brings Linyu closer to Antikan, which lets hae see.
  - Linyu can transmit information to Melna now.
    - Linyu can use numbers on their pendants to encrypt messages.
    - Linyu can route Heikoi to Ulukoma
      - If Linyu uncovers that they're now immortal

- Linyu/Pomri encounter Setre who fills them in about Ulukoma
  - and the invulnerability of Kanosin
    - They would still want to go to Shaki to tell the world about Holrag's betrayal.

  "Ramne. Who is Ramne?"

  "I've heard of him," Pomri chimed in. "He used to be some nobody in the Rudjan guard who thought he was smarter than the rest of us. Never got promoted, so he just left us one day without a trace."


  Linyu whimpered in fear at his name, drawing Pomri's attention.

  "Eh? What's gotten into you?" she asked.

  Thi was getting ready to jump off of Laen-Laen and run, but Melna had already become aware of hae and leapt back to hae.

  "Hey, Linyu. What's wrong?" asked Melna, holding onto hae arms.

  "Ramne," thi said in a cracked voice, "He..."

  Tears were forming at the corners of hae eyes.

  "What did he do?"

  "Mom," thi said, at the end of hae wit.




  "I take it you're not a boat person. Well, we can't go back now so you're either coming with us or you're on your own again."

  Thi took a moment, feeling angry at the predicament thi was put into. There was nowhere to run, standing outside a massive city barred from entry, and Laen-Laen, who could take hae anywhere if anywhere were safe anymore. Thi placed hae hand on Kipnu's pendant under hae shirt and closed hae eyes in thought.

  "Together," thi whispered. Pomri smiled at hae courage.



"The train here is shut down too," Pomri said with disappointment.

"Nevermind that I need to speak with Linyu," said Melna.

"What's gotten into you?" Pomri asked, suspicious.

Melna stooped to Linyu's level and gazed into hae firey blue eyes. She was sure that the woman had them too.

"Do you know a woman named Ginnu and a possibly her partner?" she asked.

Linyu was shocked, "H-How.."

"I need to know, Linyu. Please tell me. Who are they?"

"Kanosin"

"They sell kanosin?"

Thi nodded in confirmation.

"Did you know they are looking for you?"

Hae hands began to tremble and she grasped them in comfort.

"Why are they after you?"

Thi pointed to the listener in hae ear.

"Why is this thing so important? What does it do?"

Thi began to cry but held hae wits together while trying to find a way to explain.

Melna pressed for simpler answers.

"is it a weapon, some new material?"

Thi took the listener off hae ear and gave it to Melna, who hesitantly put it up to her ear.

"I can hear strange static sounds. Where is it coming from?"

Linyu gestured all around, wishing thi had hae transmitter there.

Pomri interjected, "You're wasting your time with this nonsense."

"Wait. I can hear someone talking," she said, still listening intently. She tried to hear the words, but could only hear a few through the noise.

"What are they talking about?" she asked Linyu again.

But instead of an answer Linyu held hae hand up to hae ear, telling her to keep listening.

She listened closer and then heard an unmistakeable voice of the maman who woke up early to sit under a tree. Who dressed her before she went to Shaki and gave her a kiss on the forehead even when thi was unhappy with her.

"Liffa! You're alive!"



  "Please," Melna sniffled and looked down. "Keep mine with you as well. I do not know what fate lies before me, only that it will be dark and obscured from me. It would bring me peace to know that him and I are together in some small way, living apart from ."

  She pressed it tightly against hae chest, taking time to cherish the memories of the man and maman she loved and to remember the oath of protection which she was desparately trying to keep. Her hands lifted the pendant from her neck and place it over Melna's.
