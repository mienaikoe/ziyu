"Who is this?" I stammered with cloudy breaths at two figures in the distance. One was Pomri, by her walk, but the other seemed unfamiliar.

"Jesse's the name," he said.

Pomri stepped into my recognition and I gave her a cold look of distrust, but she deflected it and brought me her smile, one that told of a plan.

I asked Jesse suspiciously, "Why do you want to come with us? There is danger ahead."

"If a kaln can..."

He caught himself before the scowl on my face had fully developed.

"I know... that great danger lies ahead," he said hesitantly. "The truth is that I have some unfinished business at the observatory that–"

"The observatory?"

"Yes, w–"

"You're an observer?"

"...Indeed, yo–"

"You did nothing to prepare them," I lunged to grab him, "You knew the trajectories, you knew what was headed for them, but you did nothing!"

"Enough!" Pomri pushed me away from the cowering observer.

"The data...," he tried to recover his words, tossed about him, "I-I wanted to be sure-"

"Linyu," Pomri stopped him with an arm. "Jesse is a loyal servant of Heiko. He did his best with what he had."

He looked at me with guilt in his eyes, as if he was already acutely aware of his error. But I needed him to know where I stood.

"There are good decisions and bad decisions," I said, "But indecision is worse than both. My mother taught me that before she died."

I turned to Pomri and said, "He cannot come with us."

"Linyu-" she interjected, but he stammered out a plea.

"P-Please. I must go back to the observatory at all costs."

"Why? What's so important that you have to risk our lives to get there?"

He glanced at Pomri who waved her hand for him to say his peace.

"I know what the obscura are doing. But we need to know when."
