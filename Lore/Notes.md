## Notes for Edit Mode:

- Show some internal marriage struggles in Chapter 1, 2 beyond just Mel keeping secrets.
  - Kipnu's struggle is caring about his family, but chasing his fantasies, wanting to cheat.
    - He gives in, and looks to redeem himself
  - Lif's struggle is self-confidence, doubt, fear
  - Mel's struggle is anxiety, paranoia, trust


- Consider making the interlogue into a separate chapter where Mel is informed of what happened.

- Chapter 9 should be lengthened with details about how the bidding ends with a dramatic bid by Casra.
