## Notes for Edit Mode:


### Part 1
- Show some internal marriage struggles in Chapter 1, 2 beyond just Mel keeping secrets.
  - Kipnu's struggle is caring about his family, but chasing his fantasies, wanting to cheat.
    - He gives in, and looks to redeem himself
  - Lif's struggle is self-confidence, doubt, fear
  - Mel's struggle is anxiety, paranoia, trust

- Add a pet for Lif to talk to. It also shows primitive technology for society.
  - Maybe the pet can be horse-like to replace bikes

- Make the city come alive in ch 3 instead of just rando getting a roll to eat.

- Consider making the interlogue into a separate chapter where Mel is informed of what happened.

- Chapter 9 should be lengthened with details about how the bidding ends with a dramatic bid by Casra.

- It never rains.

- Show the fervor of industrial revolution in depictions of Shaki or trains.

### Part 2
- Make Kip incredulous and fearful of what he saw in his dreams - unable to separate reality from dream, until Casra gives him the antidote.

- Kip should be untrusting of Casra at first. Why didn't they tell him what to expect if they had been there?
  - There wasn't time? Kip is worthless unless Lissa knows his worth - Kip is a lure?

- Maybe the trees can tune themselves - Wood rings as capacitors and spiraling branches as coils. Evolutionary for plant communication across great distances.

- Introduce a species of bird to Ulukoma, and then when Lin + Kip climb the tree, have some foreshadowing where Kip knocks a nest down accidentally, and Lin saves the eggs. (Perhaps future books can have Lin be some hero?)

- More description of Ramne, Linyu, Lissa, Setre, and Ginnu.
  - Give Ramne a lot of concealment. Make it almost impossible to spot him.

- Make some triple non-hetero

- Make note of how firewood works in the Shadestead

- Depict Lissa as a dream-goddess to Kipnu on the come-down from Kanosin

- Does Lissa have very ornate light flow-tattoo patterns? If so, you should really accentuate this.

- Depict Shadesteaders as believing that the polyamorous raised-by-a-village way of life is utopian. Both Lissa and Casra believe this despite their ideological differences on slavery and addiction.

- Linyu died or not? If thi does, you should make it as ornate as Casra's death.
  - Maybe Linyu is unconscious.
  - Setre saying "Lin...Lin" is unnecessarily ominous.

- Days should be depicted as being longer than 3 earth days (amounts of Ma'To and La'To might have to be adjusted as well)

- "We know truth not only by reason but also by heart"

Option3: Lissa has a covert army of moles and manipulators in every tribe, in Shaki and in the shadestead, slowly converting people with blackmail and bribery. Impossible to fight directly.
  - Most realistic
  - This would be interesting to plot Casra against Kip.
    - But what could I do after that? Kip alone is useless. Would he demonstrate his trustworthiness?
    - Kip's main goal is to figure out the antenna tech and get off of Ulu.
      - He also wants to save Casra and Linyu.
  - They use the antenna array to start a secret resistance movement.
    - They learn amplitude mod and bring this tech to Heiko.
    - Kip hears Lif on the radio after their network succeeds to thwart Lissa.
    - Casra builds a new society in Ulu and prepares for the ice age.

- Robots are actually a diffuse neural cloud of microscopic phototransistors

End
  - Casra and Linyu leave with Kip.
  - Mel uses Kip's technology when she visits the obstruction to control the robots to block the bombs otherwise they would hit Heiko.
    - Robots build would cause a dichotomy: (radio societies could control the robots, non-radio societies would die off. The great filter. Why? Proof of advancement. Proof of work. Proof of research. Only societies that can cooperate and contribute to the last question are permitted to survive. Otherwise, their planet's resources are stripped and their star is harvested.)

    the population is growing too rapidly for a planet to survive war and pollution. They either:
      - kill off their population
        - Holragi's approach
      - convince the AI that they can curtail their growth
        - Lif: "They need a sign of good faith, and they'll give us 10 years."
      - destroy the AI and solve the problem later
        - Readers would hate humanity for kicking the can down the road
      - Deliver the message in the next book
        - This would be like mass effect
