## Notes for Edit Mode:


### Part 1
- Show some internal marriage struggles in Chapter 1, 2 beyond just Mel keeping secrets.
  - Kipnu's struggle is caring about his family, but chasing his fantasies, wanting to cheat.
    - He gives in, and looks to redeem himself
  - Lif's struggle is self-confidence, doubt, fear
  - Mel's struggle is anxiety, paranoia, trust
  - Lif asks Mel if she is pregnant (show they've been trying but Mel is keeping a secret from them that she's preventing it somehow)

- Somehow explain how the time system works,

- Accentuate the train pipes

- Make the city come alive in ch 3 instead of just rando getting a roll to eat.

- City smells, tastes, sounds, dialog with strangers

- More Deep Hard Scifi talk in the senate about what the obscura could be.
  - Show off their level of technology, philosophy, and astronomy.
  - Clarify that Heiko supplies astronomy and biology research to the world (agrarian culture).

- Fajro should be depicted as almost reptilian though human-like

- Consider making the interlogue into a separate chapter where Mel is informed of what happened.

- It never rains. Is this accurate?

- Portray Kipnu as a bombastic anti hero. Went into the medical profession to save lives (and for the glory)

- Show the fervor of industrial revolution in depictions of Shaki or trains.

### Part 2

- Make Kip incredulous and fearful of what he saw in his dreams - unable to separate reality from dream, until Casra gives him the antidote.

- Kip's supressed desires thing comes out of nowhere. Introduce this earlier in the book.

- Kip should be untrusting of Casra at first. Why didn't they tell him what to expect if they had been there?
  - There wasn't time? Kip is worthless unless Lissa knows his worth - Kip is a lure?

- Kanosin is made out of Bluekelp, and is addicting.
  - Secretly: This is how bluekelp evolved. It keeps people alive and addicted so they keep coming back to it to    spread its spores through the water or through Kanosin.
  - Secretly: Kanosin responds to radio and can be used for mind control.

- Lissa mentions that doctors like Kip give her great customers
  - Hinting at the opioid crisis

- Casra tried to kill Lissa before but it didn't work, but it's not obviously the bluekelp, just subtly.

- Maybe the trees can tune themselves - Wood rings as capacitors and spiraling branches as coils. Evolutionary for plant communication across great distances.

- Introduce a species of bird to Ulukoma, and then when Lin + Kip climb the tree, have some foreshadowing where Kip knocks a nest down accidentally, and Lin saves the eggs. (Perhaps future books can have Lin be some hero?)

- DO NOT VILLIFY Ulukoma's sexual society. Only villify its drug problem under Lissa. Hint about Casra's approval and partaking in the sexual society as well.

- More description of Ramne, Linyu, Lissa, Setre, and Ginnu.
  - Give Ramne a lot of concealment. Make it almost impossible to spot him.

- Make some triple non-hetero

- Make note of how firewood works in the Shadestead

- Ginnu should be maman

- Depict Lissa as a dream-goddess to Kipnu on the come-down from Kanosin
  - Especially good with Lissa's Non-Dying Lore

- Talk about Linyu a bit more - make it clear there's a problem even though Linyu doesn't die.

- Be a bit more clear on Lissa's destiny.
  - Ramne might hint to Kip that he can't die in the darkness.
    - "Nobody dies in the darkness, Kip. The light brings all the bad news that it can."
    - Hints at ties to strange dark cavern and machine things.
    - Some strange miracle with Penyi to further suggest some sort of eternal life.
  - Lissa says that Casra wanted to die along - terminal illness.
    - This was her last stand against me.
  -PROBLEM:
    - people have to die at Ulukoma for Ramne to gain power by his secret
    - and for Lissa to show humanity, and then remorse.
    - ***Ramne controls who dies and who lives.***
      - Penyi lives because she makes a good slave?
      - Lissa kills haeself and Ramne resurrects hae out of spite (Lissa redemption arc)
      - Casra is not resurrected because Ramne let that ship sail long ago
      - Setre escapes

- Days should be depicted as being longer than 3 earth days (amounts of Ma'To and La'To might have to be adjusted as well)

- "We know truth not only by reason but also by heart" <- what?

- Embalming in salt - salt graves

- Make it clear Lissa has died before


#### Hidden ending of part 2:
- Kipnu drowns trying to save Casra
  - Setre survives and finds Kipnu's body in the ocean
  - Lissa gave him antikan so he could feel pain from the knife, so he can't be resurrected.
- Ramne assumes control over Ulukoma
- Ginnu dies in the basement
  - but is resurrected because of Kanosin in her blood at death.
  - She remains Ramne's slave, as she is blind.
  - but pretends not to know because she intends to kill Ramne.
- Linyu dies at the hand of Ramne in strangulation
  - Linyu is reviving (Coma)
  - Setre brings Linyu to flee Ramne-controlled Ulukoma
  - They head to Kipnu's home in search of Melna
  - Setre must hide because she is in the ranks of the kanosin trade but not high enough to be protected.
  - She was also a prolific thief before landing in Ulukoma.
- Casra is definitely dead, but unclear whether the kelps upload their brains.


### Interlogue
- Make it clearer when the transition between the tunnel and leaving the tunnel happens.
- Reword, don't add.



### Part 3

- War as a catalyst for social reform

- Lin should notice Mel's pendant without Mel bringing it up as a change of subject



### Part 4

- Oberth Effect
  - The Oberth effect is strongest at a point in orbit known as the periapsis, where the gravitational potential is lowest, and the speed is highest. This is because firing a rocket engine at high speed causes a greater change in kinetic energy than when fired at lower speed. Because the vehicle remains near periapsis only for a short time, for the Oberth maneuver to be most effective the vehicle must be able to generate as much impulse as possible in the shortest possible time.

- Option 1: Uplift Gone Wrong
  - Summary
    - The obscura wanted to uplift the civilization but, end up lifting up the strong civilizations: Holragi
    - They block the sun to stop Holragi and force the nation to unify.
    - Holragi fights back, but are futile.
    - Volcanic areas like Ulukom become a fallback.
      - Forebears of life survived there against the same AI. How?
    - Book 2 would focus on their stalemate
  - Theme
    - Uplifting is best done through radio, but is also a filter for communities that have radio.
    - Technology of any kind can be a catalyst for political destabilization
    - First Contact with a k-3 AI will likely be peaceful with the AI, and violent with every entity vying for
    - Robots build would cause a split in the species: (radio societies could control the robots, non-radio societies would die off. The great filter. Why? Proof of advancement. Proof of work. Proof of research. Only societies that can cooperate and contribute to the last question are permitted to survive. Otherwise, their planet's resources are stripped and their star is harvested.)
    - Plot Hole: Why is biological life needed for the final question? AI can do it more efficiently. access.
    - Life is designed for survival. AI is designed for redundancy.

- Option 2: Energy Harvest
  - Summary
    - The obscura are harvesting as many stars as possible for the final problem
    - They assume life no longer exists, so are unprotected from attack
  - Theme
    - K-1 life might have a home-turf advantage against a k-3 AI that is unprepared for attack
    - Is the final problem worth it?

- Option 3: Gods
  - Black Hole Planet
    - The metal gods below are preserving life
    - the metal gods above want to destroy it
      - the population is growing too rapidly for a planet to survive war and pollution. They either:
        - kill off their population
          - Holragi's approach
        - destroy the AI and solve the problem later
          - Readers would hate their own species for kicking the can down the road on similar problems.
        - Deliver the message in the next book
          - This would be like mass effect

- Option 4: Great Filter
  - The obscura know that immortality is the great filter upon which civilization falls
    - The obscura found it (how?) and are trying to kill it
      - They don't know it's volcanically active
  - The mitochondria are the bringers of life, the immortochondria are bringers of death
  - mitochondria were an invention by a that was sent across the galaxy to create sentient life
  - immortochondria were meant to immortalize that life, but it turned out to be a great filter because every society had an imbalance that was exacerbated by the presence of immortochondria.
