### Vowels
Vowels are considered a continuous 2-dimensional map of sounds. The Throat Dimension, and the Lip Dimension. There are no definite letters, only a general location. The meaning of a word is inferred from the sound, instead of a certain letter. 
In Writing, these spectrums are reflected in a single "Vowel Letter" that has variations that reflect the throat and lip dimensions.

**(Throat,Lip)**

	Ah(0,0) - Ai(1,0) - Ee(2,0)
	Oh(0,1) - Oo(1,1) - öö(2,1)
