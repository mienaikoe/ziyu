# Character Arcs

## Lif

Has a major arc where she goes from self-reliant and afraid to heroic and vulnerable to her family, but thi maintains chaotic good throughout the story. Thi has constant imposter syndrome about hae own life.

## Mel

Is a lawful neutral character that believes in Lif's purpose, but isn't in a position to make decisions from a non-consensus standpoint. She does not have a major arc, but remains true to her promises to her family and her nation, even if she has to keep secrets from both of them sometimes to maintain order.

## Kip

Is a character that starts out bored with life and becomes obsessed with sense of duty and heroism, to a fault.


# Main Plot Point

Option A)
  The Palinians live around a white dwarf, huddled in the last remnants of the universe. Invasive robots are moving in to harvest the intense energy of the white dwarf. Palinians become divided on what to do as they are forced to migrate and start a new life closer to the sunward side of the planet.

Option B)
  By the end, reveal that the robots were created by the progenitors of the Palinians. They invented three sexes and hid all oil and rare earth metals as a way to maintain population growth so the planet could remain in equilibrium with the species. The ring is an ancient orbiting station for prepping for space travel from the surface. The robots are detecting that the palinians are becoming too technologically advanced and are aiming to make an ice age to slow their progress. Sequels might feature battles where the robots are attempting to invade to complete their goals.

  Theme: The tragedy of the commons is not inevitable, and the debate around that.

  Some archaeological zealots (the Arkeza party) believe the word of the progenitors as if it were law, and believe the tragedy of the commons is the inevitable, natural law and they wish to withold the truth so they can control the thinning of the population and gain power. These are pure rationalists that abide by historical evidence only. They believe there is very little difference between progenitors and Palinians, that corruption and consumption are a rampant given in their society. The  Mel is secretly one of these.

  Kip abstains from the debate and simply wishes to perform his duties of healing.

  Lif wants to stop the robots by launching from the ring to L1 and destabilizing the satellites. She falls in line with psychologists and futurists (the Palinian Pride party) that believe the progenitors had a flawed society that caused them to fall. Rather than assuming, as in capitalism, that people are greedy and reactively punishing for it, it is better to reward social behavior and initiative. They believe that their society and physiology is flawed, but not so much to cause a collapse the size of humans if their technology goes unchecked. It was the fault of the progenitors' two sexes and corrupt government that led them to have a population boom and a government that couldn't move quickly enough to keep consumption in check from the greed of capitalism.
