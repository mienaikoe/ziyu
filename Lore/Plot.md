# Character Arcs

## Lif

Has a major arc where she goes from self-reliant and afraid to heroic and vulnerable to her family, but thi maintains chaotic good throughout the story. Thi has constant imposter syndrome about hae own life.

## Mel

Is a lawful neutral character that believes in Lif's purpose, but isn't in a position to make decisions from a non-consensus standpoint. She does not have a major arc, but remains true to her promises to her family and her nation, even if she has to keep secrets from both of them sometimes to maintain order.

## Kip

Is a character that starts out bored with life and becomes obsessed with sense of duty and heroism, to a fault.


# Main Plot Point



Option A)
  There is a large robotic construction effort happening at L1 of Palinan's orbit. At first, the Palinians believe that some alien species are trying to kill the sentient life on the planet by forcing an ice age, but when they send research missions, they realize the entire structure is built by robots who are trying to shield the planet from:

  option 1) the radiation and shock wave of their binary stars creating a nova. This, in an effort to preserve the life on the planet. The robots are of mysterious origin.

  option 2) A large solar flare [unpredictable]

  option 3) Helium Flash from Ara

  option 4) A large incoming asteroid (can be from anywhere)

  option 5) A gamma ray burst

Option B)
  The Palinians live around a white dwarf, huddled in the last remnants of the universe. Invasive robots are moving in to harvest the intense energy of the white dwarf. Palinians become divided on what to do as they are forced to migrate and start a new life closer to the sunward side of the planet.
