# Character Arcs

## Lif

Has a major arc where she goes from self-reliant and afraid to heroic and vulnerable to her family, but thi maintains chaotic good throughout the story. Thi has constant imposter syndrome about hae own life.

## Mel

Is a lawful neutral character that believes in Lif's purpose, but isn't in a position to make decisions from a non-consensus standpoint. She does not have a major arc, but remains true to her promises to her family and her nation, even if she has to keep secrets from both of them sometimes to maintain order.

## Kip

Is a character that starts out bored with life and becomes obsessed with sense of duty and heroism, to a fault. He is torn between Lif and Mel.

# Theme
Is the tragedy of the commons inevitable? Can people unite in foregoing their own benefits for the greater benefit of all?


# Main Plot Point

## Part I

  The Palinians live around a white dwarf, huddled in the last remnants of the universe. Invasive robots are moving in to harvest the intense energy of the white dwarf with a dyson sphere. Palinians become divided on what to do as they are forced to migrate and start a new life closer to the sunward side of the planet. The Palinians decide to send a vessel up to investigate, which Lif sneaks aboard. As they approach, they find not a sphere, but a circle of thin woven steel centered at L1. When they board and explore a central "base", they find evidence of a robotic hivemind that tries to communicate with them. It reveals that the robots were created by the progenitors of the Palinians. They bred out curiosity genes and destroyed all oil and rare earth metals as a way to maintain population and technology growth so the planet could remain in equilibrium with the species. The robots are detecting that the palinians are becoming too technologically advanced and are aiming to make an ice age to slow their progress. Lif and Co. attempt to find a way to stop it, but it is unstoppable. They relay this information to the Senate.
  
  
## Part II
  Jes relays a message to Mel and Kip that on the return journey, the vessel was given incorrect navigation waypoints and  landed hard on the ground somewhere in Ulu. Kip and Mel are distraught with Lif's outcome, but Mel remains stoic while Kip breaks down. Mel vows to find the culprit and launches an investigation. Kip remains hung up continuously. The pain doesn't go away.
  A Tova'La after the incident, some archaeological zealots (the Arkeza party) believe the word of the progenitors as if it were law, and believe the tragedy of the commons is the natural law and they wish to sustain the ice age so they can control the famine and thinning of the population to gain power. These are pure rationalists that abide by what the hivemind AI has said. They believe there is very little difference between progenitors and Palinians, that corruption and consumption are a logical conclusion in society, and that the only way to sustain life is to pull it back from time to time. 
  Psychologists and futurists (the Palinian Pride party) believe the progenitors had a flawed society that caused them to fall. Rather than assuming, as in capitalism, that people are greedy and reactively punishing for it, they believe it is better to reward social behavior and initiative and that is how Palinian culture works. They believe that their society and physiology is flawed, but not so much to cause a collapse the size of humans if their technology goes unchecked. It was the fault of the progenitors' obsession with technology and corrupt government that led them to have a population boom and a government that couldn't move quickly enough to stop it.
   Kip fights with Mel about caring about these sides and the importance of family. Then goes on a quest into Ulu with his mother, Cas, to find Lif or hae body. It's cold af, but they find a settlement of sorts that appears abandoned. They are kidnapped into an underground civilization called Shayadja where they find remnants of the vessel, and no sign of Lif. They learn how to survive in the dark with geothermal power, food, and water. Though the Shayadj cannot take their population in, Kip and Cas can bring this knowledge and some samples back and possibly save those who work hard enough to prepare. They do this for Lif's memory.
   Kip and Cas return to the house only to find it dim (almost like an eclipse) and the garden barren except for the Ziyu tree. Heiko central has become a ghost town. They walk further toward the remaining light of Ara and find lots of Heikoans huddled around fires. Eating rationed rolls. They mention that the Senators chose stay behind in the capital and to evacuate everyone closer to the Ara desert while still close enough for the strongest to ferry rations from home. There were lots of problems with looting and theft (feeding into the Arkeza narrative), and so they chose Arkeza members to police them. Naturally, the Arkeza were gaining power by playing judge and jury for Pride members, separating them into the more barren parts of their new homes. Kip and Cas go to face Mel and the senate in the capital.


## Part III
  
  The only people remaining in the capital are looters who are squatting in random shops in the dark. Mel has a stockpile of food in a safehouse near the senate, and she goes there armed to find food for the senators and keep some leverage against them.
  When Kip approaches the capital, he stalks Mel to find out how to access her and decided to do it when she's on her food run. They have a talk and she assumes the worst, but Kip instead brings up the Shayadj. Mel breaks down and admits she can't stop thinking about Lif either and that the investigation went nowhere since there was so much else to prepare for. They make up and plan out how to get their people to dig underground in a short time with the Arkeza in power. They use the food leverage to appoint Cas as the leader for an underground farming project for Heiko only - Mel wasn't able to negotiate for everyone. Kip decides to stay behind and help his mother, while Mel decided to take another vessel and see if she can stop the sphere herself.
   When she arrives, she is greeted by Lif. Seemingly impossible, Mel explains that Lif died in the crash. Lif denies it, saying she had been there the whole time, eating and drinking whatever the robots could make (which is everything). *Lingering Question: Is this Lif a remake or the original? Does it matter? Aggravate the reader a bit for a sequel.* Real brain fuck figuring out if Mel should take this Lif with her, but she does. The three of them re-unite in the Heiko settlement. Mel and Lif agree not to tell Kip what happened until he dies.
