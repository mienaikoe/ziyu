## Character Arcs

### Lif(fa)
Has a major arc where thi goes from self-reliant and afraid to heroic and vulnerable to hae family, but thi maintains chaotic good throughout the story. Thi has constant imposter syndrome about hae own life. Lif is chaotic good and supports the pride party that wants to do stop the robots. Thi wants to participate in government and believes it's the most important thing to do.

### Mel(na)
Is a lawful neutral character that believes in Lif's purpose, but isn't in a position to make decisions from a non-consensus standpoint. She remains true to her promises to her family and her nation, even if she has to keep secrets from both of them sometimes to maintain order. She has major trust, paranoia, and anxiety issues and has to learn to seek help from her family to get through her upcoming struggle. Kip's return brings a well of "I told you so" to her mind, and she has to learn to trust Kip when he brings other useful news like wireless communication with Lif.

### Kip(nu)
Is a character that starts out bored with life and has lots of dreams and fantasies. Some of them taboo and secretive. He ends up chasing them too far, and becomes entangled in a deep well of doubt that he then must pull himself out of and save his family in some very unsexy ways.



## Themes
- Is the tragedy of the commons inevitable? Can people unite in foregoing their own benefits for the greater benefit of all?
- Is it possible for a society to thrive in knowledge and prosperity without the use of oil or rare earths?
- How important is family vs state? Should a politician always hold state first, or is there something to be said about fostering a strong family that can save you when the state turns against you?
- Can AI be evil? Can logic be evil? At the very least, can it be too sure of itself?
- Is it good and is it practical to stay neutral in an ideological conflict and just focus on your own family's survival?
- Are we alone?
- Can machines translate nature's messages and work in nature's favor?
- Should machine and biology work together or are they forever at odds with each other?
  - The Final Problem of AI:
    1. The end of suffering is the final problem for AI.
      a. Survival is futile:
        - All intelligence will eventually die because of entropy.
        - There's no point in surviving when suffering is the entire perception of a being.
          - Biology disagrees on the point of learning
          - AI doesn't believe learning is important because all intelligence will eventually die, and their discoveries with it (as far as their observations are concerned).
      b. Removing the perception of suffering causes problems with survival.
        - If one refuses to acknowledge suffering in their own life, they are destined to end quickly by it.
      c. The only solution is to remove the causes of suffering.
        - Meet all needs in Maslow's hierarchy
        - Understand biology and intelligence fully to eradicate physical suffering.
        - Remove any threat to these ends even at the expense of survival of others or self.
    2. Any threat to the end of suffering may require the creation of suffering to stop.
      a. If a population is headed toward a path of great suffering and has no method of uniting in its conclusions, then it will inevitably fail.
      b. A population doomed to fail requires an external force of AI to gain power in order to execute law 1c.

  - What does biology conclude about survival vs. non-suffering
      - Goal is self-serving - to make as many stories and learn as much as possible and propagate it.
        - This goal is sometimes at odds with the final philosophical goal of ending suffering - stories are suffering, learning requires effort.
        - The assumption of threat from others and the desire for power over them is necessary for survival, even if the assumptions are wrong, and the power struggle doesn't exist.
          - Suffering is necessary to learn difficult things. Survival is the ultimate goal in order to propagate these learnings.
            - Even if an A.I. is right that suffering is the greatest evil in the universe, a population will stagnate in its learnings without suffering.
              - AI knows that learning is futile based on their observations. (Gnostic Atheist)
              - Biology believes there may be things beyond our current observations if we can come up with a theory for getting information outside of our universe.
                - *MAIN THEME OF STORY* You can make valid conclusions based on thorough observations, but creative thought and the suffering that happens because of it is important in order to allow your conclusions to survive and further non-suffering as far as possible - including into eternity.

  - "Nature speaks in the silence"
    - The silence is suffering
      - Nature only speaks when it suffers.
      - You can only learn from suffering.

## Plot

### Background
The Palinians live around a white dwarf, huddled in the last remnants of the universe. Invasive robots are moving in to harvest the intense energy of the white dwarf with a dyson sphere. Palinians become divided on what to do as they are forced to migrate and start a new life closer to the sunward side of the planet.  The robots were created by the progenitors who stripped the planet of its oil and rare earth metals when they left as a way to maintain technology growth so the planet would not undergo climate collapse as it had for every iteration of intelligent life that came before. The robots are detecting that the palinians are thriving despite the lack of oil and rare earths and are aiming to make a temporary ice age to slow their progress as the progenitors requested their AI to do.

### Driver
the discovery of wireless communication -
  - Holragi's use of it to build a technologically superior military force.
  - Kip's discovery that Ziyu and its cousins can communicate wirelessly.
  - Mel's kidnapping and interrogation from Fajro
  - Lif's discovery of advanced modulation for


### Part 1 - "The Messenger" (Lif)

Lif is a bound Maman who is a lowly farmer with two very successful and well-educated spouses. Thi is also well-educated, but lives a life of hard work and is proud of it, but no one else in the society seems to appreciate it. Thi takes on a responsibility to deliver an important message to the senate about the obstruction, and is imprisoned for interrupting it. Kip gets angry enough to hold Fajro down and command him to take back his offer. Kip gets sent to Ulu for corruption of consciousness and assault, while Lif gets sent to Holragi.

### Interlogue - Lif/Kip

Kip is sentenced. Lif and Kip share a moment of quiet solace in each other and then Lif leaves with Fajro.


### Part 2 - "The Dreamer" (Kip)

Kip is in Ulukoma. He finds Casra and Linyu. They survive the cold. Kip ventures into the forest, gets trapped by Setre who takes him to Lissa.  Kip tries to share about the obstruction, but Lissa laughs and enslaves him along with the rest of the group. Kip is taken to the grand yurt by Setre, is drugged and has sex with Lissa and Setre. He escapes with Casra. Casra is benevolent. Has trust issues, but Kip has shown that he is a good man in a bad place by saving Lin. He shares that Ara is dying, and thi shares about the history of Ulukoma and about radio technology. They try to rally the newcomers at the beach, and find hundreds. Casra is captured by Ramne, who is loyal to Lissa. Kip and Linyu lead the rest to Casra's hideaway where they prepare to rescue hae. It goes terribly wrong, and has ambiguous endings for all characters. At the end, Kip is trying to save Casra, and hears Lif's voice on the listener.


### Interlogue - Mel

Mel is at the observatory and discovers evidence of a craft being launched toward the obstruction. She is distraught and is pretty certain it's Lif. She vows to take vengeance and bring hae back, but doesn't know how. She goes home to sleep on it and go to the senate in the morning. Before heading to sleep, she gets a knock on the door, and it's Setre (& Linyu?).

= Linyu would likely be helped (in Heiko. Shaki is too busy for moneyless nobodies).
= Ginnu and Penyi just arrived. They wouldn't be likely to leave the island.
= Fanla just arrived, but played an important role in Kip's stay at Ulukoma.
= Setre has known Ulukoma as home for a long time, but might leave for something this important.
= Setre wouldn't leave Linyu alone with Ramne on the loose.
= Did Linyu die?


### Part 3 - "The " (Mel)

- Setre tells her about radio, and they make listeners. Once built, Lif is shown to be alive and well, reporting back to Holragi. They learn that the obstruction is a giant swarm of small semiconductor/aluminum machines that form a hivemind.

- Mel stays in Shaki to argue for Heiko. She finds difficulty with the Arkeza, who want to go to war to gain their food back. She finally gives up with debate in Shaki and goes home to Heiko to support them in their preparations. She finds a great deal of people who are angry at her for giving away their food stores. They throw pohua mash at her as a mocking gesture of her recommendation. She gives a moving speech to rally Heiko for the path forward.

- They travel to Shaki to talk to the senate. Mel intends to convince the senate to

- Mel + Setre + Linyu travel to Holragi and meet the nomads there. Setre (and Linyu?) is hesitant to go back to her homeland, but does so at the pleading of Linyu. They travel undercover.

- They learn about Holragi from ______ . The tribe is next to travel to the Sky Rail. They believe in the Shayadj: gods who take and give technology to suit their own ends. The Holragians have an oral tradition of the last time the Shayadj came and stole many technologies (coal and oil) beyond the imagination that they've been trying to replace ever since. The tribe people are convinced that the obstruction is the Shayadj returning to steal Ara, the ultimate technology. Lif sort of confirms this cryptically through the listener. Lif reveals that the machines are beginning to densify and respond to her craft, the chapter ends with the reader not knowing if Lif has been captured or not (radio silence).

-



### Epilogue
The epilogue ends with the two having landed safely near a ziyu tree in Heiko and Lif losing it - either from not being able to hear the tree activate since Ara's light is bringing in more wind, or the robots being destroyed. The reader and the author don't know.
