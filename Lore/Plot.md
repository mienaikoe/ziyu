# Character Arcs

## Lif

Has a major arc where she goes from self-reliant and afraid to heroic and vulnerable to her family, but thi maintains chaotic good throughout the story. Thi has constant imposter syndrome about hae own life. Lif is chaotic good and supports the pride party that wants to do stop the robots.

## Mel

Is a lawful neutral character that believes in Lif's purpose, but isn't in a position to make decisions from a non-consensus standpoint. She does not have a major arc, but remains true to her promises to her family and her nation, even if she has to keep secrets from both of them sometimes to maintain order. Mel supports the Arkeza as she wants her family to survive the robotic culling that seems inevitable.

## Kip

Is a character that starts out bored with life and becomes obsessed with sense of duty and heroism, to a fault. Kip does not take ideological sides and is generally seen as a


# Main Plot Point

Option A)
  The Palinians live around a white dwarf, huddled in the last remnants of the universe. Invasive robots are moving in to harvest the intense energy of the white dwarf. Palinians become divided on what to do as they are forced to migrate and start a new life closer to the sunward side of the planet.

Option B)
  By the end, reveal that the robots were created by the progenitors of the Palinians. They invented three sexes and hid all oil and rare earth metals as a way to maintain population growth so the planet could remain in equilibrium with the species. The ring is an ancient orbiting station and giant antenna for prepping for space travel from the surface. An AI on the ring is detecting that the Palinians are becoming too technologically advanced and are aiming to make an ice age to set them back a bit. Sequels might feature battles where the AI's robots are attempting to invade to complete their goals.

  Theme: The tragedy of the commons is or is not inevitable, and the debate around that.

  Some archaeological zealots (the Arkeza party) believe the word of the progenitors as if it were law, and believe the tragedy of the commons is the inevitable, natural law and they wish to withold the truth so they can control the stability of the population and gain power. These are pure rationalists that abide by historical evidence only. They believe there is very little difference between progenitors and Palinians, that corruption and consumption are a constant in their society and that it requires occasional culling to sustain it. Mel is secretly one of these but changes course at the end, turning on her arkeza allies.

  Kip abstains from the debate and simply wishes to perform his duties of healing.

  Lif wants to stop the robots by launching from the ring to L1, where the shrouds are, and destabilizing them with an EMP . She falls in line with psychologists and futurists (the Palin-idji "Palinian Pride" party) that believe the progenitors had a flawed society that caused them to fall. The pride party believes people are naturally socially generous and rewards social behavior instead of individual behavior. They proactively reward much more than reactively punishing. They believe that their society and physiology is flawed, but is not corrupt and lame the way the progenitors were. They believe three sexes and maintaining a tradition of science will curb the instability of population boom and resource consumption. They believe that it was the fault of the progenitors' two sexes and corrupt government that led them to have a population boom and a society that couldn't move quickly enough to keep consumption in check.
