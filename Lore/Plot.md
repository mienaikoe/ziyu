# Main Plot Point

There is a large robotic construction effort happening at L1 of Palinan's orbit. At first, the Palinians believe that some alien species are trying to kill the sentient life on the planet by forcing an ice age, but when they send research missions, they realize the entire structure is built by robots who are trying to shield the planet from:

option 1) the radiation and shock wave of their binary stars creating a nova. This, in an effort to preserve the life on the planet. The robots are of mysterious origin.

option 2) A large solar flare [unpredictable]

option 3) Helium Flash from Ara

option 4) A large incoming asteroid (can be from anywhere)
