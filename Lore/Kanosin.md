# Kanosin

Kanosin is a compound that forms a pseduo-symbiotic relationship with its user. It's often used for its psychoactive and light effects. Acute use causes nightvision and light aversion. Chronic use can cause complete blindness.

The guardians of Ulukoma inject a small amount of kanosin into their blood during times of battle so they can see in the darkness and are not fearful. Kanosin can also be injected in the hydroderm for its light effects without any of the psychoactive or nightvision effects.

A rarely-known effect of Kanosin is its ability to delay cell-death and promote cell repair. In most beings, this would be highly carcinogenic, but Throngia and other light-exposed animals on Palinan have innate cancer-prevention because of the nature of their white dwarf star Ara. There's a possibility that rapid cell repair is the root cause of the psychoactive effects (many thoughts at once) but it is not fully understood.

# Kanonites

Kanosin is made by Kanonites. If Kanonites get into your blood, they will put your body into stasis, and scramble your brain so that you remain asleep without a heartbeat, and warm you so you remain alive. They will remain there until an EMP causes them to restart your body and the kanonites die. For Ginnu/Annu, this EMP was caused by a table.
