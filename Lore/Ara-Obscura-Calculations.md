# Ara / Obscura Calculation

Calculations of the time it takes for the obscura to heat Ara enough for its photons to have enough momentum to push against the sails of Ara

## Cp

white dwarfs are carbon and oxygen'

O2 = 32e-3 kg/mol, 30 J/mol K
C = 12e-3 kg/mol, 10 J/mol K

50/50 mix =
(30 / 32e-3) J/kg-K O2
(10 / 12e-3) J/kg-K C
/ 2
= about 1000 J/kg-K

1000 J/kg-K

Helium atmosphere, 1% of total mass

## m

0.15 -> 1.2

Average, 0.55 Solar Masses

This white dwarf should be on the smaller end because it has to live a while

0.5 solar masses, 1.9891e31 kg / 2

1e31 kg

1e29 kg helium

## T

30e3 -> 5e3 K

Sirius B, 0.12 BYa, 25e3 Kelvin, 1 solar mass

This is an older white dwarf because it has intelligent life on it that wasn't seeded.

lean heavier to the cooler ones, because
"This trend stops when we reach extremely cool white dwarfs; few white dwarfs are observed with surface temperatures below 4,000 K,[65] and one of the coolest so far observed, WD 0346+246, has a surface temperature of approximately 3,900 K.[56] The reason for this is that the Universe's age is finite;[66][67] there has not been enough time for white dwarfs to cool below this temperature."

4000 Kelvin

## P

3.8e24 Watts

## Time

Assuming constant heating of helium outer layer, and none of the inner Oxygen/Carbon layer

```
P/(m*Cp) = dT/dt

(3.8e24) / (1e31 \* 1000) = 3.8e-8 K/s

1.1950848 K / year

```
