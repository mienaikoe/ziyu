### Provinces

**Heiko Province** 
a province on the Western coast. This is where the story begins. 
Heiko province is the agricultural and forestry center of the whole planet. Heiko is a more anarchic democratic society. There is very little sense of imbalance or crime amongst the people, so there is not a need for centralized government or  As a society, they haven't grown much in a century. There is no military threat, so they have no defenses. However, if attacked it is assumed they could defend themselves fairly well, as they are taught martial arts in childhood and they have a strong sense of pride for their province. 

Heikoans live comfortably in temperature fluctuations and do well for themselves in outdoor environments. Heikoans live happily with the amount of technology they feel they need. They don't feel the need to use economic tools like investing. They instead, choose to give their efforts and products to people they see as worthy. This includes supplying food to the capital for their machines and technical know-how. Heiko's education system is pretty good when it comes to classics, but doesn't cover technologies such as semiconductors, large- or small-scale engineering, or non-classical physics.

**Shaki Province** 

Shaki is the capital, and the province of the same name is the "Greater" area around it. Shakians are well-educated and a little snobbish about it. They've learned to automate a great deal of the jobs they don't want to do themselves, but retain culture by not automating the jobs that still carry a great amount of creativity and ingenuity such as art, music, cooking, design, science, and engineering. They have harnessed renewable energy, population control, and education in a way that allows them to live luxurious lives. However, they still rely on materials and people from the other provinces and sometimes forget this fact. There is order in this province, with a clear hiearchy of government.

**Lun'u Province**

Lun'u is located inland - close to the deserts and mountains in the South. Lun'u is mostly a mining province, but they also produce some milled grains that can only be found in the mountains. The government of Lun'u is hierarchical, but not nearly as much as Shaki's government. Lun'u is divided into 96 precincts, each of which are self-governed. Each precinct handles its own dealings with other precincts and with the Shaki and Heiko.

The science and culture of the Lun'u is based on tradition and proof. Whatever happened and worked for a great number of people a hundred years ago would still apply today. If it can be proven through close observation of several people that a thing is harmful, then the research is scrutinized, and if approved, widely accepted by a precinct. Most precincts are quick to adopt the findings of another precinct quickly after it's approved by one.

**Halpa Province** 

A province on the Northwestern coast made of a tribal people that use only simple technology. Each person, man, woman, or nyman is trained to be a warrior as children. The tribal customs are law for Halpians. Defying it is a personal conflict and most Halpians believe the person would defy it for a reason, and do not ask or judge what the reason is. The tribes are generational, being created solely for small groups of adults to mate and raise children. The children will journey to find another group when they are of age. There is no idea of a single spouse for a lifetime. The tribe senses a strong friendship and sexual bond amongst all its members. 


## The Black Crown (Heigi)

There are about 5 shell colonies (known as Gems). Each shell is self-sustaining and elliptical - Most people living in a ring valley. The "higher" parts of the ellipse are to keep the atmosphere inside, provide a very strong, lightsource, and provide surface area for solar and cosmic energy capture. The shells are made of asteroidic iron formed into a steel. The outer parts are coated with a semiconductor film that captures energy to be used in the central light source. There are large sapphire windows at ground-level that help with crop-growing.

The colonies appear to have been used previously by an advanced diploid species from Palinan, but records of them have long since been lost. There are expedition crews that visit the gems regularly to look for clues, but they can't be there for more than 10 days because of food and water supply. There are ideas that the gems can be reseeded and re-used as colonies, but the plans for that lie far in the future.
