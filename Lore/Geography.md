### Provinces
- **Heiko Province** 
a province on the Western coast. This is where the story begins. 
Heiko province is the agricultural and forestry center of the whole planet. Heiko is a more anarchic democratic society. There is very little sense of imbalance or crime amongst the people, so there is not a need for centralized government or  As a society, they haven't grown much in a century. There is no military threat, so they have no defenses. However, if attacked it is assumed they could defend themselves fairly well, as they are taught martial arts in childhood and they have a strong sense of pride for their province. 


They live comfortably in temperature fluctuations and do well for themselves in outdoor environments. Heikoans live happily with the amount of technology they feel they need. They don't feel the need to use economic tools like investing. They instead, choose to give their efforts and products to people they see as worthy. This includes supplying food to the capital for their machines and technical know-how. Heiko's education system is pretty good when it comes to classics, but naturally doesn't cover more modern technologies such as semiconductors.



They have harnessed renewable energy, population control, and education in a way that allows them to live luxurious lives. There is order in this province, with a clear hiearchy of government but enough technology that they live comfortably.
