## Palinan

- A planet about 0.8x the diameter of Earth.
- Palinan's orbital period is about 5 Earth days.
- There is one continental land mass and one big ocean. The planet is 65% ocean.
- There is a big desert at the middle of the land mass. It faces the star. Most Palinians live on the Coastal Ring.
- There is tectonic action and a magnetic field due to tidal forces. This also gives rise to large mountains on the bright side and splotched islands amidst a vast sea on the dark side.
- Winds at the surface flow from the cold side to the warm side

## Solar System

Palinan is an earth-sized tidally locked planet with an elliptical orbit around a white dwarf.
Ara is the white dwarf. They also use this term to refer to the bright half of the sky.
The Palinians call the dark direction of the sky Ulu. They use these for cardinal directions as well.
the solar horizon is marked by the Black Crown. A large ring of black debris from a calamity that happened millions of years ago. (Protection of the planet from the impending planetary nebula)

## Time

Since Palinan is a tidal-locked planet, there is no passage of day or night. Palinan follows a slight elliptical path with its star, which defines a day by the amount of light arriving at the horizon areas, and also gives rise to some tectonic action and volcanism. There is a slight libration that causes some parts to receive slightly more light at different times of the day. Those who have a more direct line of light from the star during periapsis also have a less direct line of light from the star during apoapsis, meaning they have greater temperature shifts during their day.

Everything greather than a day is measured in whole integers or approximations thereof. The population is taught early to understand the magnitude of integers in their base 12 system. This is akin to Japan, where currency is measured in thousands and tens of thousands regularly. Decimals are a different story: when using them so often to delineate meeting times, train times, work times, it is more appropriate to use `day x 12^-4` as the common unit: a tick. This allows us to use:

1 tick = ~15 earth seconds
12 ticks = ~3 earth minutes
144 ticks (hundred ticks for translation short) = ~35 earth minutes
1728 ticks (thousand for translation short) = ~7 earth hours
1 day is 20736 ticks

There is a particle for the grades of scale. `X na Y` literally means `X*10^Y`, so `3 na 5` can be seen as an approximation of 300,000. This book will tend not to using this particule literally unless quoted for scientific or economic specificity.

Eras are measured by volcanic activity that makes the whole world go dark and cold for a temporary time. The Throngia have a limited understanding for why this happens but know that it happens somewhat regularly through time in approximately 100,000 day increments. The story takes place in the days after the seventh cold.

## Distance

Distance is measured in ratios of circumference of the planet. Like time, the more practical measurement is in paces.

- 1 Pace = ~2.6 feet
- 12 Paces = ~31 feet, roughly 5 people height
- 144 Paces (hundred ticks for translation short) = ~380 feet, roughly a football field
- 1,728 paces (thousand for translation short) = ~0.86 miles, roughly a mile
- 20,736 paces (ten-thousand for translation short) = ~10 miles, roughly manhattan -> flushing
- 248,832 paces (shortened with an actual number) = ~125 miles, roughly cleveland -> columbus
- 2,985,984 paces (shortened with an actual number) = ~1500 miles, roughly miami -> new york
- 35,831,808 paces (shortened with an actual number) = ~17,644 miles, roughly the avg circum of mars and earth = 1 Arc/Circumference of Palinan

## Dimension

Palinan has a different division of measurements for Distance and Dimension because of different uses for each. Dimension is a highly technical term that came from the metallurgists and engineers from the west (Shaki, Holragi, Seroa, Chista).

- 1 Ki = A standard of measurement that's approximately 0.458 millimeters. There is very little need for dimensions smaller than this, as machining isn't precise enough (1 ki is about 18 thou). If it does, scientists will use negative numbers, as in `X na -1`.
- 144 ki = ~2.5 inches
- 1728 ki = 1 pace

12 cubic Ki of pure iron is a recently standardized unit of weight.

## Urban Planning

Cities and living areas are typically formed near the sea, and the remaining area at the habitable line is typically farmland where there are solar-facing hills, and residences of those nearby areas. There are solar-thermal power stations at the solar-facing edge of the habitable line and near cities. Trains typically travel from power station to power station across the habitable line. Most food storage is in the dark edge of the habitable line.

### Provinces

**Heiko Province**
A province on the southeast coast. This is where the story begins.
Heiko province is the agricultural and forestry center of the whole planet. Heiko is a more democratic communist society. There is very little sense of imbalance or crime amongst the people, so there is not a need for centralized government or As a society, they haven't grown much in a century. There is no military threat, so they have little in the way of defenses. However, if attacked it is assumed they could defend themselves fairly well, as they have a very ordered way of conveying information and organizing the public. They also are pretty good at physics as they have the best observatory in the land.

Heikoans live comfortably in temperature fluctuations and do well for themselves in outdoor environments. Heikoans live happily with the amount of technology they feel they need. They don't feel the need to use economic tools like investing. They instead, choose to give their efforts and products to people they see as worthy. This includes supplying food to the capital for their machines and technical know-how. Heiko's education system is pretty good when it comes to classical studies such as math, science, philosophy, but doesn't cover practical ideas like engineering and economics as much.

**Rudjan Province**
A province North of Heiko. Rudjan is a giant archipelago/tributary, the center of which is a city build on islands, peninsulae and piers. Rudjan's biggest export is fish, sea vegetables, and boats. Rudjan relies heavily on Holrag for steel which it uses to create ships, armaments, rails, and tools. Rudjan often acts as an economic broker, as it built and maintained all of the naval energy outposts that travel cross-wind between cities, which are vital to the infrastructure of trade. Rudjan has a major focus on water sports, with its main sport being a circuitous paddle race around and/or through the islands of rudjan in a boat of 12 paddlers and steerers.

Rudjan stole the land it settled on from Saffa, which attacked back with guerilla tactics, as they were fairly intelligent. The two brokered a deal to leave each other alone as long as the Pangum of Rudjan didn't expand past a certain point, which it largely kept. The peace deal is well-known for being negotiated by using large logs that marked the islands that would make up the border, and moving them one-by-one until they were both happy. The positions of the historic logs are now marked with large rocks that require the help of both Saffa and Pangum. It is the first and last treaty made without conventional language.

**Yansha Province**
A province on the outskirts of Shaki. Acts as a sort of suburb, including second homes for the elite of Shaki, small gardens and restaurants to feed those people finer foods, and lots of shady business to go around. Lots of cultural items come out of Yansha as well, if the elites decide to like it. Stories and artworks that make it here are sent to Shaki for mass production, or are doomed to fail. Other provinces often send their best here to gain influence if sent to Shaki.

**Shaki Province**
Shaki is the capital, and the province of the same name is the "Greater" area around it. Shaki sits at the northern magnetic pole of Palinan. Shakians are well-educated and a little snobbish about it. They've led the way into the industrial revolution, harnessing solar thermal energy, power cycles, and chemistry in a way that allows them to live luxurious lives. However, they still rely on materials and people from the other provinces and sometimes forget this fact. There is democracy and capitalism in this province, with a clear hiearchy of government. They permit Heikoans small purchases like meals and travel free of charge and bill it back to the Heiko government which pays its debts from the income of its foodstuffs.

It is the seat of the Senate of Palinan, which is a seat of deliberation over issues that might send the entire planet into war, or might wipe one of them off the planet. The senate also decides laws for the entire planet, but naturally, these laws need to be unanimously passed. The only law that has been passed is the rights of consciousness, which forms a sort of religion amongst many in the world.

**Holrag Republic**
Holrag is located slightly inland, upon the steppes close to the central desert and the Shaki/Seroa foothills. Holrag is mostly a mining and industry province, but they also produce some wild milled grains that can only be found on the steppe. The government of Holrag is hierarchical, but not nearly as much as Shaki's government. Holrag is divided into 96 nomadic clans, each of which are self-governed. Each clan shares in the labor and the wealth of the land. Installations such as farms and mines and engineering projects are locations where the clans travel to and from on their circular journey.

The science and culture of the Holrag is based on tradition and proof. Whatever happened and worked for a great number of people a hundred years ago would still apply today. If an idea can be proven through close observation of several people then the research is scrutinized, and if approved, widely accepted by the clan. Most precincts are quick to adopt the findings of another clan after it's approved by one.

**Ulukoma**
Ulukoma is an anarchic prison island for Shaki, on an island in the darkness of Ulu, several miles Ulu-ward of Shaki Harbor. The island is covered with trees, and has largely gone unexplored because of its colder lands. It does, however, have food sources that seem to grow in the dark such as fish and kelp.

The Shadestead is a small village in the centerof the island, ruled by agression by Lissa, a sociopathic and paranoid maman who will stop at nothing to humiliate, addict, or kill those who speak or act against hae. The only law in the Shadestead is the judgment of the people. This prevents things like serial killers, but framing and blackmail and conspiracy become easy. There is generally no binding here, and people have open sexual and romantic relationships with the entire population. Some long-time residents are proud of the makeshift civilization they made, and refuse to go back.

Of interesting note is the bluekelp which grows abundantly in the waters near and dark of Ulukoma. The bluekelp contains a bacteria that maintains mitochondria, including after death, so that the person heals and may restart breathing and can never actually die as long as they have the bacteria in their blood. The bacteria grew this to sustain the life of their hosts, which were historically fish and sea mammals, but Pangum are included in this as well.

**Other Provinces that aren't settings in the book**
**_Chista Province_**
A small province in the various Ara-open valley between Shaki and Seroa. They control the Shaki foothills that lie neareset to Ara. During the Holragi invasions, they decided to stay and rebuild instead of fleeing to the mountains, like the Seroans.

Their main feature is that they control the railroad between Shaki and Holrag. The province may be small but this tactical position has allowed them to have a strong economy, and to build robust political defenses. No province would dare destroy the city of passage, because every province relies on Holragi for steel, and Holragi relies on their food.

**_Seroa Province_**
A colder mountain province on the far side of Shaki, sharing the same ridge system. Much like Rudjan, its many cities are walled, but the walls do not cover the road system, as they preferred to be well-defended than convenient. Seroa didn't even allow the rail system in its lands, much to the chagrin of Holrag, so the rail system passes through the Chista instead. It's a rather insular place because of a long history of Holragi invasion for which the Shaki'i did not help them.

The number of cities reflects its desire to remain flexible and ready for attack at any time. If one city were to fall under seige, the others would know quickly and rally a response.

Seroa's main export is stone and roast kelp.

**_Bay of Dala'a_**
Not really a province, but big enough to be one. A large body of water that divides the vast Holragi steppe and Heiko. Probably an asteroid impact from a long time ago.

<!--
A province on the Northwestern coast made of a tribal people that use only simple technology. Each person, man, woman, or nyman is trained to be a warrior as children. The tribal customs are law for Halpians. Defying it is a personal conflict and most Halpians believe the person would defy it for a reason, and do not ask or judge what the reason is. The tribes are generational, being created solely for small groups of adults to mate and raise children. The children will journey to find another group when they are of age. There is no idea of a single spouse for a lifetime. The tribe senses a strong friendship and sexual bond amongst all its members.

## The Black Crown? (Heigi)

There are about 5 shell colonies (known as Gems). Each shell is self-sustaining and elliptical - Most people living in a ring valley. The "higher" parts of the ellipse are to keep the atmosphere inside, provide a very strong, lightsource, and provide surface area for solar and cosmic energy capture. The shells are made of asteroidic iron formed into a steel. The outer parts are coated with a semiconductor film that captures energy to be used in the central light source. There are large sapphire windows at ground-level that help with crop-growing.

The colonies appear to have been used previously by an advanced diploid species from Palinan, but records of them have long since been lost. There are expedition crews that visit the gems regularly to look for clues, but they can't be there for more than 10 days because of food and water supply. There are ideas that the gems can be reseeded and re-used as colonies, but the plans for that lie far in the future.
