## Palinan
- A planet about 1.3x larger than Earth.
- Palinan's orbital period is about 5 Earth days.
- There is one continental land mass and one big ocean. The planet is 65% ocean.
- There is a big desert at the middle of the land mass. It faces the star. Most Palinians live on the Coastal Ring.
- There is a ring of iron shell colonies and asteroids orbiting Palinan called the Black Crown.
- There is tectonic action and a magnetic field due to tidal forces. This also gives rise to large mountains on the bright side and splotched islands amidst a vast sea on the dark side.
- Winds at the surface flow from the cold side to the warm side



## Solar System

Palinan is an earth-sized tidally locked planet with an elliptical orbit around a white dwarf.
Ara is the white dwarf. They also use this term to refer to the bright half of the sky.
The Palinians call the dark direction of the sky Ulu. They use these for cardinal directions as well.
the solar horizon is marked by the Black Crown. A large ring of black debris from a calamity that happened millions of years ago. (Protection of the planet from the impending planetary nebula)


## Time

Since Palinan is a tidal-locked planet, there is no passage of day or night. Palinan follows a slight elliptical path with its star, which defines a day by the amount of light arriving at the horizon areas, and also gives rise to some tectonic action and volcanism. There is a slight libration that causes some parts to receive slightly more light at different times of the day. Those who have a more direct line of light from the star during periapsis also have a less direct line of light from the star during apoapsis, meaning they have greater temperature shifts during their day.
There are names for the various time divisions, which are tabulated here:

Nattova    12 Latovas    144 days
Lattova    12 Tovas      12 days
Tova/Day    .           1 day (~72 earth hours, ~3 earth days)
Va'ala   1/12 Tova    ~6 earth hours
Va'ama   1/12 Tova-La  ~30 minutes
Va'aka   1/12 Tova-Na  ~2.5 minutes
Va'asa   1/12 Tova-Ra  ~12.5 seconds



## Urban Planning

Cities and living areas are typically formed near the sea, and the remaining area at the habitable line is typically farmland where there are solar-facing hills, and residences of those nearby areas. There are solar-thermal power stations at the solar-facing edge of the habitable line and near cities. Trains typically travel from power station to power station across the habitable line. Most food storage is in the dark edge of the habitable line.



### Provinces

**Heiko Province**
a province on the Western coast. This is where the story begins.
Heiko province is the agricultural and forestry center of the whole planet. Heiko is a more anarchic democratic society. There is very little sense of imbalance or crime amongst the people, so there is not a need for centralized government or  As a society, they haven't grown much in a century. There is no military threat, so they have no defenses. However, if attacked it is assumed they could defend themselves fairly well, as they are taught martial arts in childhood and they have a strong sense of pride for their province.

Heikoans live comfortably in temperature fluctuations and do well for themselves in outdoor environments. Heikoans live happily with the amount of technology they feel they need. They don't feel the need to use economic tools like investing. They instead, choose to give their efforts and products to people they see as worthy. This includes supplying food to the capital for their machines and technical know-how. Heiko's education system is pretty good when it comes to classics, but doesn't cover technologies such as semiconductors, large- or small-scale engineering, or non-classical physics.

**Shaki Province**

Shaki is the capital, and the province of the same name is the "Greater" area around it. Shakians are well-educated and a little snobbish about it. They've learned to automate a great deal of the jobs they don't want to do themselves, but retain culture by not automating the jobs that still carry a great amount of creativity and ingenuity such as art, music, cooking, design, science, and engineering. They have harnessed renewable energy, population control, and education in a way that allows them to live luxurious lives. However, they still rely on materials and people from the other provinces and sometimes forget this fact. There is order in this province, with a clear hiearchy of government.

**Lun'u Province**

Lun'u is located inland - close to the deserts and mountains in the South. Lun'u is mostly a mining province, but they also produce some milled grains that can only be found in the mountains. The government of Lun'u is hierarchical, but not nearly as much as Shaki's government. Lun'u is divided into 96 precincts, each of which are self-governed. Each precinct handles its own dealings with other precincts and with the Shaki and Heiko.

The science and culture of the Lun'u is based on tradition and proof. Whatever happened and worked for a great number of people a hundred years ago would still apply today. If it can be proven through close observation of several people that a thing is harmful, then the research is scrutinized, and if approved, widely accepted by a precinct. Most precincts are quick to adopt the findings of another precinct quickly after it's approved by one.

**Halpa Province**

A province on the Northwestern coast made of a tribal people that use only simple technology. Each person, man, woman, or nyman is trained to be a warrior as children. The tribal customs are law for Halpians. Defying it is a personal conflict and most Halpians believe the person would defy it for a reason, and do not ask or judge what the reason is. The tribes are generational, being created solely for small groups of adults to mate and raise children. The children will journey to find another group when they are of age. There is no idea of a single spouse for a lifetime. The tribe senses a strong friendship and sexual bond amongst all its members.



## The Black Crown (Heigi)

There are about 5 shell colonies (known as Gems). Each shell is self-sustaining and elliptical - Most people living in a ring valley. The "higher" parts of the ellipse are to keep the atmosphere inside, provide a very strong, lightsource, and provide surface area for solar and cosmic energy capture. The shells are made of asteroidic iron formed into a steel. The outer parts are coated with a semiconductor film that captures energy to be used in the central light source. There are large sapphire windows at ground-level that help with crop-growing.

The colonies appear to have been used previously by an advanced diploid species from Palinan, but records of them have long since been lost. There are expedition crews that visit the gems regularly to look for clues, but they can't be there for more than 10 days because of food and water supply. There are ideas that the gems can be reseeded and re-used as colonies, but the plans for that lie far in the future.
