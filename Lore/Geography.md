## Palinan
- A planet about 1.3x larger than Earth.
- Palinan's orbital period is about 5 Earth days.
- There is one continental land mass and one big ocean. The planet is 65% ocean.
- There is a big desert at the middle of the land mass. It faces the star. Most Palinians live on the Coastal Ring.
- There is a ring of iron shell colonies and asteroids orbiting Palinan called the Black Crown.
- There is tectonic action and a magnetic field due to tidal forces. This also gives rise to large mountains on the bright side and splotched islands amidst a vast sea on the dark side.
- Winds at the surface flow from the cold side to the warm side



## Solar System

Palinan is an earth-sized tidally locked planet with an elliptical orbit around a white dwarf.
Ara is the white dwarf. They also use this term to refer to the bright half of the sky.
The Palinians call the dark direction of the sky Ulu. They use these for cardinal directions as well.
the solar horizon is marked by the Black Crown. A large ring of black debris from a calamity that happened millions of years ago. (Protection of the planet from the impending planetary nebula)


## Time

Since Palinan is a tidal-locked planet, there is no passage of day or night. Palinan follows a slight elliptical path with its star, which defines a day by the amount of light arriving at the horizon areas, and also gives rise to some tectonic action and volcanism. There is a slight libration that causes some parts to receive slightly more light at different times of the day. Those who have a more direct line of light from the star during periapsis also have a less direct line of light from the star during apoapsis, meaning they have greater temperature shifts during their day.
There are names for the various time divisions, which are tabulated here:

Sa'To(va)   12 Ka'to      ~170.4 Earth years
Ka'To(va)   12 Na'to      ~14.2 Earth years
Na'To(va)   12 La'to      ~1.18 Earth years
La'To(va)   12 Tova       ~36 Earth days
Tova/Day    1 orbit       ~3 earth days
(To)Va'la   1/12 Tova     ~6 earth hours
(To)Va'na   1/12 Va'la    ~30 minutes
(To)Va'ka   1/12 Va'na    ~2.5 minutes
(To)Va'sa   1/12 Va'ka    ~12.5 seconds

This also means La'X means 12x something; akin to "ten" "hundred" "thousand".
X'la means something divided into 12; akin to "tenth", "hundredth", "thousandth".




## Urban Planning

Cities and living areas are typically formed near the sea, and the remaining area at the habitable line is typically farmland where there are solar-facing hills, and residences of those nearby areas. There are solar-thermal power stations at the solar-facing edge of the habitable line and near cities. Trains typically travel from power station to power station across the habitable line. Most food storage is in the dark edge of the habitable line.



### Provinces

**Heiko Province**
a province on the Western coast. This is where the story begins.
Heiko province is the agricultural and forestry center of the whole planet. Heiko is a more democratic communist society. There is very little sense of imbalance or crime amongst the people, so there is not a need for centralized government or  As a society, they haven't grown much in a century. There is no military threat, so they have little in the way of defenses. However, if attacked it is assumed they could defend themselves fairly well, as they have a very ordered way of conveying information and organizing the public. They also are pretty good at physics as they have the best observatory in the land.

Heikoans live comfortably in temperature fluctuations and do well for themselves in outdoor environments. Heikoans live happily with the amount of technology they feel they need. They don't feel the need to use economic tools like investing. They instead, choose to give their efforts and products to people they see as worthy. This includes supplying food to the capital for their machines and technical know-how. Heiko's education system is pretty good when it comes to classical studies such as math, science, philosophy, but doesn't cover practical ideas like engineering and economics as much.

**Shaki Province**

Shaki is the capital, and the province of the same name is the "Greater" area around it. Shakians are well-educated and a little snobbish about it. They've led the way into the industrial revolution, harnessing solar thermal energy, power cycles, and chemistry in a way that allows them to live luxurious lives. However, they still rely on materials and people from the other provinces and sometimes forget this fact. There is democracy and capitalism in this province, with a clear hiearchy of government. They permit Heikoans small purchases like meals and travel free of charge and bill it back to the Heiko government which pays its debts in foodstuffs. It is the seat of the Senate of Palinan.


**Holragi Province**

Holragi is located slightly inland - close to the deserts and mountains in the West. Holragi is mostly a mining province, but they also produce some milled grains that can only be found in the mountains. The government of Holragi is hierarchical, but not nearly as much as Shaki's government. Holragi is divided into 96 nomadic clans, each of which are self-governed. Each clan shares in the labor and the wealth of the land. Installations such as farms and mines and engineering projects are locations where the clans travel to and from on their circular journey.

The science and culture of the Holragi is based on tradition and proof. Whatever happened and worked for a great number of people a hundred years ago would still apply today. If an idea can be proven through close observation of several people then the research is scrutinized, and if approved, widely accepted by the clan. Most precincts are quick to adopt the findings of another clan quickly after it's approved by one.


**The Shadestead on Ulukoma**

Ulukoma is an anarchic prison island for Shaki, on an island in the darkness of Ulu, several miles east of Shaki Harbor. The island is covered with trees, and has largely gone unexplored because of its colder lands. It does, however, have food sources that seem to grow in the dark such as fish and kelp.

The Shadestead is a small village in the centerof the island, ruled by agression by Lissa, a sociopathic and paranoid maman who will stop at nothing to humiliate, addict, or kill those who speak or act against hae. The only law in the Shadestead is the judgment of the people. This prevents things like serial killers, but framing and blackmail and conspiracy become easy. There is generally no binding here, and people have open sexual and romantic relationships with the entire population, often leading to unwanted pregnancies. Some long-time residents are proud of the makeshift civilization they made, and refuse to go back.

<!--
A province on the Northwestern coast made of a tribal people that use only simple technology. Each person, man, woman, or nyman is trained to be a warrior as children. The tribal customs are law for Halpians. Defying it is a personal conflict and most Halpians believe the person would defy it for a reason, and do not ask or judge what the reason is. The tribes are generational, being created solely for small groups of adults to mate and raise children. The children will journey to find another group when they are of age. There is no idea of a single spouse for a lifetime. The tribe senses a strong friendship and sexual bond amongst all its members.

## The Black Crown (Heigi)

There are about 5 shell colonies (known as Gems). Each shell is self-sustaining and elliptical - Most people living in a ring valley. The "higher" parts of the ellipse are to keep the atmosphere inside, provide a very strong, lightsource, and provide surface area for solar and cosmic energy capture. The shells are made of asteroidic iron formed into a steel. The outer parts are coated with a semiconductor film that captures energy to be used in the central light source. There are large sapphire windows at ground-level that help with crop-growing.

The colonies appear to have been used previously by an advanced diploid species from Palinan, but records of them have long since been lost. There are expedition crews that visit the gems regularly to look for clues, but they can't be there for more than 10 days because of food and water supply. There are ideas that the gems can be reseeded and re-used as colonies, but the plans for that lie far in the future.
