### Provinces
- **Heiko Province** 
a province on the Western coast. This is where the story begins. This province is the leading people of the whole moon. They have harnessed renewable energy, population control, and education in a way that allows them to live luxurious lives. There is order in this province, with a clear hiearchy of government but enough technology that they live comfortably. As a society, they haven't grown much in a century. There is no military threat, so they have no defenses.

- **Sha-Li Province** 
a province on the Eastern coast. These people live happily with a minimal amount of technology. They use mechanical machines, but can't afford electronic machines. Their education system is pretty good, but naturally doesn't cover things which the people don't know about. This society is a more anarchic democratic society. They don't have an organized defense system, but they value households defending themselves.

- **Halpa Province** 
a province on the Northern coast made of a tribal people that use only simple technology. Each person is trained to be a warrior.
