# The Biology of Pangum

## Sexes
	There are three sexes in some of the species on Pangum and Surien, including the humanoid species þrongia, although most species have two. In a three-sex species, one sex has eggs, while the other two have sperm. Gametes from all 3 are required for fertilization. Evolution has given rise to a long duration of fertility.
	
	- *Woman* - The third sex is more colloquially feminine than the other two. This sex is generally the most intelligent of the three and is often thinking about things at a large scale. I will use the terms "woman", "girl", "she", and "her" to describe this sex.
	
	- *Man* - Generally this sex is quieter in speech, and relies on physical strength to solve a problem. This sex generally has a stronger sense of spirituality and morality. I will use the terms "man", "boy", "he", "him", and "his" to refer to this sex.
	
	- *Ofan* - Although "female" is often defined as the sex that carries and delivers offspring, it would dishonor this sex to call them this. Therefore, I will use the terms "ofan", "kaln", "þe", and "þeir", which are the pangumian pronouns, to refer to this sex. In physical terms, this sex is typically flexible, endurant, and pain-tolerant, and more tomboyish in nature than a typical human woman. Þrongia Ofan are quick-thinking and are typically good at making split-second decisions.
	
	
## Life
	Like most animates, þrongia spend their first years learning, working, and forming friendships. Biologically, they begin developing into adults after about 20 Pangum years and continue until 30. Þrongia will often have two-member relationships when they begin puberty, and will form more stable three-member relationships toward the end of the phase as they begin to form families. At 20, most þrongia are able to choose their own paths of life and will work on whatever calls them and whatever their village or city needs. Some will stick with one duty for their whole lives, and others will jump duties with each month. They choose when they retire, oftentimes very late in life. They also choose when to die, typically together with their spouses.
