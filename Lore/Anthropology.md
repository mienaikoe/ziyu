## Sexes

There are three sexes in some of the species on Pangum and Surien, including the humanoid species þrongia, although most species have two. In a three-sex species, one sex has eggs, while the other two have sperm. Gametes from all 3 are required for fertilization. Evolution has given rise to a long duration of fertility.

- **Woman** - Having to bear offspring, this sex has wider hips and is taller than the other two. Woman is highly tolerant of physical and emotional pain. Woman is typically chosen as a leader of the family as they contribute the most genetic material to the offspring (50% via a two-chromesome egg). This is contentious to some in Pangum, where democracy is decided by families. Many believe that the future of Pangum is controlled by woman since a family's decision is made behind closed doors and posted by the leader of the family. I will use the terms "woman", "girl", "she", and "her" to describe this sex.

- **Man** - This sex is a carrier of his own gametes and those of the Ofan which form a two-chromesome sperm. Man is typically slower in movement but higher in dexterity. I will use the terms "man", "boy", "he", "him", and "his" to refer to this sex.

- **Ofan** - This sex has mammary glands that develop after woman releases pheremones during pregnancy. Although Earth females breastfeed, the physiological traits and instincts of the Ofan aren't quite matched to woman, so it would be inaccurate call the Ofan this. In physical terms, this sex typically has medium hips, low bmi, shorter stature and a faster pulse. Þrongia Ofan are quick-thinking and are typically good at making split-second decisions. The Ofan developed these traits to protect already-born offspring. Children are the closest to their Ofan parent, which I will call mother. I will use the terms "ofan", "kaln", "þe", and "þeir" to refer to this sex.



## Life

Like most animates, þrongia spend their first years learning, working, and forming friendships. Biologically, they begin developing into adults after about 20 Pangum years and continue until 30. Þrongia will often have two-member relationships when they begin puberty, and will form more stable three-member relationships toward the end of the phase as they begin to form families. At 20, most þrongia are able to choose their own paths of life and will work on whatever calls them and whatever their village or city needs. Some will stick with one duty for their whole lives, and others will jump duties with each month. They choose when they retire, oftentimes very late in life. They also choose when to die, typically together with their spouses.
