## Sexes

There are three sexes in some of the species on Pangum and Surien, including the humanoid species þrongia, although most species have two. In a three-sex species, one sex has eggs, while the other two have sperm. Gametes from all 3 are required for fertilization. Evolution has given rise to a long duration of fertility.

- **Woman** - Having to bear offspring, this sex has wider hips and is taller than the other two. Woman is highly tolerant of physical and emotional pain. Woman is typically chosen as a leader of the family as they contribute the most genetic material to the offspring (50% via a two-chromesome egg). This is contentious to some in Pangum, where democracy is decided by families. Many believe that the future of Pangum is controlled by woman since a family's decision is made behind closed doors and posted by the leader of the family. I will use the terms "woman", "girl", "she", and "her" to describe this sex.

- **Man** - This sex is a carrier of his own gametes and those of the Ofan which form a two-chromesome sperm. Man is typically slower in movement but higher in dexterity. I will use the terms "man", "boy", "he", "him", and "his" to refer to this sex.

- **Ofan** - This sex has mammary glands that develop after woman releases pheremones during pregnancy. Although Earth females breastfeed, the physiological traits and instincts of the Ofan aren't quite matched to woman, so it would be inaccurate call the Ofan this. In physical terms, this sex typically has medium hips, low bmi, shorter stature and a faster pulse. Þrongia Ofan are quick-thinking and are typically good at making split-second decisions. The Ofan developed these traits to protect already-born offspring. Children are the closest to their Ofan parent, which I will call mother. I will use the terms "ofan", "kaln", "þe", and "þeir" to refer to this sex.



## Life

Like most animates, þrongia spend their first years learning, working, and forming friendships. Biologically, they begin developing into adults after about 20 Pangum years and continue until 30. Þrongia will often have two-member relationships when they begin puberty, and will form more stable three-member relationships toward the end of the phase as they begin to form families. At 20, most þrongia are able to choose their own paths of life and will work on whatever calls them and whatever their village or city needs. Some will stick with one duty for their whole lives, and others will jump duties with each month. They choose when they retire, oftentimes very late in life. They also choose when to die, typically together with their spouses.



## Religion

þrongian religion states that conscious free will is God, and that beings that forfeit their consciousness and free will in service to another are forfeiting their spirit. In some cases, this is accepted, such as in marriage or in cooperative work efforts. However, slavery and unfair punishments are considered deplorable. Gifts of service are deeply appreciated and it understood that a recipient of a service holds the life of their giver for the duration of service.

As consciousness is god, it is a grave sin to destroy or corrupt another being's consciousness. There is a spectrum of consciousness amongst the animates, and this rule applies amongst all animates. For instance, it is not a sin to murder an insect, but it is a grave sin to murder another large mammalian animate. The only exception is when another being wishes to kill you, as a consciousness that wishes to kill or corrupt is itself corrupt.

the þrongia operate on a sort of theocracy with these beliefs, trusting that this sort of spirituality will operate as a guiding force for future generations to sustain their villages.



## Economics

þrongia work together in villages of ~1000. These villages grow very slowly as each family will at most replace each of the family members per birth. Each person plays a role of their choosing. It is decided by the people whether this role is deemed important or not and disputes about duty fulfillment are heard in village gatherings. Within the village, it is accepted that if you perform an accepted role, that you have the right to a reasonable amount of the commonwealth of goods. There are few disputes about what is reasonable since the village is so small.

When a village grows much greater than 1000, the village and its commonwealth is split - one half stays and other half leaves, taking with it a large portion of the commonwealth. The other half redistributes its housing to expand into the abandoned homes and builds up a new commonwealth.

Trade between villages is common, as Palinan has many microclimates. There is some strain in trade because of disagreements of the definition of fairness across the villages. The beliefs of consciousness and forfeiting free will are stretched to accomodate some trades that seem unfair to a party, and are casting some doubt on the decentralized theocracy.



## Technology

Oil on Palinan is non-existent because of the lack of mass extinction events. This means that plastics and fossil fuels never took off because of their relative scarcity. Mining and electricity, however, are leaned on greatly as the abundance of metallic ore is high in the crust from tidal volcanic activity.

Electrical devices are abundant and cheap. Electromagnetic theory has been mastered, as has the theory of thermodynamics. There is a relative scarcity of rare earths due to the system forming from a smaller star nebula. This makes semiconductors expensive to make, so they are reserved for those who are deemed to need it, such as scientists and in spacecraft.

Power generation is typically done by focusing sunlight from the bright side of the planet onto salt water from the dark side to run steam-powered generators. Clean, hot water from after the turbine is piped to homes through highly insulated pipes. To get cold water, people simply store it in a tank to cool down.

Space flight does not rely on rockets. Instead, þrongia have developed Lorentz-based rail launchers for spacecraft which use energy on the ground to impart a delta-V to the spacecraft without using this delta-V to move fuel.
