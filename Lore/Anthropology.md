## Sexes

There are three sexes in some of the species on Pangum and Surien, including the humanoid species þrongia, although most species have two. In a three-sex species, one sex has eggs, while the other two have sperm. Gametes from all 3 are required for fertilization. Evolution has given rise to a long duration of fertility.

- **Woman** - This sex is more polished and tactful than the other two. Woman is generally the most intelligent of the three and is often thinking about things at a large scale, sometimes to a neurotic fault. I will use the terms "woman", "girl", "she", and "her" to describe this sex.

- **Man** - Generally this sex is quieter in speech, slower in movement, and very dedicated to a goal or task. This sex generally has a stronger sense of morality and judgment, often leading to stubbornness. I will use the terms "man", "boy", "he", "him", and "his" to refer to this sex.

- **Ofan** - Although "female" is often defined as the sex that carries and delivers offspring, the physiological traits and instincts of the Ofan aren't quite matched to man or woman, so it would be inaccurate call the Ofan this. In physical terms, this sex is typically endurant, and pain-tolerant, and more tomboyish in nature than a typical human woman. Þrongia Ofan are quick-thinking and are typically good at making split-second decisions. They are mischievous and open-minded, and they often find a liking for all 3 genders. Children are the closest to their Ofan parent, which I will call mother. I will use the terms "ofan", "kaln", "þe", and "þeir" to refer to this sex.



## Life

Like most animates, þrongia spend their first years learning, working, and forming friendships. Biologically, they begin developing into adults after about 20 Pangum years and continue until 30. Þrongia will often have two-member relationships when they begin puberty, and will form more stable three-member relationships toward the end of the phase as they begin to form families. At 20, most þrongia are able to choose their own paths of life and will work on whatever calls them and whatever their village or city needs. Some will stick with one duty for their whole lives, and others will jump duties with each month. They choose when they retire, oftentimes very late in life. They also choose when to die, typically together with their spouses.
